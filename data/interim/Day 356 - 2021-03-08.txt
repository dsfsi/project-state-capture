PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 08 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Chairperson we are 
going to start the proceedings today by dealing with an 
application brought by Mr Gama to cross-examine Mr Todd 
that is sequence SEQ10 of 2021 you do have the file in 
front of you. 
10 
 
Mr Gama is represented by Counsel I do not know if 
you wish for him to place himself on record before I start 
with my very brief submission? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  You may do so from 
where you are if you are able to do so. 
ADV 
OLDWADGE: 
Thank 
you 
Mr 
Chairperson 
good 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Oldwadge is my surname, initials KC.   
I am a member of the Johannesburg Bar I am instructed in 
20 
this matter by Brian Kahn Incorporated Attorneys.  The two 
ladies seated to my right are in attendance with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 4 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  I am going 
to address you for not more than five or six minutes I know 
that time of the essence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But let me get to the point.  Mr Todd 
Mr Chairperson you will remember gave evidence on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should you not – should Counsel not for 
Mr Gama start or is that the arrangement made between 
the two of you? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am happy for him to start yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might – he might like two bites at the 
Chair so to speak. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As you please Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he can reply.  I think they will 
sanitise the podium and then you can go to the podium.  
Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Oldwadge enquires as to whether 
he could make his submissions from where he is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think if – for this I think he should – 
ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you Mr Chair might I then 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see that you have prepared written 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 5 of 276 
 
submissions which – oh no I think I did see – I see the 
reference to thing – 00:03:00 that case you know that is 
fine I think I have read them. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you.  There is of course the 
issue of condonation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  And I do not simply want to delve into 
the merits of the matter so to speak. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  I do understand from my learned friend 
Mr Myburgh that on behalf of the legal team there does not 
seem to be any opposition to the condonation application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the delay seven days? 
ADV OLDWADGE:  The delay was in fact six calendar 
days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Excluding Saturday and Sunday it 
would have been four week days Mr Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  And if you will permit me what we have 
done under enormous time constraints. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  And I am not going to argue the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 6 of 276 
 
condonation simply to place this before Mr Chair and I 
know of your hectic schedule to the extent that you have 
not considered there was a supplementary set of papers 
filed during the course of the weekend Mr Chair will note 
that due to a large part – my unavailability, various travels 
throughout the country and trials and so forth the founding 
affidavit did not perhaps not enjoy all the consideration 
that it ought to have and when I did have occasion to 
consider it during the course of – towards the end of last 
week I felt that we should supplement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think I have seen the 
supplementary affidavit.  On what page is it in the bundle? 
ADV OLDWADGE:  We – we – it appears as though it has 
not been filed in the bundle Mr Chair.  I note – I know that 
the legal team has been placed in receipt of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  But we do have a copy of it together 
with annexures might we ask that it be received by you?  
Might we approach Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you.  Mr Chair so as not to 
waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe you can con – you can tell me 
what it says. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 7 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  I know we are pressed for time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Sorry Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
OLDWADGE: 
 
Mr 
Chair 
will 
note 
from 
the 
supplementary set of papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second I think it is more 
convenient if you take out the affidavit – the supplementary 
affidavit and annexures and if they need to be brought 
10 
back they can be brought back rather than bring the whole 
file. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  As Mr Chair pleases.  I just did not 
want you to be saddled with loose papers because they are 
not stapled together and we apologise for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes., no, no what they – they can file – 
put them in the right place in the file that I have in due 
course.  Yes you can continue. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  In essence Mr Chair I wish to make 
reference to the difficulties that our client and his legal 
20 
team have experienced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you do that I see that the 
supplementary affidavit seems to be quite substantial.  
ADV OLDWADGE:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought it is a brief affidavit.  I see it is 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 8 of 276 
 
twenty four pages.  I think I will need to read it properly 
that is twenty four pages without the annexures. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Indeed Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think I would need to read it and I 
do not think I can read it this morning for this application 
to proceed this morning.   
ADV OLDWADGE:  I appreciate Mr Chair ’s predicament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I thought it might be two, three or 
five pages or something like that but it is quite substantial 
and I see that it is longer than the – I think it is longer than 
10 
the founding affidavit. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  It is indeed.  We thought it prudent that 
we would explain each and every single… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Factor that read – that led to this delay 
of – of four days Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Whilst it is – it is not a substantial 
period of time I respectfully submit that we are required to 
address it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you are right.  I think the difficulty 
is simply that it arrived you said over the weekend. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not had time – I am seeing it for 
the first time.  It may have been sent to me I do not know 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 9 of 276 
 
maybe I just did not see it but I would need to read it.  
So… 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Mr Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think in terms of – in terms of the 
arrangement your client is supposed to give evidence later 
in the week is it not? 
ADV OLDWADGE:  He was warned to be in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja from today. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  As from today but there is an informal 
arrangement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Between Mr Myburgh and myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  As we understood it there was a 
potential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  That he would be required to testify 
tomorrow afternoon.  I do not know what the position is 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  I think we should adjourn the 
20 
application to tomorrow morning so I can read this – this 
evening.  I do not know whether the legal team had any 
plans of corresponding or they will not be responding 
because that might affect whether we adjourn it to 
tomorrow.  But I can only get a chance to read it tonight. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 10 of 276 
 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Mr Chair I do not wish to speak on 
behalf of Mr Myburgh but the indication that we received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  At least so that I am certain about this 
and clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Is that in relation to condonation per se 
as per the founding affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  There was no opposition. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  I do not know that their position has 
changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
OLDWADGE: 
 
Since 
their 
receipt 
of 
the 
supplementary sets of papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not…  
ADV OLDWADGE:  It is something I can canvass with Mr 
Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does – does the supplementary affidavit 
20 
only seek to supplement the original affidavit in respect of 
condonation? 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Well maybe – I am tempted to 
– to deal with it if that is what – if that is all it does but 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 11 of 276 
 
maybe I should err on the side of caution and rather read 
the 
affidavit. 
 
Probably 
then 
if 
it 
deals 
only 
with 
condonation probably the position may be that the legal 
team does not intend to file anything but Mr Myburgh will 
tell me just now.  So subject to that I think we are – I 
would adjourn the – the application to tomorrow at half 
past nine. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  As you please Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
ADV OLDWADGE:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh and then they 
can just sanitise the podium before Mr Myburgh goes there.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson in relation to the 
supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Which I must confess I have not had 
an opportunity to study. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But it is certainly unlikely given what 
we indicated to the – our opponent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That we would wish to say anything 
in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And we do not intend from our side of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 12 of 276 
 
course it is up to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But you say is confirmation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  So shall we 
say that you will indicated by end of the day if your view 
changes on that?  I do not know if you will get a chance to 
– to look at anything but I just want to know whether we 
can say the application is adjourned to tomorrow half past 
nine. just want to know whether we can say the application 
is adjourned to tomorrow half past nine. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes that would – that would be in 
order Chairperson.  I will give you an undertaking I will 
look at the affidavit over lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And I will – I will come back to you 
straight after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  So this application 
is adjourned to tomorrow at half past nine in the morning.  
Okay.  Your – would the next matter be that of the cross-
examination? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes the next order of business 
Chairperson 
is 
scheduled 
to 
be 
Mr 
Gigaba’s 
cross-
examination of one of the in camera witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I do not know where Mr Pretorius is 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 13 of 276 
 
because I know he is dealing with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he – he ex – he is on – his 
understanding is that we will start at ten so because it is 
still ten to ten he must be on his way.  I think we will 
adjourn until ten o’clock.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
PROCEEDINGS RESUME:  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning everybody.  Are you 
ready? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we are ready Chair.  What is to 
take 
place 
this 
morning 
is 
the 
cross-examination 
of 
Witness No. 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Legal representatives of Witness 
No. 3 are present as well as the legal representatives of 
Mr Gigaba who will conduct the cross-examination.   
20 
 
As the legal representatives of Witness No. 3 may 
apply if appropriate for re-examination in terms of the rules 
perhaps all should place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us do that.  Let us start with the 
legal representatives of Mr Gigaba.  If you are able to – 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 14 of 276 
 
okay they will need to sanitise the podium before you go in 
– you go there and the legal representatives of Witness 
No. 3 may have – may later place themselves on record 
from where they are if it is possible but if not then they will 
proceed to the podium at that stage.   
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  It is Solomon RA SC I appear with my 
learned junior Mr Gumbi instructed by the State Attorneys’ 
office. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  For the former Minister Mr Gigiba and 
we would like to avail ourselves the opportunity of cross-
examining Witness 3.  We do not expect to be terribly long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no you should not be long. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Mr Pretorius I think 
needs to come back to the podium.  Oh I am sorry Ja.  
Counsel for Witness No. 3. 
ADV DUBE: Thank you Chair and good morning.  The name 
20 
is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV DUBE SC:  The name is Sibusiso Dube from 
Bowman’s Chair and I am representing Witness No. 3 in 
these proceedings. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 15 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Dube. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think it might serve a useful 
purpose Mr Pretorius for the benefit of the public if 
possible if you could just give the gist of Witness No. 3’s 
previous 
evidence 
so 
that 
the 
cross 
– 
the 
cross-
examination may they follow it better. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  You would bear with me a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair Witness No. 3 gave evidence 
10 
at the same time as Witnesses No. 1 and Witness No. 2.  
He gave evidence under an order of identity protection 
which we have loosely called in camera but properly 
regarded was an order which allowed him to give evidence 
where his identity was protected and you gave an order 
that that should occur.   
 
Before summarising the evidence of Witness No. 3 
may I just place on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I need the – my file 
that relates to the in camera application.  No that is not the 
20 
one.  But it is among the files that you were given this 
morning Registrar.  It is written on the spine In Camera 
Application.  Okay let me see maybe – maybe I thought it 
was not the – no I think I was wrong.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is necessary to place on 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 16 of 276 
 
record because Witness No. 3 and Witness Nos 1 and 2 – 
Witnesses Nos 1 and 2 gave evidence relating to the same 
category of events as close protection officers and drivers 
of the various government officials and their relationships 
with the Gupta’s and the movement of cash from the 
Gupta’s residence – residences implicating various parties 
including Mr Gigaba.   
On 
Saturday 
and 
this 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
public 
knowledge 
at 
the 
moment 
what 
the 
commission’s 
investigation team together with the securiated as advisors 
10 
have concluded was a – an assignation attempt on Witness 
No. 1 and it is necessary just to place that on record.  The 
matter has been reported to the authorities and the 
security of all the three witnesses; Witness 1, Witness 2 
and Witness 3 is being attended to. 
It is necessary therefore for the Order of Witness 
Protection to remain no further order is required from 
yourself.   
But Witness No. 3 gave evidence Chair that over 
two periods of time and in various official capacities he 
20 
was a driver and a security – close security protectional 
officer to Mr Gigaba and he relates his eyewitness 
evidence of what he observed when Mr Gigaba visited the 
premises of the Gupta’s in Saxonwold and how the events 
showed that Mr Gigaba was dealing with cash which 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 17 of 276 
 
Witness No. 3 concluded had come from the residence of 
the Gupta’s at the particular time. 
There were two periods one before 2009 and one in 
the mid – between 2010 and 2018 there around 2015 which 
are relevant to the evidence. 
It is necessary then for Witness No. 3 to take the 
oath once more.  Witness No. 3 is giving evidence remotely 
from a private location – undisclosed location put it that 
way.  Counsel who worked with me on the matter Verushka 
September is at present with Witness No. 3.  She will 
10 
confirm that she is in the presence of Witness No.3.  
Witness No. 3 can then take the oath and she will confirm 
that it is indeed to her knowledge Witness No. 3 that has 
taken the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that is fine.  Before we do that 
I just want to say that it is most concerning that attempts 
by some in our society cont – seem to continue to 
intimidate and attack people who – who want to assist this 
nation on the matters that this commission is investigating. 
 
People 
want 
to 
assist 
this 
commission 
to 
20 
understand what happened in regard to the matters that it 
is 
investigating. 
 
It 
is 
completely 
unacceptable 
that 
witnesses whether they have given evidence before the 
commission or are still going to give evidence before the 
commission are targeted and attacked and attempts are 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 18 of 276 
 
made on their lives.  Attempts are made to kill them.  It is 
completely 
unacceptable 
and 
I 
would 
ask 
the 
law 
enforcement agencies to please assist this commission by 
dealing with these matters expeditiously because those 
who seek to silence people who want to assist the 
commission; who want to assist the nation to understand 
what happened seemed to be quite determined to continue 
and attacks on one person whether he or she has 
previously given evidence or is still to give evidence may 
well deter many others that the commission wishes to hear 
10 
from on the matters that it is investigating. 
 
I applaud the courage of various people in our 
country who despite threats to their own safety and to their 
lives and to the safety and lives of their loved ones have 
nevertheless come before this commission to assist the 
nation to understand what happened with regard to the 
matters that we are investigating. 
 
I applaud those who will still continue to come to 
the 
commission 
to 
give 
evidence 
or 
to 
assist 
the 
commission in any way despite these acts of intimidation 
20 
and criminality by some in our society who silence people 
who want to assist this commission. 
 
I hope that the law enforcement agency will act with 
speed to deal with these matters and to protect all 
witnesses 
who 
are 
under 
threat 
wish 
to 
assist 
this 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 19 of 276 
 
commission or whoever assisted this commission. 
 
I thank Witness 3 that he has once again made 
himself available to assist the commission despite the 
reports that have been heard of the attempted killing of 
Witness 1.  We are grateful that Witness 1 survived the 
attack. 
 
Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Noted Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We are going to start Ms September 
you there? 
10 
MS SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You confirm that you are with Witness 1 
where you are? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Witness 3. 
 No Chair I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Witness 3 I am sorry – 
Witness 3?  Do you confirm that you are with Witness 3 
where you are? 
 Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I have previously seen 
20 
Witness 3 he previously took an oath in front of me so if a 
member of the legal team confirms that she is with Witness 
3 I accept that.  Witness 3 good morning to you. 
WITNESS 3:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Witness 3 for 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 20 of 276 
 
availing yourself to once again come and assist the 
commission.  We appreciate that very much.   
WITNESS 3:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Registrar will administer the oath to 
you now when she says give your full names do not give 
your real names just say Witness 3, is that alright 
WITNESS 3:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Registrar you may go 
ahead. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
10 
WITNESS 3:  My name is Witness 3. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS 3:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
20 
help me God. 
WITNESS 3:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Then Witness 3 you will be 
cross-examined by Counsel for Mr Gigaba.  I normally put 
the – fix the duration of the cross-examination at the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 21 of 276 
 
beginning of the cross-examination. Counsel for Mr Gigaba 
do you – I do not think you should need anything more than 
45 minutes? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chair I thought about an hour should 
suffice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us say 45 minutes but 
we will see at the end of 45 minutes how it goes if it is 
necessary to – to go into an hour – to an hour then we will 
– I will – I will allow you. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chair I just wanted to enquire.  I am 
going to refer the witness to his statement and to a 
transcript of his evidence 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   As well as an extract from the 
Fundudzi Report that comments upon his employment.  
Does he have access to all the documentation wherever he 
is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He should be but Mr Pretorius will know 
20 
better.   
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Well we will 
CHAIRPERSON:  He should have access to all documents 
that were known to the legal team as the documents that 
would be used in the cross-examination. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 22 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair if the witness is going to be 
referred to a report to which we have not had access we 
will deal with that.  I have just confirmed with the legal 
representatives of Witness 3 that the report referred to has 
not been drawn to their attention nor ours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But for the rest the transcripts and 
the documentation relevant to the evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The witness has in front of him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so I think there will be a 
problem with the report because it looks like nobody was 
given notice that it could be – it would be used. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   It was furnished to us from the 
evidence leader Mr Myburgh but – but I can – I can tell him 
what is in the report and if Mr Pretorius has any objection 
we can verify that.  It is – I will give the page number and I 
will – I will read the finding – one of the findings I think 
20 
there are two in fact if that would be in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well it may well be- well 
1. They say the witness does not have the report it 
might be the best situation to just answer something 
in relation to a report where you might not know the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 23 of 276 
 
context. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Should we proceed and see the 
00:20:01 that unfolds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe if – if – maybe if while you 
proceed Counsel for Witness 3 and Mr Pretorius have 
access to the report and you indicate to them in what area 
you want to ask questions about while you proceed they 
might be having a look at – at the relevant portion of the 
report and when you are done with other aspects of your 
cross-examination we can check with them whether they 
10 
have any problem. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is the question of – of 
course they might have an idea whether the witness could 
fairly be asked to answer questions even if she has not – 
he has not seen the report. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you Chair I place on record it 
is – is BB27 Bundle 2 page 272.  That is where the report 
is located. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just repeat the reference so that 
20 
in case somebody did not get it correctly down. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Certainly.  It is BB27 Bundle 2 page 
272. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think Counsel for Witness 3 
looks at me as if to say I do not have it and I think he sees 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 24 of 276 
 
Mr Myburgh giving Mr Pretorius a copy.  Maybe if he does 
not have maybe once Mr Pretorius has looked at it – at the 
relevant portion he might share with him and then we take 
it from there. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you Chair.  Perhaps then I 
can continue and in the background Mr Pretorius and 
perhaps Mr Myburgh because he – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   He in fact had shared that bundle 
with us. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Mr Pretorius would like to 
say something. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair there is a problem.  I 
have just looked at the page names are revealed on the 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which would be a gross violation of 
the order you make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And in the circumstances. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC:  Of 
what has happened this 
weekend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  This is a serious problem. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 25 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So – we object to that being put in 
without prior arrangements being made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And my learned friend can come 
back and deal with those at a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Once there have been proper 
redactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But now already on public record 
there is a reference and names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it is just quite unacceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  So the matter we strongly object to 
anything of this sort coming before you today without 
proper arrangements being made for redactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Yes Chair we have no – no difficulty 
20 
I was never intending to – to reveal the identities through 
the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I just wanted to read a finding into 
the record. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 26 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   But could we then just reserve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   The cross-examination on that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And perhaps we can – we could…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until you have had discussions with 
Counsel for – Witness 3 and Mr Pretorius and then we will 
take the matter from there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  But Chair that does not solve 
10 
the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Which is that this a matter of – this 
document is the matter of public record already and the 
reference has been given so perhaps I should draw no 
more attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think we must all be quite careful 
that there is apart from an intentional disclosure of 
information that should not be disclosed there could be 
situation where unintentionally information is disclosed 
20 
which could lead to disclosure of identities so we all just 
need to check very carefully. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chairperson it is – it is just to tell 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 27 of 276 
 
you Chair it would be simply to – to put to the witness this 
is what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no … 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   This was one of the findings… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  Remember the arrangement 
is that you will have discussions with Mr Pretorius and 
Counsel for Witness 3.  When the three of you have 
discussed maybe you find a way then that can be told to 
me and then I can take it from there.  So for now we will 
exclude that part of your cross-examination. 
10 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Oh thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Then just – just to tell you – Witness 
3 I – the topics that I just want to touch on.   
First would be your meeting with Mr Gigaba at the 
commencement of your re-employment.   
Secondly I want to touch on the role you played as 
part of the security detail.   
Then your evidence about the visits to the Gupta’s 
in Saxonwold.   
20 
Next to deal with the logbooks and the diaries that 
may take a bit of time. 
Then your evidence about visits by other parties at 
the same time. 
Then the question of the cash that you spoke about. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 28 of 276 
 
Your evidence about the items of apparel that Mr 
Gigaba apparently purchased. 
Reference to Mr Molefe in your evidence and then 
also the timing of your complaint. 
And then we will reserve the question of the 
Fundudzi Report if we may? 
Now Witness 3 you have your – your affidavit that 
you furnished to the commission, do you have it?  I think it 
was dated 14 September 2020.  The witness could confirm 
that he – he has access to his affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Witness 3 can you hear us? 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay which affidavit would you like him 
to confirm to have? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   His affidavit that he deposed to for 
the benefit of the commission the 14 t h of September 2020 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got that affidavit Witness 3?   
Are you looking for it or did you not hear me?  Ms 
September are you there? 
20 
WITNESS 3:  I do have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You must just tell me if you 
are still looking so that I know that you have heard me.  
Okay ja he says he has got it. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I wanted to refer you to paragraph 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 29 of 276 
 
123 paragraph 10 – page 123 paragraph 10 of your Witness 
Statement.  Do you have that Witness 3? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Apologies Chair just for the record. 
WITNESS 3:  Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is Bundle BB14(d). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am trying to look at what I am 
having in front of me and I could not see – just repeat the 
bundle Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Bundle BB14(d).  The affidavit 
begins at page 122.  It is Exhibit 14D Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  My Registrar says if it is an Eskom 
bundle we do not have it here.  Is it an Eskom Bundle? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It is a Transnet Bundle as I 
understand it Chair.  Perhaps I could let you have my copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  If – while she is looking – 
okay Registrar let me have Mr Pretorius bundle while you 
look for – for the right one.  Check if we do not have it 
here.  Arrange for the protectors to go and get it.  Okay, I 
have got it.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   May I proceed Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Does Witness 3 have the affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he said he has got it. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 30 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Thank you.  Now I just want to put 
to you what Mr Gigaba says in regard to your allegation 
that you met with him at the commencement of your 
employment around – prior the commencement of your 
employment in April 2013.   
 
He says that his security details were dealt with 
his Chief of Staff, Mr Thani Mesome and he did not get 
involved in the recruitment process of the discussions with 
you, as you say.   
 
He denies that he had any meeting with you.  All 
10 
of these arrangements would have been attended to by Mr 
Mesome.  Do you agree with him in that regard? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair.  On the day in question, I 
have met the Chief of Staff and our meeting I was informed 
that I should not leave the office, the minister wanted to 
see me.  And indeed, yes, I have met the Minister after our 
meeting at the Chief of Staff. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Alright.  Now in paragraph 16 of 
your affidavit, you will find that at page 124, you say that 
Mr Gigaba would travel in the BMW vehicle with two SAPS 
20 
VIP Officers and your vehicle would follow.   
 
So you were part of a security personnel in the 
back of the motor vehicle as you were not a member of the 
SAPS at the time.  It would have been improper for you to 
have travelled in his vehicle in that capacity.  Do you 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 31 of 276 
 
agree? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I agree. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And as such, you did not have 
access to the principle motor vehicle.  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Now if we could then move on to 
the next topic of the number of visits to the Gupta’s.  You 
say that he visited between the period that you were 
employed in the capacity that you have described, like, a 
period of six months, from July to December 2013.  You 
10 
have said on about six or seven occasions.  Is that 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Now you say to that.  On one of the 
occasions, you drove Mr Gigaba alone.  Now how did that 
come about?  Would that not have been a most serious 
breach of protocol that we have just agreed upon a few 
moments ago? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair.  I think on the day in 
question as well, the Minister informed me after we logged 
20 
off that he would like me to take him somewhere and I 
waited until some of my colleagues left and he went in to 
refresh and I waited until he came into the car and we 
drove.  On the way, he informed me that we are going to 
the Gupta residence. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 32 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So now you ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 3:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Sorry? 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I interrupted you.  Had you 
finished? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I am finished.  Thank you. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes.  But would that not have been 
a breach of protocol?  You were not a member of the SAPS 
and you were not authorised to drive Mr Gigaba anywhere. 
10 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   But I was informed – he - I was given 
instructions by the Minister himself. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And would you just slavishly follow 
his instructions even though it would be a breach of your 
employment conditions and the SAPS protocols? 
WITNESS 3:   I think I was sitting as a member, and 
honestly, I took instruction and I honoured the instruction.  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Alright.  I just want to put to you 
20 
that Mr Gigaba denies that you ever drove on any 
occasion, let alone to the Gupta residence.  Would you like 
to comment? 
WITNESS 3:   No, on the day, yes, I drove the Minister to 
the Gupta residence. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 33 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I also want to put to you that he 
denies that he visited their residence on a number of 
occasion that you describe and that at the most it would 
have been once or twice during that period of time.  Would 
you like to comment? 
WITNESS 3:   I have gone with the Minister at the 
residence for about six to seven times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  Did you find the file? 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh, 
okay 
alright. 
 
I 
am 
sorry.   
10 
Mr Pretorius(sic), I wanted to return your file if she had 
found ours but she did not find it.  And they are trying to 
get it from the residence.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Certainly Mr Chair.  Should I 
continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Now, of course, the way of testing 
your evidence against Mr Gigaba’s on a number of visits 
would be to have regard to the diaries and logbooks 
because they would provide the independent and objective 
20 
evidence.  Do you agree with me? 
WITNESS 3:   Repeat the question. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Of course, the way to resolve the 
dispute between you and Mr Gigaba about the number of 
visits to the Gupta’s residence in Saxonwold would be to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 34 of 276 
 
have regard to the objective independent in the form of his 
diary and your logbook.  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I agree. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Were any of these visits that you 
have testified about now recorded in Mr Gigaba’s diary? 
WITNESS 3:   No, they were not. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Could I refer you to your evidence?  
It is at Bundle 2, BB-24, page 244, lines 22 to 25. 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She is just trying to find the bundle for 
10 
me. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Chair, whilst you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to just repeat the bundle 
number and everything unless she has found it.  Okay, she 
has found it.  Maybe the page number? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Chair, it is BB-24-244, lines to 22 
to 25. 
WITNESS 3:   I do not have that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Witness 3.  Is this the 
right file? 
20 
REGISTRAR:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  There seems to be a problem with 
the reference. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes.  Mr Chair, Mr Pretorius is 
telling 
me 
that 
I 
should 
use 
the 
SEQ-07/20201-51 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 35 of 276 
 
reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What bundle is it, first, if it is a bundle? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   If I could just place it on record 
again Chair?  It is Bundle SEQ-07/20201. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that will not be a bundle as such 
but I think I know which document it is.  Mr Pretorius, is it 
the in-camera application? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, a bundle was prepared for 
the particular purposes of this cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It contains several documents.  It 
is SEQ-07/20201.  It is in the file that was given to you 
Chair and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Thank you Mr Pretorius.  It was 
under another file.  I think I have got too many files here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand completely 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But the bundle that my learned 
friend is referring to has certain references.  The bundle 
before you has other references. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we can get a common 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 36 of 276 
 
reference at the bottom of the page which has the page of 
the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So if my learned friend can put his 
reference on record because that is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then also put the page number 
at the bottom of the page, then we can all follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, okay.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   That is in order then Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I will also just try and follow my 
learned friend’s page numbers but then it is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you just give the reference afresh so 
that... 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is SEQ, page 51 and it is typed 
page 115. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I think your SEQ reference is not 
20 
complete.  Is it SEQ-07/20201? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is the correct reference. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you say page? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 37 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is page 51 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the red number or at the bottom? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Well, I will give both numbers.  It is 
page 51 of that bundle and it is typed page 115 at the 
bottom of 152. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Do you have it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is page 51 on the red numbers at 
the right top corner and page 115 at the bottom. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it Witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Now you were asked there:   
“Were any of these visits recorded in the 
Minister ’s diary?”   
 
And you say:   
“Yes, they were Chair.  They were handed over 
to Witness 1.” 
 
So which is the correct answer then Witness 3? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you.  In some of the occasions I was 
informed by then Minister not to register the movements to 
– the visits to the Gupta family house in Saxonwold. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   That was on some of the 
occasions? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 38 of 276 
 
WITNESS 3:   Correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   But on other occasions not.  And 
were they recorded? 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3, can you hear us? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
question 
is 
whether 
you 
...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 3:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether your evidence is 
10 
that 
one 
some 
occasions 
these 
visits 
to 
the 
Gupta 
residence 
were 
recorded 
in 
the 
diary 
but 
on 
other 
occasions they were not recorded.  Is that your evidence? 
WITNESS 3:   Not(?) correct Chair.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Sorry, I did not hear?  Did you say 
that is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said that is correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Now if you go to page – your 
affidavit at page 125, 20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am afraid you will just have to 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is BB-14 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...reference because we are using 
different... 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Sorry. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 39 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes, Chair.  And can I just say to, 
perhaps Chair, without being prescriptive to you and 
Witness 3?   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It would be useful of both of those 
bundles stay open all the time because I am just going to 
move between them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And so... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine but each time you 
refer just for the transcript. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I shall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be important to say ...[intervenes]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To record, ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ordinarily ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So it is BB-14(d) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Witness [1-3-125]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the page numbers? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And – well, 125 is the page 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 40 of 276 
 
number.  It is paragraph 20.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is the red numbers at the top 
right hand corner, 125. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Do you have it Witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Say again? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is at the foot of the page, 20.1 
and 20.2.  I will read it out.  It says: 
“None of these visits were recorded in the 
Minister ’s diary...” 
 
And then 20.2: 
10 
“By instruction of the Minister I did not record 
the trips to the Gupta’s residence in the 
logbook of my allocated vehicle as those were 
unofficial trips...” 
 
Do you see that? 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you see that Witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do Chair. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So is that what – is that evidence 
incorrect? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Because we understand from what 
you have just old the Chair now that not all the trips were 
recorded but some were.  Now you are saying none were 
recorded.  And you realise the importance of having a 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 41 of 276 
 
record of these visits.  So we have an objective, an 
independent 
mechanism 
to 
test 
the 
veracity 
of 
your 
evidence.   
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Would you care to comment? 
WITNESS 3:   Like I said earlier on.  I was – in some of the 
occasions I was informed by the Minister himself not to 
record all the visits on the logbook.  And yes, some 
occasions we recorded, some we did not.  And we tried to 
locate the logbooks from our offices and they could not find 
10 
them. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So let me just try and sum up your 
evidence.  You have said on various occasions...  I have 
shown you what you initially said.  Is that these visits were 
recorded and they were handed over to Witness 1.   
 
Then you have said some were recorded, some 
were not.  Then you have said in your statement that I 
have just read to you, none of them were recorded because 
that was the instructions of the Minister.   
 
And now you are also telling us that we cannot 
20 
verify and test your evidence because the logbooks are 
nowhere to be found.  Is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, okay if he has answered, I thought 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 42 of 276 
 
you might break it up into manageable propositions. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to make sure that...  Ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So let me just try and summarise 
your evidence in each part.  You have said initially that 
there was a log and a record of the visits and they were 
handed over to Witness 1.  Do you agree?  We have gone 
through that in your evidence. 
WITNESS 3:   I do agree. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Then you have said that, in your 
10 
oral evidence this morning, questions from the Chair that 
some of the visits were recorded, others not.  Do you 
agree? 
WITNESS 3:   I agree. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Then you say in your statement 
that we have just looked at, paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2, that 
none of the visits were in fact recorded.  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   Some of the visits were recorded, some were 
not recorded.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   But then your statement is wrong, 
20 
your affidavit, paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before you put that.  What 
counsel was putting to you Witness 3 was that in your 
affidavit, particularly in paragraphs 20.1 and 20.2, you 
have said none of the visits were recorded in the Minister ’s 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 43 of 276 
 
diary and you said by instruction of the Minister you did 
not record the trips to the Gupta residence in the logbook 
of your vehicle.  He just wanted you to confirm that you 
accept that that is what your affidavit says.  Do you agree 
with that? 
WITNESS 3:   I fully agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  I think you can take it 
from there.   
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Thank you.  And then we know that 
you say the logbooks and diary are not being produced for 
10 
this Commission because they are not available.  Is that 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So at the end of the day, we have 
just your word against Mr Gigaba’s word.  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, Chair.  Just for the sake of 
clarity.  There seems to be some confusion between 
logbooks on the one hand and diaries on the other.  As I 
recall the evidence of Witness number 3 was that it was 
20 
not that the logbooks and diary were unavailable that know 
what the position about the diary.  He said the logbooks 
were not available.  So I think the position should remain 
clear throughout.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 44 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   But in any event, on your version, 
they were not recorded in the diary of the Minister on his 
instruction.  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So if I could again just put my 
proposition.  We only have your word against the Minister ’s 
world for this.  We have no way of testing your version 
against the objective evidence.   
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe you should still say against 
10 
the records of either the diary or the logbook. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it will be much more clearer to 
him.  Ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So in the absence of the logbooks 
and the diary, we only have your word for it as to the 
number of visits that occurred?  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Do you agree Witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Agree. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   I agree on the basis that with the... I have 
visited the Gupta residence six or seven times.  That I 
agree with. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Well, the ...[intervenes]  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 45 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the proposition was.  You agree 
that because there is no written record of the visits, either 
in the Minister ’s diary or in the logbook.  Then as to what 
the true position is, the Commission needs to depend on 
your word as well as the word of the former minister, 
Minister Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:   That I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And then just to refer you to your 
evidence at page 116 ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What...what...what ...[intervenes]  
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   So it is again Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  I think they have got my 
file.  So let us return Mr Pretorius(sic) so that he can have 
access to it.  Thank you. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is SEQ-07/2021 at paginated 
page 52 and typed page 116.  Does Chair have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just give me the page again? 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   It is the SEQ-07/2021 Bundle, 
paginated page 52, typed page 116. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it.  Thank you. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Does Witness 3 have it? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And you will see about line 14, 
Mr Pretorius asked you: 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 46 of 276 
 
“So were they or were they not recorded in the 
Minister ’s diary?” 
 
He says: 
“They were not recorded at all.” 
 
And then he goes on: 
“And did you record these trips in the logbook 
of your vehicle?” 
“He informed us we should not record this 
information in the logbook.  So we did not.” 
“Did he give you a reason for telling you to not 
10 
record them in your vehicle logbook?” 
 
He says: 
“No reason was given to us.” 
 
So I have already made the point that that 
evidence is in conflict with what you have said today 
because you have said that there were some occasions 
where it was in fact recorded but I am putting that passage 
of the evidence to you to enhance it to what Mr Pretorius 
had said about the confusion with logbooks and the 
Minister ’s diary.  I think that evidence clears it up.  Do you 
20 
agree? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be clearer if ...[intervenes]  
WITNESS 3:   I agree Chair.  [Parties intervening each 
other – unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...you 
specifically 
say 
what 
the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 47 of 276 
 
confusion was that you see to address. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if that clears it up. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   And the confusion relates to 
whether it was on all occasions that there was no record or 
whether there was indeed some occasions where there was 
a note made either in the diary or the logbook. 
WITNESS 3:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SOLOMONS SC:   But you do not need to respond.  I 
think 
you 
have 
responded. 
 
Now 
in 
regard 
to 
this 
instruction, did you not feel uncomfortable about breaching 
your standing orders concerning logging or trips that you 
were involved in, in the vehicle on the instruction of the 
Minister?  Did it not strike you as something you should 
not adhere to, that instruction? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you Chair.  I [word cut off] the event 
to my superior, which is witness one in this case, but I am 
told that by the minister that I should not record these 
20 
trips.  So he was informed as my line manager. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And was it recorded in writing? 
WITNESS 3:   No, I had verbal meeting with him. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And has he given evidence in that 
regard, to your knowledge? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 48 of 276 
 
WITNESS 3:   No. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   So again it is just your word that we 
have to accept that this report was made, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I just want to put to you that Mr 
Gigaba denies having given any such instruction.  The 
issue of recording trips in a log book is a matter that fell 
within the authorities of the officers in their capacities as 
members of SAPS and in your case part of the security 
detail.  Do you want to comment?  Would you care to 
10 
comment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3, can you hear us? 
WITNESS 3:   I think I missed some of the part, I could not 
hear clearly, can you please repeat? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I certainly will.  I am saying Mr 
Gigaba denies that he gave you any such instruction, his 
evidence is that the issue of recording trips in the log book 
is a matter that fell within the authority of the SAPS and in 
your instance subject to your protocols, he did not instruct 
you or any of the other officers …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, I think let us 
break it up.  First, witness 3, counsel for Mr Gigaba says 
that Mr Gigaba’s version is that he never gave you such 
instructions.  What do you say to that? 
WITNESS 3:   He instructed me that I should not records 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 49 of 276 
 
the trips in the logbook. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and counsel for Mr Gigaba will now 
tell you what Mr Gigaba has to say in substantiation of this 
denial that he gave such instructions.  Yes, you may 
proceed. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you.  And he also says he did 
not instruct any of the other offices not to record any trip in 
their logbook, it was not his business to do so and he had 
no authority to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say to that? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   He would give that instruction and will have 
to honour as the minister, he will be our client and we will 
have to honour by that. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now of there were at least two 
vehicles at all times that accompanied the minister, is that 
correct?  One, the BMW and then your vehicle behind, is 
that right? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And the vehicle he was in, there 
would be log of the visits would there not, through the 
20 
SAPS?  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:    Yes, I agree. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Have a seen a log of those visits? 
WITNESS 3:   No. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Have you ever enquired about them? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 50 of 276 
 
WITNESS 3:   No, I never enquired. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Okay, let us move on then, we will 
move on to another topic now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do so, I see – I think we are 
at about 40 minutes, what is your assessment of how much 
more time you need? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chair, I would say 15 to 20 minutes, 
if that would suit you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Let us go up to quarter 
past eleven, then we take the tea break and when we come 
10 
back – it is now about nine minutes past, when it is quarter 
then we will take the tea break.  When we come back you 
will need only about ten minutes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair, could I ask your 
indulgence to prompt me when the time is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, alright, okay, okay. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now you say that 
on occasions that you were with the minister at the Gupta 
residence you saw four individuals.  You mentioned Mr 
Molefe, Koko, Mr Ngubane and Mabaso.  Do you agree?  
20 
Do you recall that? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I agree. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now Mr Gigaba denies that on the 
occasions that he went there, one or two occasions in that 
six month period that these individuals were there at any 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 51 of 276 
 
time that he was there between July and December 2013.  
Would you care to comment? 
WITNESS 3:   I think that is not true, I think I saw them 
when I was with him there, he would have seen them as 
well. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now he tells me – and I want to just 
put it to you, that in far as Mr Ben Ngubane is concerned, 
he only became the Chair of Eskom in 2016 as far as he 
can recall and that period in 2013, as far as Mr Gigaba is 
concerned, Mr Ngubane was an ambassador in Chile.  
10 
Would you care to comment? 
WITNESS 3:   I have seen Mr Ngubane at the residence as 
well in 2013. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And also by the same token 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I think witness 3 might not 
have appreciated your question.  The question, witness 3, 
is whether you are in a position to deny Mr Gigaba’s 
statement 
that 
in 
2013 
Dr 
Ben 
Ngubane 
was 
not 
Chairperson of Eskom but was an ambassador – was the 
20 
ambassador of South Africa in Chile or China? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chile.  Okay.  Do you have any 
comments about that? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 52 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is your comment, what is your 
response? 
WITNESS 3:   The response is in 2013 I have seen Mr 
Ngubane at the Gupta residence, not necessarily that he 
was the Chairman of any portfolio but I have seen him in 
the residence in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I take it that what you mean is 
that you might not be in a position to say what his position 
was in 2013 but what you are saying is that you saw him at 
the Gupta residence, is that correct? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, does that help? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And then by the same token Mr 
Mabaso only became the Chair of Transnet in either 2014 
or 2015.  Do you care to comment on that? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I saw Mr Mabaso, I did not know her 
portfolio then but I have seen her at the residence as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This might not change anything, counsel, 
20 
but because I have been hearing Eskom evidence I can 
indicate that Dr Ben Ngubane became Acting Chairperson 
of the Eskom board in I think March 2015 and at some 
stage, I think in 2015 still became Chairperson of the 
board but in 2016 he was Chairperson of the Eskom board. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 53 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you for that, Chair.  Then if I 
could just take you to your transcript of your evidence, that 
is SEQ0721, page 53. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe this might be the convenient 
time to take the tea adjournment. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea adjournment now, it 
is quarter past eleven, we will resume at half past eleven.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.  You will try and 
keep within ten minutes?  Okay, alright.  Just switch on 
your mic. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may proceed. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I also just want to 
put on record, witness 3, that Mr Gigaba denies that on 
occasion that he was there as you testified that President 
Zuma’s convoy was there at the same time.  You can 
20 
comment or you cannot comment, it is up to you, I am just 
putting that on record. 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you, Chair.  In one occasion on our 
visit yes indeed I have seen the convoy of the former 
President, Mr Zuma, leaving the compound. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 54 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I interrupted you, continue? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you, I was saying in one occasion as 
we were at the Gupta residence I then saw the convoy of 
the then Deputy President Mr Zuma leaving the compound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question.  When you saw 
the convoy where were you, where about in the compound 
were you? 
WITNESS 3:   We were coming into the yard, the premises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Mr Gigaba in the car and if so 
where? 
10 
WITNESS 3:   He was still in the car as I was parking the 
vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he in the same car as you? 
WITNESS 3:   I was in the back of car, yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he in another car and you were in 
another car? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Was he in a position to have seen 
what you saw namely former President Zuma’s convoy? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes because the motorcade, it is quite a 
20 
number of cars.  I am of the view that he have seen the 
motor vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you.  Now let us move on to 
the question of cash.  You, on your version, attended with 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 55 of 276 
 
Mr Gigaba and the Saxonwold residence of the Guptas on 
six or seven occasions, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And you say in an earlier period of 
time you also observed him at the premises of Sahara in I 
think 2004, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now you have also testified, I have 
seen from your testimony and your statement that you 
observed a number of people, I do not need to call out 
10 
their names, we know who they are.  On various occasions, 
carrying bags with money and then going to deposit that 
money at a vault somewhere, I am not sure where you 
described it, I do not think it is important.  Do you agree 
with me? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   On none of the occasions did you 
ever see Mr Gigaba carrying – coming to or from either 
Sahara or the Gupta residence with a bag full of money, is 
that correct? 
20 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And on no occasion did you take into 
a vault and witnessing what you surmise to be the 
depositing of money, is that correct?  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   I do not remember taking the minister to the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 56 of 276 
 
vault. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Sorry, I did not hear that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says he does not remember taking 
the minister to the vault. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Yes.  Well, had you done so you 
would have remembered. 
WITNESS 3:   Of course, yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Yes.  So we can assume you never 
did, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And then if we go to your witness 
statement, Chair, BB14d witness 1-3-126, paragraphs 25 to 
28.  Does Chair have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got page 126 and I have go the 
bundle, you say paragraphs? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   25 and over the page up to 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   You see, Chair, it is headed Cash 
Carried by Gigaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Does witness three have it? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now you do not need to read that 
out, you can cast your eye over it.  There is no reference 
there in your statement to Mr Gigaba having collected or 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 57 of 276 
 
received any cash from the Gupta residence, is that 
correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now could you then explain why in 
your evidence which we find, Chair, SEQ07/21 paginated 
page 55, typed page 119.  Does Chair have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 55? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I did, Chair, and 119, at the foot of 
the page, typed page 119. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, I have got it, ja. 
10 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Does witness 3 have it? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do. 
WITNESS 3:   So can you explain if you look at line 14, 
really starts at line 12, you were asked by Mr Pretorius: 
“Are you able to say where the money came from?” 
And you say: 
“I could not tell that time but as, as we make some 
visits, then I could connect the dots to say the 
money came from the Saxonwold residence.” 
And then I am going to take you through Mr Pretorius’ 
20 
questions but let us just focus on that.  So here you are 
saying that you are able to tell the Commission that you 
say that the cash that you allegedly saw in the possession 
of Mr Gigaba he acquired and got possession of from the 
Gupta residence, is that correct? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 58 of 276 
 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Now can you explain to the Chair 
why you were prepared to make that statement when you 
have admitted that you never saw him on six or seven 
occasions, as you did with other witnesses, collecting 
money from the Gupta residence, why were you prepared 
to make that statement incriminating my client with no 
evidence whatsoever? 
WITNESS 3:   Thank you, Chair.  I think I was of the view 
that the money that I had seen carried by the minister, the 
10 
former minister, came from the Gupta family, it is because 
in my view every time that we go there, maybe after a day 
or two, I would see money from the boot of his car in a bag 
full of money, hence I said I connected the dots.  I meant 
that I was of the view that he may have found the money 
from the Gupta. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   But you had six or seven occasions 
to observe him, as you observed other witnesses, and you 
have confirmed that on none of those occasions did you 
see him taking a bag into or coming with a bag out of the 
20 
Gupta residence or observing that he was taking cash from 
there.  You have conceded that.  Do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I agree. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I want to know why you were 
prepared to come to this Commission and speculate and 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 59 of 276 
 
draw conclusions adverse to my client to incriminate him 
without any evidence whatsoever.  I would like you to 
explain why you felt that was part of your function coming 
to give evidence before this Commission. 
WITNESS 3:   Like I said, I was of the view that he may 
have found the money from the Gupta because of our 
frequent visits to the compound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me put this question.  Are you able 
to concede that what you were saying, namely that you 
could connect the dots to say the money came from the 
10 
Saxonwold residence, and would it be correct to say that 
was simply a suspicion on your part? 
WITNESS 3:   It may be, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I do not if that helps, Mr… 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And you did not voice that suspicion 
in your statement.  I take it your statement was taken in 
consultation with one of the evidence leaders, perhaps Mr 
Pretorius, Advocate Pretorius, and is that correct?  Is it 
20 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Witness 3, did you hear the question? 
WITNESS 3:   Not really, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether – the question 
is do you agree that in your affidavit you did not express 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 60 of 276 
 
that suspicion? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the next question that counsel for 
Mr Gigaba asked was whether your statement was taken 
from 
you 
by 
one 
of 
the 
evidence 
leaders 
of 
the 
Commission, maybe Mr Pretorius? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   So what we need to understand, 
witness 3, is at the time when you made your statement, 
your affidavit for the purposes of this Commission, you did 
10 
not voice any suspicion and you had not connected the 
dots, is that correct?  Is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   The suspicion has been there but maybe I 
did not voice it to the evidence leader. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says the suspicion was there but 
maybe did not …[intervenes] 
WITNESS 3:   Suspicion has been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe he did not voice it to the 
evidence leader. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   What made you then voice it during 
your evidence, your oral testimony? 
WITNESS 3:   I think I remember now, remember these 
things happened quite some time back.  As I was engaging, 
I started to remember and ja, I said it. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 61 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   So you had forgotten about your 
suspicion when you did your statement, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And you only connected the dots 
when you gave your testimony, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Did anyone assist you in connecting 
those dots between the time that you gave your statement 
on the 14 September 2020 and when you gave your 
evidence?  Do you have an answer? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear the question, witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Chair, could you please clarify the question 
for me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether anybody 
assisted you to connect the dots before you gave evidence 
and said that you connected the dots and concluded that 
the money came from the Saxonwold residence? 
WITNESS 3:   No one assisted me, Chair. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Right.  You have said that Mr Gigaba 
appeared nervous to you when he was – exited the vehicle, 
20 
is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:    That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   But he was not in your vehicle, how 
could you have observed that? 
WITNESS 3:   On the drop-off he jumped out of the car and 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 62 of 276 
 
he started to run towards the main door.  For me it was 
very odd, unusual for him to be running into a meeting in 
that manner. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   And was this on all occasions, on 
the six or seven occasions he would jump out and sprint to 
the front door? 
WITNESS 3:   It happened once. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Only once? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Well, Mr Gigaba denies that he was 
10 
nervous on the one or two occasions that he would have 
gone there during that period or that he ever sprinted out 
of his car.  You do not have to comment, I am just putting 
to you what his version is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am looking at my watch. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I was hoping you would not but I 
understand that you are… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think you may be over by two 
minutes but you can wrap up. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Ja, thank you.  I just want to put to 
20 
you – sorry, quite an important question, just describe the 
bag that you say you saw in Mr Gigaba’s – the boot or 
trunk of his car that had the money you say you saw? 
WITNESS 3:   It was a travel bag, a travelling bag. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   A travel bag.  What do you call a 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 63 of 276 
 
travel bag?  Is that one of those bags on four wheels that 
we see in port and people boarding planes with as part of 
their hand luggage?  I see you are smiling behind the 
mask, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have heard evidence where a 
witness said he had been offered a lot of money in a bag 
and when he was asked to describe the bag he said it is 
like those bag that lawyers carry. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Touché, touché, but you are a lawyer 
too, Chair, in the broader sense. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  You might to repeat your 
question for the witness. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Yes.  I was asking you, witness 3, 
when you say it is a travel bag, just so we can understand, 
is it one of those bags we see people on aeroplanes with 
on – that have normally four wheels and a handle and you 
wheel them onto an aircraft.  If that what you call a travel 
bag? 
WITNESS 3:   That is correct. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   It is different to a sports bag.  Not 
20 
the same thing, do you agree? 
WITNESS 3:   A travel bag. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Sorry, I spoke over you, do you 
agree? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it different from a sports bag, witness 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 64 of 276 
 
3? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, it is different, Chair. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Well, I have got to wrap up but I am 
just going to put the references, we will not go there, to 
save time, but you have described, page 249, line 7 to 8 – 
sorry, that would – let me give the correct reference, Chair.  
That would be SEQ07/21, page 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just say when you say /21, it is 
/2021. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   2021, sorry, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And what page? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Page 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Typed page 120. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   You then – this will just be my last 
submission, you describe it there at line 7 to 8 as the bag 
you saw as a sports bag.  Does chair see it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I can see it.  Do you see it, witness 
3, at page 56, line …[intervenes] 
20 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, I do, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do see it? 
WITNESS 3:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what counsel is putting to you is that 
in your evidence you described the bag as a sports bag but 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 65 of 276 
 
you have today agreed with his – you have agreed when he 
asked you whether the bag you were talking – the travel 
bag is a bag that is different from a sports bag and it is a 
bag that people normally carry when they go to board 
aeroplanes.  That is what he is putting to you.  What do 
you have to say about that? 
WITNESS 3:   Chair, a sports bag, I think I have one 
myself, I travel with that bag, I put my luggage in there as 
well, that is what I am referring to, you travel with that 
sports bag as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must just say counsel I was hesitating 
when you used the example of aeroplanes whether the 
description was clear enough for the witness but I let it go. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   But we have got on record that in his 
words it was different to a sports bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   But we will leave that for you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I just want to say to you that he 
denies he carried large sums of money with him and if on 
occasion he paid for a meal, he may have had some cash 
with him but he certainly was not carrying large sums of 
cash.  You can comment or not but I am just putting that on 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 66 of 276 
 
record, witness 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to say anything to that, 
witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   Thanks, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, is that thanks, you will not 
comment or you would like to comment, witness 3? 
WITNESS 3:   No, I am not commenting, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Chair, bearing in mind the time 
constraints I have more questions but I will defer to the 
10 
Chair now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   As they say in the senate I will yield 
back to Chair.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is alright.  Of course 
there is still the other issue that you will discuss with Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   I will discuss with Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe – we will see how that one is 
resolved. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you very much.  Mr 
Pretorius, counsel for witness 3, do you want to ask some 
questions before he does or shall we allow him to re-
examine? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 67 of 276 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, given the implications of a 
certain line of questioning of my learned friend and certain 
innuendos contained in his questioning, to which I have an 
objection but I will deal with it off the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I need to place certain passages of 
the evidence on record to clarify the situation regarding 
the evidence of number 3, but in the meanwhile I think 
there 
is 
a 
request 
for 
re-examination 
from 
the 
representative of witness 3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you will do that later. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will do that later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  They did not sanitise 
before you came in but they must then sanitise now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So I will wash my hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.   
MR DUBE:   Thank you for the indulgence, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Dube, how much time do you 
think you will take?  I want to see if I am going to limit you.  
MR DUBE:   I should not take long at all, Chair, I think 
20 
there is probably about three issues that I need to clarify 
with the witness, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ten minutes should be fine, 15 
minutes? 
MR DUBE:   I think let us say 15 minutes, Chair. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 68 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR DUBE:   As it may depend on his responses as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Witness 3, your counsel, 
Mr Dube, will now ask you some questions as his re-
examination. 
MR DUBE:   Chair, apologies, I seemed to have lost the 
page that I marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  If you do not find it you will have 
to improvise as counsel. 
MR DUBE:   Certainly, Chair, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR DUBE:   Witness 3, good afternoon. 
WITNESS 3:   Afternoon, sir. 
MR DUBE:   Are you well? 
WITNESS 3:   I am well thanks and you? 
MR DUBE:   I think I am in a better place than you are, so 
certainly thank you for availing yourself to us.  Witness 3, 
the first issue that I would just like you to clarify relates to 
the logbooks and the minister ’s diary.  Can you just clarify 
to the Chairperson, when you refer to logbooks and diary, 
20 
what it is that you are referring to? 
WITNESS 3:   Logbooks, it is a log books that we keep for 
all our trips in our official vehicles and the diary, it is the 
date today, programme of the VIP. 
MR DUBE:   Now let us go to SEQ7/2021 on page 52. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 69 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just move the mic towards you so that 
you do not speak too far away from it. 
MR DUBE:   Thanks, Chair.  Witness 3, let us move to 
SEQ07/2021 on page 52.  Just let me know when you are 
there. 
WITNESS 3:   I am here, thank you. 
MR DUBE:   Alright.  Now there was a lot of questions that 
arose from your evidence in this regard and I think maybe I 
will just read from line 12 on page 116 of the transcript, it 
is page 52, SEQ07/2021 and when I am done reading I 
10 
would just like you to clarify to Mr Chairperson what the 
actual position is with regard to this evidence.  Okay?  So I 
will start on line 8 with Adv Pretorius who says yes and 
paragraph 21.1: 
“And I do not understand your evidence now to be 
this, that none of these visits were recorded in the 
minister ’s diary.  So what was the position?” 
You respond: 
“Okay, normally you will just inform us and when he 
wants us to go, he will inform us to go there. 
20 
So were they or were they not recorded in the 
minister ’s diary?” 
You say: 
“They were not recorded at all.” 
And did you record these trips in the log book of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 70 of 276 
 
your vehicle?” 
You say: 
“He 
informed 
us 
we 
should 
not 
record 
this 
information  on the logbook so we did not.” 
Did he give a reason for telling you not to record 
them in his logbook, in your vehicle logbook? 
No reason was given to us. 
Right.  What types of trips did he say you should 
not record in the logbook, was it trips to particular 
destinations or only trips to a particular destination, 
10 
one destination?” 
And you respond: 
“Only for the – that is in question now, he would say 
we should not record that.” 
And the Chairperson asked: 
“Which address is that?” 
You say – he says: 
“Which 
address 
is 
that, 
is 
that 
the 
Gupta 
residence?” 
You say: 
20 
“Yes, Chair.” 
That was the only – or those are the only trips he 
said you must not record?” 
You say: 
“That is correct, Chair.” 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 71 of 276 
 
Now 
with 
this 
evidence 
in 
mind 
just 
clarify 
to 
Mr 
Chairperson what is the actual position regarding the 
logbooks and the minister ’s diary, were those reported? 
WITNESS 3:    Thank you Chair.   Some of these trips were 
recorded earlier, until the Minister informs me that we 
should not record them, and the logbooks were kept in our 
head office, in the hands of witness one, that is the 
logbook, and on the diary ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes continue. 
WITNESS 3:    Yes Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, or are you done? 
WITNESS 3:    And with the diary, thank you Chair, with the 
diary on the visit to the Saxonwold was not on the diary, 
the Minister will only tell us on the day, that we need to be 
at the Gupta residence, thank you. 
ADV DUBE:   Okay so if I understand you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before you proceed Mr Dube, 
I take it that when you refer to those trips you are referring 
to the trips to the Gupta residence, in your question or did 
you mean all trips? 
20 
ADV DUBE:   The trips to the Gupta residence, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
alright, 
is 
that 
how 
you 
understood the question, witness 3, as well? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 72 of 276 
 
ADV DUBE:   So, witness 3 if I’m to summarise your 
evidence in this regard, you are saying the logbooks, the 
trips were recorded on some occasions until the Minister 
instructed you not to record them and from that point, they 
were no longer recorded but with regards to his diary, the 
trips were never recorded? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct. 
ADV DUBE:   Thank you.  Now, moving onto the next issue 
which relates to the six or seven visits to the Gupta 
residence.  You’ve mentioned that, on one of these trips it 
10 
is you who was driving the Minister? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct. 
ADV DUBE:   And that there was no-one else in the 
vehicle? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s true. 
ADV DUBE:   And it was put to you that, that would be a 
breach of protocol, do you recall that? 
WITNESS 3:    Yes. 
ADV DUBE:   Was this an unusual occurrence for you and 
the Minister to drive together? 
20 
WITNESS 3:    No, I think I did drove the Minister one on 
one on many occasions, sometimes when we go watch 
soccer at the stadium, he would request me to come over 
and I’d take him to the stadium, so driving him alone was 
not the first time. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 73 of 276 
 
ADV DUBE:   But how would that occur if you were only 
meant to be driving the back-up vehicle, can you clarify 
that to Mr Chairperson? 
WITNESS 3:    Okay, on this particular day we were 
knocking off in the afternoon and the Minister said I must 
stay behind, of which, yes, I did, and he went to freshen up 
and after twenty or thirty minutes he came on and he said, 
we need to go somewhere.  We got into the car, as we 
drove then he told me where we need to go.  He said he 
must go to a compound in Saxonwold. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, you say you were knocking off, is 
that correct? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So, did the other protectors leave to go 
to their respective homes, while you remained behind? 
WITNESS 3:    Yes, all of them, they knocked off, I stayed 
behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, you have said that there were a 
number of occasions when you drove the Minister to 
certain places, including when he went to stadium.  Were 
20 
you the only one, of the protectors, that the Minister would, 
from time to time, ask to drive him somewhere without the 
other protectors or did he do the same with regard to other 
protectors?   
WITNESS 3:    I think it was done only to me Chair. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 74 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    You are not aware that he requested 
other 
protectors, individually 
to 
take 
him 
somewhere 
without the other protectors? 
WITNESS 3:    With the others, I never heard of, I only 
know that he would request me the most. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay, Mr Dube? 
ADV DUBE:   Thank you Chair.  Now, witness 3, going back 
to these six or seven incidents, why are you certain that it 
was six or seven times you went to the Gupta residence 
because Mr Gigaba says it was only once or twice? 
10 
WITNESS 3:    Thank you Chair, I think in one occasion I 
took him with his wife, for dinner at the Gupta residence, 
that was – ja, to cover the six or seven times and the other 
time was when I saw Mr Brian Molefe at the compound 
which was a different day and the other day was when I 
saw Mr Matshela Koko and the other day again, I saw Mr 
Ben Ngubane and the other day I saw Ms Linda Mabaso, 
thank you Chair. 
ADV DUBE:   So, you know that it’s six or seven times 
because on different occasions when you were there with 
20 
the Minister you saw different people? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The times that you have specified when 
you saw certain people, doesn’t look like it is six times, 
you said the one time you saw Mr Brian Molefe, that’s one, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 75 of 276 
 
the other time you saw Dr Ben Ngubane the second time, 
the other time you saw Mr Matshela Koko, that’s three the 
other time you saw Ms Linda Mabaso, that’s four.  Was it 
one of these four occasions that you saw the former 
President, Mr Zuma – Zuma’s convoy or was it a separate 
occasion? 
WITNESS 3:    With the convoy was a different occasion, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So that would be five if my calculation 
is correct. 
10 
ADV DUBE:   And  think, Chair, he also mentioned there 
was an occasion where there was a dinner, and he took the 
Minister ’s wife. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, yes, so that might take us to six, 
okay, alright you may continue. 
ADV DUBE:   Thank you witness 3. Witness 3, the 
propositions or what has been put to you is that Mr Gigaba 
denies most if not all of the averments that you have made 
in your statement, he denies that your evidence is true.  
Essentially the inference to be drawn from that is that what 
20 
you have placed before this Commission is a fabrication.  
Now, are you aware of what happened to witness one over 
the weekend?  
WITNESS 3:    Yes, I’m aware…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry, asking whether he’s aware of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 76 of 276 
 
the reports. 
ADV DUBE:   Are you aware of the reports, thank you Mr 
Chair, are you aware of the reports relating to witness one, 
over this weekend? 
WITNESS 3:    Yes, I am aware. 
ADV DUBE:   Now, you’ve also requested that you should 
testify in private, behind camera, is that correct? 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct. 
ADV DUBE:   And part of that was to safeguard your 
identity as you are of the view that your life might be in 
10 
danger. 
WITNESS 3:    That’s correct. 
ADV DUBE:   Now, given all of this knowledge, more so 
regarding the reports about witness one over this weekend, 
why would you put your life further in danger by fabricating 
evidence against the Minister or the former Minister 
Gigaba? 
WITNESS 3:    I think this is a true reflection of what 
transpired while I was serving him in my duties.  All that I 
have said in my testimony is a true reflection of what 
20 
happened in the past. 
ADV DUBE:   Chairperson, thank you, those are all the 
questions I have for witness 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you Mr Dube. 
ADV DUBE:   Thank you. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 77 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    They will sanitise the podium before Mr 
Pretorius goes there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, firstly certain facts put in 
cross-examination need to be kept and we will check, there 
may be some inaccuracies that we need to place before 
you, 
but 
we’ll 
do 
that 
in 
due 
course 
after 
proper…[indistinct 
dropped 
voice]. 
 
Secondly, 
it’s 
unfortunate that my learned friend saw fit to raise the 
issues in the manner that he did without placing the full 
record before you.  We need to place certain matters on 
10 
record. The way the legal team and the investigators work 
with any particular witness is that they form a team, and 
they all work together, sometimes separately but ultimately 
always together as a team.  Where a witness is not 
represented, the statement will be finalised by the team 
and will be, then sworn in an affidavit for presentation 
before you.  Now where the position is different where a 
witness is legally represented and the position in this case, 
as with all other cases where a witness is legally 
represented, the statement is placed before the attorneys, 
20 
they check it, and they give the go-ahead that the affidavit 
can then be sworn.  Now, in relation to this joining the dots 
and the suggestion that this might have been suggested to 
the witness which the witness has denied.  I need to place 
the full text of the relevant evidence on record which I 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 78 of 276 
 
would have hoped my learned friend would have taken the 
trouble to do in fairness but be that as it may. On page 119 
of 152 of the transcript, that’s SEQ07/2021 red number 
page 55, I just want to read the relevant passages. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Onto the record, 
“Advocate Pretorius:  are you able to say where that 
money came from, this is a particular amount of 
money that he said – in evidence he had observed. 
Witness 3:  I could not tell that time but as we make 
10 
some visits, then I could connect the dots to say the 
money came from the Saxonwold residence. 
 
Pretorius:  How can you say that? 
Witness 3:  Because at some point as we went to 
the premises, he would go to the Guptas and we will 
go to Sandton and he would use to pay cash for his 
tailored suit”, 
 
Then there is a number or there are a number of 
passages dealing with the type of bag and the condition in 
which the money was seen to be kept then on page 120 of 
20 
152, that’s SEQ07/2021 56 I come back in questioning to 
the issue of the money and its source, I say, 
“You have just told the Chair of an occasion where 
you saw a bag in the boot of Mr Gigaba’s official 
vehicle and you say Minister Gigaba opened that 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 79 of 276 
 
bag and you could see a stack of R200 notes in that 
bag, right?   
Yes, I say correct, the witness says, 
correct”. 
Then an important passage, I put to the witness the 
following, 
“Right, now I asked you earlier, because your 
statement says nothing in relation to where that bag 
came from.  Are you able to say where that money 
came from through any observation that you made, 
not any opinion that you might have but through any 
10 
observation from what you saw, did you see where 
that bag came from? 
 
Witness 3:  No, I cannot say where it came from 
Chair. 
And I asked the question again, I’m sorry? 
Witness 3:  I cannot tell you where it came from 
Chair. 
And then the questioning goes on but it’s not relevant to 
the point that the witness was properly questioned and 
fairly questioned. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, that part, where I take further 
your questioning may be important, I say I don’t know if 
that’s like six to the witness, that is because you do not 
know how, that is the bag, came to the car, not because 
you do not want to tell us, you do not know how the bag 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 80 of 276 
 
that had money came into the car, is that right, witness 3 
says, yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    That’s a question from yourself. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, that’s a question from me and I say 
yes and the witness repeats, 
 
“That is correct Chair, I do not know. 
Then I say, yes okay and then you say, and nor 
does your statement say where it came from, you 
expressed an opinion earlier but I just want to 
10 
establish that, according to your statement and 
what you say now, you do not know the history of 
that bag and how that money came to be in the bag 
and the bag came to be in the boot of the Minister, 
we are correct and the witness says, that is correct 
Chair”. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, Chair, so I’m not sure of the 
course of my learned friend’s …[indistinct dropped voice], 
thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you, witness 3 I will excuse you 
20 
now, depending on the outcome of the discussions between 
counsel for Mr Gigaba and Mr Pretorius and your counsel, 
it may be that you might be asked to come back some other 
time but for now, thank you very much for availing yourself 
for cross-examination, we appreciate it, you are now 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 81 of 276 
 
excused. 
WITNESS 3:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, you are excused, I think we should 
take about – I’ll take about five minutes or ten minutes 
adjournment before the next witness, is that fine – is ten 
minutes fine? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ten minutes is perfect, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay we’ll take a ten minutes 
adjournment before the next witness, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS

INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson before we start Mr 
Solomon has indicated that he wishes to place something on 
record with your leave if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If there is an opportune time for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.  Let them sanitise 
before you go there Mr Solomon.  Yes Mr Solomon. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Thank you – thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Chair I just wanted to put on record 
one aspect flowing from my questioning that flowed from a 
discussion I had with Mr Pretorius about the connecting of 
the dots and anyone that witnessed that he may have spoken 
to.  There is absolutely no suggestion from either me or my 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 82 of 276 
 
client that Mr Pretorius or any member of this commission 
would have been – would have spoken to him or encouraged 
him to connect any dots and that was not the imputation of 
what my line was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  But now that you are 
there maybe I could check where the – whether you and I are 
on the same page on this that the time that I allowed you for 
cross-examination would have been more or less about an 
10 
hour, is that your assessment as well? 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  I – yes I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think it started about twenty five to 
eleven. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  I think it was about an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Then there was a fifteen minutes tea 
break. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think you stopped about ten to or five 
to twelve or thereabouts if I am not mistaken. 
20 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Maybe you owe me five minutes but we 
can talk about that some time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 2 you did say there were some 
questions you would have liked to ask but I take it that  you 
did not think that they were necessarily crucial? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 83 of 276 
 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Chair I have been – I am guided by the 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  I am not – I am not complaining that 
we could not do what we needed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SOLOMON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay thank you.  
Okay your next witness is Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this time he would be testifying in 
regard to matters relating to Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Welcome back Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Your Counsel is here – your 
legal representative is that right?  Okay if you can place 
yourself on record from that side that would be fine. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
20 
ADV MOTSEPE:  My name is Clifford Motsepe I am with 
Advocate Sikhakhane and Mpho Molefe.  We are duly 
instructed Molaba Attorneys on behalf of Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   We just want to put it on record today 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 84 of 276 
 
Chair that we are not going to make any statements.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you are not going to? 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Mr Molefe has not prepared any statement 
for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am not sure I think your voice is 
soft.  He is not going to read any statement – make any 
statement? 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Yes he has not prepared any statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I know that last week he said he 
10 
would like to make a statement I said well we will see when 
he comes back for Transnet but this time I was going to be 
careful to make sure that we check whether he implicates 
anybody before I allow him to just read his statement.  But if 
he is not going to make any that is fine. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Then I think the Registrar can 
administer the oath or affirmation again. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR MOLEFE:  Brian Molefe. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  
Do 
have 
any objection to making the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR MOLEFE:  I have no objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 85 of 276 
 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, I truly 
affirm. 
MR MOLEFE:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to – for the benefit of the 
public to just give … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Certainly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  An idea to the public what matters will be 
covered by Mr Molefe’s evidence. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  The matters that will be covered 
by Mr Molefe’s evidence broadly Mr Chairperson are those 
set out in the summons and by and large we will be dealing 
with the issue of the McKinsey and Regiments contracts.   
 
We will be dealing with issues relating to the 
acquisition 
of 
locomotives 
– 
95 
locomotives; 
100 
locomotives, 
1064 
locomotives. 
 
That 
really 
lies 
fundamentally at the heart of our questioning of Mr Molefe. 
20 
 
There of course are a number of introductory things 
that we need to deal with but much of the evidence will 
revolve around McKinsey, Regiments and the locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson the two exhibits that 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 86 of 276 
 
are of particular relevance are Exhibit 22 which you will find 
in Bundle 5 that is being produced for this hearing and then 
Exhibit 27.  Exhibit 22 is Mr Molefe’s Transnet exhibit.  
Exhibit 27 is a so called POI Bundle which has documents in 
it that are common to the witnesses that we intend to lead 
and deal with this week being Mr Molefe, Mr Gama and Mr 
Gigaba and Mr Singh. 
 
Mr Molefe you have in front of you Exhibit 22? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you please… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess we start with the bundle.  Do you 
have Transnet Bundle 5?  You look at the spine of the bundle 
to see whether it is Bundle 5 – 05.  
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got it? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I think you can go to the exhibit 
Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  If I could take you then 
please to page 28 and there you will find an affidavit.  You 
20 
have been here I know many times so when we refer to page 
numbers we are referring to the black numbers on the left 
hand side.  I just would ask you to confirm Mr Molefe that 
this is an affidavit that you deposed to it runs from  page 28 
to 51 and it was deposed to it appears on the 20t h January 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 87 of 276 
 
2021 containing a series of annexures running up until page 
114.  Would you confirm that that is your affidavit and that 
you have deposed to it as reflected here? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is indeed Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And would you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of that affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes it is so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson might I ask you then to 
enter into evidence Mr Molefe’s affidavit dated the 20t h of 
January 2021 as Exhibit BB22.3? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Brian Molefe that starts 
at page 28 is together with its annexures admitted as an 
exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit BB22.3. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then Mr Chairperson as I have 
mentioned the other relevant exhibit is Exhibit BB27 found in 
Bundle 6.  That contains a series of investigation reports I 
do not know if – if Chair you want to admit the bundle now or 
it is admitted as we – we deal with the reports when dealing 
with Mr Molefe’s evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did we talk about how it would be dealt 
20 
with – okay your – the bundle is part of Bundle 06 and then  
you reflect your exhibit BB27 but when you say BB27 you are 
talking about all the documents that are in the bundle, is that 
correct? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I think it might be more 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 88 of 276 
 
appropriate then Chair that I deal with it and I ask you to 
introduce the bundle when we come to the particular 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you would prefer that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes we might have to do that because I am a 
little uneasy about saying all the documents are… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That are… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are Exhibit BB27. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe that we will have Exhibit 
BB27.1 next – 27.1. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  27.2 as we go along. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Chair if I may ask a question?  I see in those 
investigation reports some of them have a heading called 
Findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  I just wonder as a layman what the meaning 
of findings (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you mean for example in the Fundundzi 
Report? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no in the commission’s report. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 89 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  With – well the commission has not made 
any report.  What – take me to the bundle and the page that 
you have in mind? 
MR MOLEFE:  I think we will deal with them when we get to 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in case you have any concerns the 
10 
commission has not made any findings I certainly have not 
made any findings. 
MR MOLEFE:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe I am not going to take you 
through your – your statement in the order in which it is – it 
appears.  I am going to ask you some general questions and 
then more specific questions where you do in your affidavit 
deal with topics that I am going to touch on – I will take you 
there insofar as is necessary. 
20 
 
You will understand and appreciate I am sure that 
Transnet is a different stream to the Eskom stream and there 
are some things that I need to revisit.  I know you have given 
evidence about them before but I am going to try in dealing 
for example with your personal details and predictions as to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 90 of 276 
 
your appointments which are relevant for our purposes but I 
will try and summarise and roll those up so as not to waste 
time. 
 
In relation to your personal details we know that you 
worked in the Premier’s office in Limpopo then you had a 
stint in National Treasury; you held a number of very senior 
positions.  You then of course were the CEO of the PIC from 
June 2003 to July 2010 and then in April of 2011 you became 
the GCE of Transnet.  Would you confirm that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes indeed it is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was is it not April… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  April – I beg your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it was February. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  February I beg your pardon. 
MR MOLEFE:  I think that was February Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  February of 2011. 
MR MOLEFE:  April was the – April was Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Group CEO of Transnet was February 
20 
2011. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes and I – I have – where I misread 
my notes is that you held that position until April 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So it started in February. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 91 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Of 2011 until April 2015 I am indebted 
to 
you 
Chairperson. 
 
So 
that 
was 
for 
a 
period 
of 
approximately four years Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  No it was for a period of over five years. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  Because when I went to Eskom I was just 
seconded. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  So I kept my position at Transnet and I was 
10 
just seconded to Eskom. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And I was going to come to that so you 
were seconded to Eskom that – that is in the April 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:  yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As you mentioned, alright.  And you 
remained at Eskom as I understand it until December of 
2016, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  And then we also know that you 
had a short stint as a member of Parliament and I am not 
20 
going to – to deal with that.   
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now so far as your – your educational 
qualifications are listed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that Mr Myburgh.  You – you 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 92 of 276 
 
just made a point – you just made the point that when you 
went to Eskom in April 2015 that was under secondment.  
The secondment did not last your entire time when you were 
at Eskom is it not? 
MR MOLEFE:  No, no sorry Chair.  Yes it lasted until 
September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Sorry, sorry it does not make it five years it 
makes it four years and maybe nine months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some months. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so as long as you were under 
secondment at Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You remained an employee of Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes in fact my salary into my bank account 
was paid by Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
MR MOLEFE:  And Transnet was reimbursed by Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But then you were appointed 
20 
permanently by Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In September. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 93 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And once you were appointed permanently 
so to speak you ceased to be an employee of Transnet and 
became an employee of Eskom, is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chair.  Now so far as your academic 
qualifications are concerned I understand that you – you 
have an array of degrees and I supposed we need no go 
through all of them but from what I understand you have a 
10 
B.Com from Unisa, a Masters in Business Leadership from 
Unisa and you have amongst other things an Honorary 
Doctorate in Engineering from the Glasgow Caledonian 
University, is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  That is correct.  That is an Honorary 
Doctorate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  You have other Honorary 
Doctorates? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I do not have any other Honorary 
Doctorates. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So I suppose Mr Molefe given your 
qualifications and experience you were really ideally placed 
to detect any form of corruption whilst you were the GCE of 
Transnet. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I cannot say that with certainty Chair.  The 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 94 of 276 
 
fact that you are qualified does not make you a corruption 
detective. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does not make you? 
MR MOLEFE:  A – a detector of corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MOLEFE:  A corruption detection machine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you say you did not have then the 
necessary skills. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not say that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Or experience within which to detect 
corruption. 
MR MOLEFE:  No, I did not say so Chair.  I did not express 
an opinion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  I just say that I was definitely not a corruption 
detection machine and that does not mean that if I saw 
corruption I could not see – I could not understand it or I was 
incapable of understanding and so it is not a – you are able 
20 
or unable. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  So I am just saying that I am not a specialist 
corruption detection machine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 95 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  As you might be. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I accept that you were not a specialist 
corruption detection machine did you detect any corruption 
while you were the GCE of Transnet? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes there were incidents where there was 
issues of discipline, maybe corruption.  It is just that now 
that you ask me.  But I do remember once or twice there was 
an issue relating to somebody who was security personnel at 
TFR that had been involved in issues of discipline maybe 
you could even say it was corruption but that we dealt with 
10 
and several incidents.  It is just that they were not a subject 
of this commission. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Oh sorry. 
MR MOLEFE:  I never went back to – to refresh my memory 
but there were issues discipline that we dealt with while I 
was there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you have been asked about the 
New Age prediction. 
MR MOLEFE:  The? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The New Age prediction of your 
20 
appointment as GCE of Transnet.  As I understand it though 
you have not previously been actually shown the newspaper 
article.  Could I ask you to go to Exhibit 22 which you have 
in front of you and could you please turn to page 401?  Mr 
Molefe it is Exhibit 22.   So it is your exhibit at page 401.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 96 of 276 
 
Alright you see… 
CHAIRPERSON:  My 401 is a media statement released at 
the Chairperson’s instance on Wednesday night December 
2020. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think that you may be in the wrong 
exhibit or divider Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the – okay no I am terribly sorry.  I 
made the mistake of looking at the red numbers. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instead of looking at the red numbers so 
10 
you were... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  401 I beg your pardon – the black 
numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the black numbers.  I have got the – I 
have got it ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So Mr Molefe you will see that  
that was a newspaper report it was published on the 7t h of 
December 2010, do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I take it you would not dispute 
20 
that the first publication of the New Age actually happened 
the day before. 
MR MOLEFE:  Come again. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The first publication of the New Age 
was on the 6t h of December 2010 this was the second day of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 97 of 276 
 
the existence of this newspaper. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I do not know that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  And we do know that the New 
Age was Gupta owned, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes I am not sure of the ownership structure 
of the New Age. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And … 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what – what this says is that 
former Public Investment Corporation PIC Chief Executive 
10 
Officer Brian Molefe is said to take over as Transnet boss 
and then 1,2,3, 4 paragraphs below that the New Age has it 
on good authority that Molefe will be appointed CEO of the 
board, you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now as I understand it you say that 
you – you knew nothing about this? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not know anything about this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But it was brought to your attention at 
the time. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Interestingly Chair when I went to check I was 
in fact oversees in New York at the time when this published 
and by the – by the date of this newspaper article I had 
actually been there for a few days maybe over a week.  It 
was at the tail end of my trip to – to the United States. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 98 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I think perhaps I can just cut 
through my questioning by asking you to look at the bottom 
of the article.  Contacted for comment Molefe says I have not 
been informed I do not know anything about it.  Were you 
contacted at the time? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  I was overseas and I think I got a message on 
my phone that said,  do you know anything about the – you 
going to be appointed at Transnet CEO?  And that was my 
10 
response.  I have not been informed, I do not know anything 
about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the message come from (inaudible0. 
MR MOLEFE:   I think it came from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the 00:22:57) newspaper. 
MR MOLEFE:  Journalist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  Perhaps one of these journalists.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  But I just remember just seeing a message 
20 
that says that the – do you know that you are just – you are 
going to be appointed CEO of Transnet?  And I said no I do 
not know anything about and I have not been informed by 
anyone. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Molefe would you – I mean you 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 99 of 276 
 
have said that you do not know anything about this; you 
cannot explain it.  I mean do you think it was a lucky guess 
on the part of the New Age while speculation – how do you 
think it came about?  You no doubt would have reflected 
carefully on it when you get a phone like you did and you 
were asked to comment about your testimony. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not reflect carefully about it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did not? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask them where you do get this 
from? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not.  I – Chairperson even now I get 
all sorts of questions about – from the media about the – all 
sorts of incidents that I do now know anything about and my 
answer is very short I do not know, I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  There has been lots of incidents if you go 
through the media where I had no comment to make because 
in fact the media was wrong and there was nothing like that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But what I am really getting at is once 
you were appointed as the Transnet GCE did you surely must 
20 
have reflected back and thought well hell someone knew 
something that I did not know. 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC: You must have but how is that possible 
I mean it seems so natural and obvious. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 100 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Why – why is it difficult for you to 00:24:39 
that I could not have taken that article seriously and I did 
not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And what Counsel is saying Mr Molefe is 
maybe you may be forgiven for not having not – for not 
having taken it seriously when they sent you a message and 
said do you know that you are – you are going to be 
appointed CEO of Transnet.  But once it happened. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Then 
it 
happened 
only 
about 
what 
two/three months – two months after … 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the article. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is saying surely at that stage you must 
have thought so it means these people knew what they were 
talking about so I should have taken them seriously.  That is 
what he is saying, what do you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not think about it – I did not… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did not connect the article. 
MR MOLEFE:  I did not stress – I did not stress about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the appointment. 
MR MOLEFE:  Come again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not connect the article and the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 101 of 276 
 
appointment? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not Chair.  I – actually I had surely 
even forgotten about the article because it is something that 
happened; I was literally in New York and I got to hear that 
they say that I am going to be appointed Transnet CEO; I did 
not know anything about it.  Nobody had said anything to me 
about it and I did not know anything about it and I dismissed 
it.  And – and then later on I – I did not link the article to my 
appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you unemployed at the time of the 
10 
article? 
MR MOLEFE:  I was in fact at the time of the article in the – 
I was called up to the SANDF at the time of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean you were employed or 
does that mean you were not employed? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is a – I am a reserve so I cannot say I was 
unemployed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  But I was called up as a reserve and at the 
same time I had been doing some transactions with Investec 
20 
Bank which is what I was doing (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes how long had it been since you had 
left PIC, do you remember? 
MR MOLEFE:  Maybe six months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About six months. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 102 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be correct to say – okay maybe I 
should not put this.  During that six months were you 
unemployed until you were called on the SANDF? 
MR MOLEFE:  Unemployed I was not looking for a job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not looking for a job. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja so that is a definition of unemployment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  When you looking for a job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  And you not doing – I was not looking for job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:  There are some transactions that I had been 
doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  With the Investec Bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  And at the on – at this particular time I was in 
fact on callout at the SANDF. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So this was maybe about two or three weeks  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was SANDF employment? 
MR MOLEFE:  No it is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not employment? 
MR MOLEFE:  It is reserves yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 103 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but would it be correct to say you 
were not employed during the six months? 
MR MOLEFE:  I was not employed by anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you were self-employed? 
MR MOLEFE:  In a sense because – because I – yes I was 
not employed by anyone. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Just sticking 
with the New Age of course under your watch as GCE 
Transnet then went on to sponsor the New Age big interview, 
correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  One of the topics that we will come to.  
So that is on the 7t h of December now I do not know if you 
this but you were actually nominated for the position of GCE 
by Mr Iqbal Sharma you know that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  No I did not know that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can you turn to page 400 please just a 
page before that article – page before.  That email 13 t h of 
January sent to Leaders Limited they were the head hunters.  
You will remember that you made reference to them when 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 104 of 276 
 
giving evidence in the Transnet stream and it says: 
“Dear Mr Khumalo” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean in the Eskom? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon in the Eskom steam.  
It says: 
“Dear Mr Khumalo I would like to nominate Mr Brian Molefe 
to be considered as a candidate for the Group Chief 
Executive position at Transnet.” 
Is this the first time that you had come to learn that Mr 
Sharma nominated you? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  I came to know about it in the context of 
getting these documents but not until now did I know and I 
now I mean when do you have…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you got the bundles. 
MR MOLEFE:  When the bundle was made available yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When the bundle was made available. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  I do not know what this happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   My recollection is that Mr Khumalo, Brian - 
I think it was Brian Khumalo – called me could sometime, I 
20 
think, in January and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   January 2011? 
MR MOLEFE:   2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just important to mention the 
years because we deal with different years.   
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 105 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  January 2011, you say Mr Brian 
Khumalo called you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Called me and said that Transnet has been 
looking for a Group Chief Executive and they have 
appointed him as the head-hunter.  Mr Brian Khumalo was 
the 
head-hunter. 
 
In 
fact, 
he 
tried 
to 
head 
hunt 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   He was from ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I think he ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Leaders Unlimited? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   So he called me and said:  I have this 
mandate to look for a Group Chief Executive Officer.  
Would you be interested.  And I said:  Let me think about 
it.  And I... forgot it.   
 
He says:  Ja, would you be interested?  And I 
said:  Let me think about it.  And I must have thought about 
it.  For about a day or two and then I called him back and I 
20 
said:  Okay let us give it a shot.  And he said:  Okay 
submit your CV to me.   
 
And then I sent my CV to him.  And then, as I 
say in my affidavit, he then called me after a few days to 
arrange an interview with members of the Transnet Board. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 106 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think maybe you should stop 
there because ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Advocate Myburgh knows how he 
wants to... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, I see that it is just 
past one o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I take it that you would like to take 
the lunch adjournment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment 
and we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS FOR THE LUNCH BREAK 
INQUIRY RESUMES AFTER THE LUNCH BREAK 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC 
(RESUMES):   
Chairperson.  Mr Molefe, we were dealing with your 
appointment and we have got to the 13 t h of January where 
I have showed you a document reflecting that Mr Sharma 
had nominated you.  We know, as you have said, that you 
20 
then went for an interview.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you would have noticed Mr 
Sharma as a member of the selection panel? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 107 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now are you aware of the fact that 
Mr Sharma had some business interest together with 
Mr Essa? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you have read about that, have 
you not, in the documents that you have been provided 
with? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, recently.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  There is reference there in one 
of the money flow reports and we will come to that in time.  
10 
Reference is made to the fact that Mr Sharma and Mr Essa 
worked together, at least in 2021, at a company called ISA 
Capital.  You have read that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I have seen it in the documents.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now just to continue the 
chronology before I move to another topic.  That is in 
January of 2011.  What we know is that in May of 2011, not 
long after that, you might have read about Mr Gigaba, the 
then Minister Gigaba, seeking to replace Mr Mkwanazi, the 
chairperson with Mr Sharma as the chairperson.  Have you 
20 
read about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   No.  No, I have not seen that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we will deal with that Mr 
Gigaba.  And Cabinet refused that attempt to make 
Mr Sharma the chairperson. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 108 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Of Transnet? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I was not aware of that, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  But what you would be 
aware of is that a year or so later in August of 2012, 
Mr Sharma was appointed, was he not, as the chairperson 
of the BABC? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us then deal with your 
appointment as the CEO of Eskom also having been 
10 
predicted.  Now I am aware that you have been asked 
questions about this but of course Mr Bester was a 
Transnet stream witness. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you remember his evidence was 
that he went to a meeting with Mr Essa at JB’s Corner in 
Melrose Arch sometime between, I think, it was May and 
November of 2014. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it was at that meeting that 
20 
Mr Essa told Mr Bester and I quote: 
“They... [you assume that was the Gupta’s] 
...had already decided that the new boss of 
Eskom 
will 
be 
Mr 
Molefe 
and 
that 
an 
announcement in the newspapers soon...” 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 109 of 276 
 
 
You have again, as I understand, testified that 
you do not know where or know anything about that.  Is 
that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know anything about that and in 
addition to that, I do not know Mr Essa.  I have never met 
Mr Essa. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you did not need to meet 
Mr Essa.   
MR MOLEFE:   I did not even know who he was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Mr Essa was a Gupta 
10 
lieutenant as he is being described in regard to make 
contact with people like Mr Bester.  He did not – so the 
Gupta’s did not need to make contact with you through 
Mr Essa, Mr Molefe.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The Gupta’s did not need to make 
contact with you through Mr Essa ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...to...  you were a longstanding 
associate of theirs.  Correct? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not meet Mr Essa.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   So I did not know Mr Essa.  That is all I am 
saying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you could perhaps just deal with 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 110 of 276 
 
my proposition.  The Gupta’s did not need to send 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know what the Gupta’s needed to 
do or did not need to do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let us explore the role of 
Mr Essa.  Two examples come to mind.  And you will see 
as I go through your evidence, it is really punctuated with 
Mr Essa.  Let me give you two examples of where Mr Essa 
pops up.  One here in this meeting with Mr Bester, right.  
And where he also pops up is Mr Gama gives evidence that 
10 
he sees Mr Essa in Mr Singh’s office.  He says in the latter 
part of 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Where?  Transnet? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, at Transnet.  And he goes in 
and Essa says to him:  I like to meet with you.  And he 
says to him:  Well, you can get my details from Mr Singh.   
 
And in time, Mr Essa contacts Mr Gama and sets 
up a meeting.  Mr Gama says, unknown to him, that 
meeting is set up at what turns out to be the Gupta 
compound.  That is what Mr Essa was doing.   
20 
 
But the Gupta’s did not need to send Mr Essa to 
meet with you.  You knew them.  You were dealing with the 
generals, effectively.  You did not need to deal with the 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I have testified that I knew them. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 111 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Sorry.  Can you just deal with 
my proposition?  It is not surprising that Mr Essa was not 
deployed to meet with you because you were dealing with 
the Gupta’s directly. 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
No, 
I 
cannot 
comment 
on 
what 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...Mr Essa was deployed to do or not 
deployed to do but I did not know Mr Essa.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Well, Mr Molefe, when 
counsel puts to you the proposition that he puts to you, he 
is giving you an opportunity to dispute his proposition.  To 
say that it is incorrect or to say it is correct.  Or if you 
think it is based on a false or premise say that because 
later on, that proposition may be relied upon in the 
assessment of all the evidence.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am just making sure that when you 
20 
decide not to say anything, you know what the implications 
are.  That is all I am ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but all I am saying Chair is that he 
says that the Gupta’s never sent Essa to meet with me.  
There is no way that I can know that. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 112 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he is not saying that.  He is saying 
to you.  If they wanted to talk to you, that is the Gupta’s 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...there would have been no need for 
them to send Mr Essa or anybody. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Because 
they 
were 
having 
direct 
interactions with you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he is saying.  You agree 
with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes.  They ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, there was a need to talk to me, they 
could have spoken to me because I knew them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is what he is saying.  Ja.  
Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I misrepresented what you were 
20 
saying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, not at all and I think you 
correctly 
summarised 
it. 
 
Thank 
you 
Chairperson.  
Mr Molefe, so is this just another coincidence then?  I 
mean, there is a prediction that you are going to become 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 113 of 276 
 
the GC of Transnet.  That turns out correct.  Here you told 
or there is a piece of evidence that Mr Essa tells Mr Bester 
that you are going to become the next CEO of Eskom and 
that happens.  Do you just talk that down to a coincidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Perhaps. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A coincidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Perhaps a coincidence.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So when you first ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I really cannot comment on it.  I do not 
know if it was a coincidence.  I do not know what it was. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you say ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   But it is something that I am not aware.  I 
am not...  I cannot comment on it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you say you cannot comment, 
do you mean that you really cannot or you do not want to? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I want to engage you about 
this.  So presumable when you...  When did you first here 
this 
quite 
riveting 
evidence, 
shocking 
evidence 
by 
Mr Bester?  When did you first hear of it?   
20 
MR MOLEFE:   By Mr Bester? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  It was clear before the 
Commission and he gave this evidence that Mr Essa told 
him between May and November 2014 that you would 
become the new CEO of Transnet.  Where did you first 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 114 of 276 
 
hear of that evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Eskom. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon.  Of Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   Of Eskom? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know.  Perhaps when Mr Bester 
came here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   When Mr Bester came here, yes.  Or when I 
got the documents.  I am not sure.  The Eskom documents.   
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it must have surprised you? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I did not ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No? 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not – I was not surprised. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Nor was I moved at all. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was just something that he said there 
that I did not think anything about.  I just thought, you 
know, these people talk about you all the time.  I did not – 
20 
I was not shocked or surprised. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I have people talking about me all the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
MR MOLEFE:   I have journalists and newspapers saying 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 115 of 276 
 
things that are pitifully wrong.  That I do not take to head 
anymore.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But this is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   So when I do hear rumours about myself, I 
– they just do not enter my existence.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Molefe, we are going to 
spend a long time together, it seems. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am sorry to ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But and it is not ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I am ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is not a bad thing. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am sorry to disappoint you then. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no.  No, you do not. 
MR MOLEFE:   But ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You can assist me but ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   But your expectation for me to be surprised 
does not materialise. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps if you could just bear with 
me and allow me to answer – or ask my question.  Are you 
seriously saying that when you heard that Mr Essa had 
20 
said this that that did not surprise you or concern you at 
all?  That is really my question.  Yes or no? 
MR MOLEFE:   But I do not know who Mr Essa is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  Well, you do know of 
Mr Essa’s links with the Gupta’s? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 116 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, now I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And you know it at the time 
that Mr Bester gave evidence.  That is why I am trying to 
press you.  It must have been of concern to you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Would you rather that it was of concern to 
me? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want you to answer the 
question. 
MR MOLEFE:   I answered the question.  I said it was not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Molefe at the time that 
Mr Bester gave evidence, even if in 2011 or 2015 you did 
not know of his links with the Gupta’s, certainly at the time 
that Mr Bester gave his evidence before the Commission, 
you knew of or had heard.   
 
You 
were 
aware 
of 
all 
the 
allegations 
of 
corruption associated with the Gupta’s and you would have 
heard that he was said to have been an associate of the 
Gupta’s.  And you would have been aware that the 
allegations, and there has been evidence, that he had been 
20 
mentioned in a number of instances associated with 
allegations of state capture and corruption.  Is it not? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chair but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 117 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, before you proceed. You 
would have been aware.  Being aware of that, I would have 
expected that if, when Mr Bester gave evidence he said 
that Mr Essa had told you in 2014 that you would be the 
next boss of Eskom and indeed the following year you did 
become the next boss of Eskom.  I would have expected 
you to be quite concern.   
 
How could Mr Essa who is associated with all 
kinds of – who is associated with all kinds of allegations of 
corruption and state capture, have said he and whoever 
10 
else, they have decided that I would be the next boss of 
Eskom.   
 
And you did then become the next boss of 
Eskom.  I would have expected you to be concerned.  To 
say:  Were there people who were using my name here to 
put me in situations that were compromising?   
 
I would have expected you to be concerned 
about that.  What do you say about that?  Is my 
expectation 
– 
would 
my 
expectations 
have 
been 
unjustified? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You think I should have expected 
that you would have no problem with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, can I explain this?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 118 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Firstly, Mr Bester heard from somebody. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat that sentence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Bester heard from somebody.  He says 
he was told by somebody that I would become CEO of 
Eskom ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  He said he heard from 
Mr Essa ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...I am saying it is Mr Salim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  He was told by Mr Salim Essa. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was his evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, he was told by somebody there where 
they were in a restaurant in one evening.  His... partner... 
Mr Essa.  It happened to Mr Essa, told him that I would 
become CEO of Eskom.  Number one.  So he heard it from 
somebody.  He does not have personal knowledge of it.  
Number one.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Essa may have had personal 
knowledge of it. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no.  They...  But we do not know that.  
20 
Mr Essa ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he told him and it did happen. 
MR MOLEFE:   No.  Chairperson, please allow me to finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will allow you but I just want you to 
understand ...[intervenes]  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 119 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Where you are coming from? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because I am interested in your 
explanation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Yes, but I am trying to tell you where 
I am coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Secondly.  The person that Mr Bester is 
talking about ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe complete your firstly, so I make 
sure I have heard all of it.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   So the first one is, it was hearsay.  
Mr Bester heard it from somebody that he was having 
dinner with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was hearsay.  He heard it – it was 
gossip, it was hearsay.  He heard it there while they were 
having dinner in my absence.  Secondly.  The person that 
he is talking about I have never met.  I have never met 
him.  I, actually, do not know him.  Why would something 
that was said by somebody that I do not know worry me?  
20 
Why would it worry me?   
 
And the fact that it eventually happened.  I know 
how it happened.  I know that I was approached by the 
Minster, not Mr Essa.  I do not know if the Minister has a 
link with Mr Essa but I know it actually eventually 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 120 of 276 
 
happened.   
 
And in my knowledge of how it happened, there 
is no discussion with Bester and Essa.  There is no – they 
do not feature anywhere.  That is something – that is like a 
random event that happened there which this Commission 
is now trying to elevate to an event of significance.   
 
But in my head, it was between Mr Bester...  I, 
actually, do not even – I am not even an acquaintance of 
Mr Bester.  I just know him from his – that he was a 
manager there at the Eskom.   
10 
 
So Mr Bester who is not even acquitted with me, 
has a discussion with somebody that I do not know.  And 
that is suppose to worry me?  No, it does not.  It is 
something that happened there that I do not know anything 
about.   
 
I know how I got to be appointed at Eskom.  I 
can account about how I got to be appointed to Eskom and 
it has got nothing to do with people that I do not know.  
That is why it does not worry me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you do not know if it has anything 
20 
to do with people that you do not know.  All you know is 
that the Minister approved you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not know whether the 
Minister might have had some discussion with either 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 121 of 276 
 
Mr Essa or the Gupta’s.  That you – that at least you would 
say to me you do not know this.  All you know is, the 
Minister approved you.   
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, I just want to...  There is a 
guy who dished up a salad for me.  I do not know that guy.  
He might actually, as I was walking in, have said to the guy 
next to him:  This is Brian Molefe.  Must that worry me 
Chairperson?  Or must I get worried about who that person 
knows that I might know or...   
 
I mean, I cannot live my life like that, seeing 
10 
ghosts or seeing shadows everywhere.  When Mr Bester 
walks in, I mean, this is the man who had a dinner with 
somebody that I do not know and they talked about me and 
they said I will be appointed at Eskom and I am supposed 
to shiver and worry about that and stress about it.  I had 
Chairperson...  No.  There are things to worry about.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And this would not be one of them. 
MR MOLEFE:   This was not one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am going to make one or two – 
say one or two things and then Mr Myburgh will continue.  
20 
On my logic, if it is true that you had never met Mr Essa 
and you did not know him ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I would expect that that should worry 
you more than it should have if you knew him.  The fact 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 122 of 276 
 
that, particularly, when it did happen, you know, I mean – 
or rather when you bear in mind that you are told that he 
said in 2014 that they had decided that you would be the 
next boss of Eskom and then you know as Mr Bester is 
giving evidence that indeed the following year it did 
happen.   
 
I would – my logic says if it was somebody that 
you knew maybe you might not be concerned because you 
know the person.  But if it is somebody that you did not 
know, my logic says, it should worry you more to say:  How 
10 
can somebody that I did not even know that I had never 
met know so much about me even what position I was 
going to hold the following year.  That that would be my 
expectation.  But I think ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you have made your point.   
MR MOLEFE:   Maybe Chairperson, unlike you and 
Mr Myburgh I am not a good conspiracy theorist.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you are getting a chance.  You are 
saying it is conspiracy theories.  You are getting a chance 
20 
to influence my thinking.  You see?  I am saying to myself.  
Mr Essa...   
 
I am saying to myself.  A newspaper belonging to 
the Gupta’s said on the 7 t h of December 2010 that they had 
on good authority that you would be appointed as Group 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 123 of 276 
 
CEO of Transnet.  That was December 7 t h.  January 7, 
February 7, mid-February and 11 or 12 t h, thereabout, I am 
not sure, you get appointed as Group CEO of Eskom... of 
Transnet.  That worries me.  How did they know?  How did 
they get it so right?   
 
You say it does not worry you.  It did not worry 
you at the time.  Then I know hear evidence that somebody 
who was – who has accepted, in terms of the evidence that 
has been led, to have been a Gupta associates, tells 
somebody in 2014 in a meeting that we are very powerful.   
10 
 
We have decided that Mr Brian Molefe is going 
to be the next boss of Eskom.  And it happens the following 
year.  I do not see how I should not be wanting to find out 
how was that possible, particularly, when you tell me you 
did not know Mr Essa.  So.   
 
But the opportunity is for you to put your 
perspective, put your side of the story, so that all of this 
can be taken into account in the assessment of the 
evidence.   
MR MOLEFE:   So Chairperson, if it was you, you would 
20 
have been worried?   
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have been worried? 
MR MOLEFE:   And then what?   
CHAIRPERSON:   Investigate?  Who is this person?  
Where does he get this from?  Mr Myburgh.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 124 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   I am afraid, if you were in my position you 
would have been investigating every day.  You would have 
spend your life just pursuing rabbit holes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR MOLEFE:   That are going nowhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We might be different Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You...  But I am giving you the benefit of 
how I would have dealt with the matter and you are free 
and you might influence me to change my mind about that.  
10 
You might say:  Look, I am different.  This is how I dealt 
with things and I dealt with it in this way because of A, B, 
C, D which you have said.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, I assume 
that what must have concerned you though is when you 
came to learn of the context in which your name was used 
by Mr Essa. 
MR MOLEFE:   What is your assumption? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, what Mr Bester said is not an 
assumption. 
MR MOLEFE:   No ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Bester ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, you started your sentence by saying 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 125 of 276 
 
you assume.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Bester said that Mr Essa referred 
to you and knew all about you and they knew you were 
going to become the next CEO of Eskom but it was in the 
context of him attempting to put pressure on Mr Bester to 
appointed Essa’s business as a supplier development 
partner.  Now when you heard that, that must have 
concerned you.   
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, Mr Bester never approached 
me with this hearsay evidence. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am asking you, when you heard 
this in the Commission, it must have ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   In the Commission?  Now recently? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   There was no reason to be concerned.  It 
was...  it happened in the past.  Perhaps maybe if 
Mr Bester had come to me and said to me I heard from 
Mr Essa that you are going to be the next CEO, maybe I 
would have been concerned.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, Mr ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   But it comes out in the context of the 
Commission.  The it is hearsay.  And I expect that the 
Commission will test the veracity but that is not my job.  
Where I am now, what Mr Bester was saying he heard a 
few years ago, is not something that concerned me.   
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 126 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe, Mr Essa was engaging in 
corrupt activity using your name.  Can you be quoted and 
say when you heard that it just did not concern you?  And 
then let us move to the next topic. 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It did not concern you.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, if you say Mr Essa was engaged in 
corrupt in activity using my name, is that what you are 
found? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of course, it would concern you.  
10 
Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No?  Well, I am not going to carry on 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Molefe.  I want to make 
sure I heard it clearly.  Are you saying if somebody – if you 
– if somebody testified under oath ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and the gist of – part of his evidence 
was that somebody was using your name to advance 
20 
corruption or his corrupt activities.  That would not concern 
you? 
MR MOLEFE:   But I do not know that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is so, does it – for you, does it 
matter that you know or you do not know the person? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 127 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No, it will concern me if I was also involved 
in some kind of activity that is corrupt and so on and so 
forth.  Maybe I would have been concerned.  But when I 
knew that this person was just – people do this all the 
time.   
 
Chairperson, I can give you an example.  People 
will say to somebody, and it has happened to me, I know 
Mr Molefe and I can arrange a meeting with you but you 
must pay me twenty thousand.  And the person pays twenty 
thousand.   
10 
 
And the person comes to me and says that:  
Look, you have to meet so and so.  They have got a good 
project and what have you and so on.  And then I agreed to 
meet them.  But I do not know that this person is actually 
being paid to organise the meeting and I discovered later 
that that guy actually paid this one to organise a meeting 
with me.   
 
Well, firstly, I was not part of the deal.  That is 
why it does not worry me.  I was not part of the deal.  I just 
think:  Eish, it is unfortunate and people do these 
20 
unfortunate things and they use my name to make money 
for themselves and so on.  But I it is not something that my 
life has to stop about.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must confess.  I am very 
concerned about that evidence Mr Molefe.  If I heard that 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 128 of 276 
 
somebody went to an attorney, for example, or advocate 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or a court official ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and said – and used my name 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in order to achieve wrongdoing 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
...I 
would 
be 
very 
concerned 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...because I would never want anybody 
to use my name to advance criminality.  And I would have 
expected that that would be your attitude too. 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, Chairperson what if you do not know 
that person but it is alleged was advancing criminality?  
You do not know them.  You have never met them.  And 
20 
there are allegations that they are advancing criminality 
and they are just allegations.   
 
And my attitude, Chair, would be that you will 
spend your life...  People do all sorts of things.  You will 
spend your life running down rabbit holes which is what I 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 129 of 276 
 
have tried to avoid my life.  Just chasing and chasing and 
chasing rabbit holes.  Rabbit holes that have no meaning.   
 
There is a great example, Chairperson, of a 
farmer who was trying to – who was having a problem with 
a rabbit that was eating the farmer ’s – his vegetable 
garden, vegetable patch.  And he saw the rabbit going to 
the barn and he shot at the rabbit but the barn caught fire.  
The people came to put out the fire.  And the deep 
question remained but what happened to the rabbit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess I understand correctly to 
10 
say as long as you do not know the person who uses your 
name to achieve wrongdoing, corruption, criminality, you 
would not be concerned? 
MR MOLEFE:   As long as I do not know the person who it 
is alleged is using my name.  Is alleged is using my name.  
Then, Chairperson, I had all sorts of other things to do.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not even want to go to the 
police and say I do not have all the facts but I heard 
somebody is going around, for example the township, 
collecting money using my name for criminal activities, you 
20 
would not even go to the police because you do not know 
them? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, to go to the police you would have to 
have evidence of wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 130 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   And once you have the evidence of 
wrongdoing but it is indeed so and that they are incorrect 
corrupt, that there is evidence that crimes were committed 
then you are obliged to report to the police but as long as 
you meet somebody who says that so and so steals cars 
and he was talking about it and you do not even have 
evidence that that person stole a car, I mean, what are you 
going to say when you get to the police?  [speaking 
vernacular] he is talking about me and you do not even 
know that person. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, continue. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Molefe, perhaps we 
live in different world but …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, you and I do, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I just want you to know that it may very 
well 
be 
that 
the 
submissions 
that 
I 
make 
to 
the 
Chairperson at the Eskom – sorry, the Transnet stream 
evidence will be that many of your answers are simply 
contrary to natural human behaviour and perhaps the 
submission would be, and I am giving you an opportunity to 
20 
answer it, is you are doing this, you are presenting these 
unnatural answers because what you are really trying to do 
is at all costs to distance yourself from the corruption.  
That is why you are doing this.  Do you want to comment 
on that? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 131 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   I disagree with you. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  So let us then deal with your 
ties with the Guptas.  Just before I move on, do I 
understand that you seemed at least a bit surprised when I 
told that Mr Essa was seen by Mr Gama at the Transnet 
offices holding meetings? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I was surprised. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, then you must have been shocked 
to the core when you heard Mr Bester ’s evidence that said 
before the meeting that Bester had with Essa or he made 
10 
the comment, he had a prior meeting with Essa and Singh. 
MR MOLEFE:   And who? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Singh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Who had a meeting with Singh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   They same place they met with you at 
Melrose Arch, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Essa that met with me? 
ADV MYBURGH:   That Mr Essa met with Mr Bester when 
they discussed you, it was in Melrose Arch.  They had had 
an earlier meeting in Melrose Arch, Bester and Essa, 
20 
present at that meeting was Mr Singh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That must have shocked you when he 
heard …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   At that meeting? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 132 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   The meeting preceding the meeting that 
Mr Bester gave evidence about where the comment was 
made about you becoming the next CEO of Eskom.  Did it 
surprise you or not? 
MR MOLEFE:   I would have been surprised that Mr Singh 
had met Mr Essa? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Is that what you are saying? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It had nothing to do with me. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am not asking you that and that is not 
an answer.  You must have been – if you were surprised 
when I told you that Gama says that he saw Essa at the 
Transnet offices meeting with Mr Singh, if you were 
surprised by that how can you not have been surprised by 
Bester ’s evidence that said that he met with Essa and 
Singh?  You must have been surprised. 
MR MOLEFE:   You see, Mr Myburgh, I think you know Mr 
Essa to be corrupt and that Mr Bester ’s gospel truth about 
things that Essa said and what the people that he talked 
20 
about and the meetings that we had, now with hindsight 
surprise you, that – sorry, now with hindsight shock you 
and your find revolting because we are here today and you 
now know what you know but I did not know about the 
corrupt activities and when people say that – when Mr 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 133 of 276 
 
Mcebisi Jonas said that one of the Gupta brothers said 
they will work with Brian Molefe, he does not even 
remember who it was that said so.  I know it not to be true 
that I worked with them in the manner that he was 
suggesting and I do not understand why it should worry me 
in Setswana they say [speaking vernacular], the guilty 
conscience convicts itself, I do not [speaking African 
language] in English.  So the guilty conscience is the one 
that 
– 
so 
if 
you 
do 
not 
have 
a 
guilty 
conscience 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Betrays you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A guilty conscience portrays you. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, ukwahlulela(?) is to give judgment, 
ukwahlulela is to judge yourself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is to – ja, I think it means – it 
must mean that when you hear something being said. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe when you are accused of 
something that you know is true. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your guilty conscience tells you but you 
know that is true. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you might pretend that it is not true 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 134 of 276 
 
but inside your conscience …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know. 
MR MOLEFE:   And a guilty conscience may force you to 
act in a particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because you know that this is – there is 
substance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   So because I did not have that conscience 
10 
that said that when Mr Essa’s name is mentioned I must 
jump and investigate.  I did not do it, I did not see a need 
to do it because my conscience did not demand of me to do 
anything. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now, Mr Molefe, I am not sure that I 
understand all of that.  Let me just go back …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   It means [speaking vernacular]. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, but you did have a guilty 
conscience. 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Because you did know what was going 
on.  Are you suggesting that you did not know at all what 
Mr Essa and the Guptas were up to, that they were – on 
the evidence that has been presented to the Commission 
they 
were 
engaging 
in 
money 
laundering 
using 
the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 135 of 276 
 
business that you were in charge of.  Are you suggesting 
you did not know that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Myburgh, are you saying that I knew? 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am asking you, did you not know? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I am telling you I did not. 
ADV MYBURGH:   You did not know at all/ 
MR MOLEFE:   Not. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And to make it worse, the people that 
were actually the perpetrators, they were friends of yours, 
the Guptas.  We are going to come to that now.  So, Mr 
10 
Molefe, just so that you understand the context in which 
my questioning of you takes place, many …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Myburgh, I think that you would like to 
see a particular outcome and I am sorry if I disappoint you. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, let me -  sorry, if you will just let me 
finish because I was in fairness going to tell you what I am 
going to examine you about. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Many Chief Executive Officers have 
been in your position before where it is found out that 
20 
there is corruption and criminal activity under their watch. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH: 
 
 And 
then 
they 
need 
to 
explain 
themselves, did they know, were they asleep at the wheel, 
were the crooks too cunning or where they complicit and 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 136 of 276 
 
that is really ultimately what the Commission in relation to 
you will have to decide.  Once you accept there was 
corruption and money laundering, the question then is, you 
say you did not know.  Well, why do you say that, why did 
not know?  Were you diligent enough?  Were you asleep at 
the wheel?  Were these crooks too cunning for you or were 
you actually complicit and those are what my questions are 
directed at.  So it is not that I want any particular outcome, 
I want to be able or the Commission wants to be able to 
answer that question.  That is why I am probing you.  So 
10 
let me just start out by asking you this.  Do …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   So you will try to determine whether I 
knew? 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is what I am asking you, are you 
suggesting that you did not know? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay.  Alright, so then the question of 
course arises but why did you not know and how is that 
you could not have known?  Now in fairness to you, those 
are always hard questions for CEOs in your position to 
20 
answer but in fairness to you, I need to point out that what 
makes your position so much more difficult is that you were 
friends with the perpetrators.  You were frequenting their 
house, you had a seat at the table, yet you say you did not 
know.  How is that possible?  Were you being played by 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 137 of 276 
 
these people?  Do you feel portrayed by these people?  
Those are questions that we need to ask and need to be 
answered by you over the course of the next [indistinct – 
dropping voice] and I put that to you in fairness.  Now let 
us start this line of questioning by me asking …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe, Mr Myburgh, please do not 
forget the question you wanted to put just now before we 
move too far.  I want to go back a little bit to what you said 
about what your conscience or anybody’s conscience might 
do when a certain accusation is made.  I want to say what 
10 
do you say about this proposition, that when something – 
when an accusation is being made against you – and now I 
am not talking about you, Mr Brian Molefe, anybody.  If you 
know it to be true, you may well do nothing about it 
because you know it is true.  You accept that that is one of 
the reactions that can happen.  I am talking now in 
general, it is a general proposition. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  If I know it to be true… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Definitely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Then my reaction might be different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   If I cannot ascertain whether it is true or 
not, I do not know if I will invest my time to pursuing it if 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 138 of 276 
 
maybe it is fifty/fifty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Or maybe if it is unlikely or like I say but 
people that I do not know at the dinner table.  So if I know 
it to be definitely true then maybe my reaction might be 
different but if it is something that is just a spurious 
allegation then I would not pursue it.  I mean, there have 
been suggestions that I was going to be the next CEO of 
SAA.  I have never gone and investigated who said it, why 
they said it and  - like I say, it is a rabbit hole that you end 
10 
up pursuing to no end, wasting time and resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, what do you say to – what would 
you say to a proposition that the reason why you may not 
have been, is it surprised, when the New Age predicted 
that you were going to – maybe predict is not the right 
word, they said they had it on good authority that you 
would be the next CEO of Transnet and when you did 
become Group CEO of Transnet a few months after the 
article and a few months after the journalist had contacted 
you, what do you say to the proposition that the reason 
20 
why you did not want to find out how come the New Age 
got this so correctly is because you knew how they knew 
because you also knew that you were going to be the next 
Group CEO, so there was nothing to investigate because 
you knew where they go the information from.  What would 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 139 of 276 
 
you say to that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, Chairperson, if that question is very 
important to you and it needs to be investigated, right, and 
the question is when they say that they heard it from good 
authority, who was the good authority?  I think that is what 
should interest me.  I am telling you that I did not know 
anything about it, I was definitely not the good authority 
that they were talking about  The source of that story was, 
as they say, good authority.  So who was it?   
Perhaps the Commission should have investigated, 
10 
perhaps you should have asked the journalist, call the 
journalist here and say when you said you heard it from 
good authority, who was the good authority?  Did Brian 
Molefe know about it?  What did he say when you 
confronted him with the question?   Because what I said 
when Io was confronted with the question was actually 
fortunately published, I do not know about it, nobody talked 
to me about it, I do not know anything about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, so let us go back – let us start then 
20 
with your …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Because, Chairperson, I think that now it 
appears to me that just because the Commission did not 
investigate who the good authority was, it looks like you 
want to keep it on me and say that Molefe, you knew about 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 140 of 276 
 
this and you were part of it and so on and so on when in 
fact the correct thing to have done was to ask this 
journalist where did you get and how come that you were 
so accurate?   I cannot answer those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine, Mr Molefe, and it 
may well be that asking the journalist might be option but I 
know that journalists normally do not want to reveal their 
sources but at least now that you are there, it is legitimate 
to ask you whether you know particularly because it is your 
evidence that you went to the Gupta residence several 
10 
times. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You had a relationship with them so – 
and it was a Gupta-owned newspaper.  So you might have 
said no, I know how it came about, I was approached, blah, 
blah, blah, or I know nothing about it, nobody talked to me. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am telling you that I did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I understand that. 
MR MOLEFE:   And for that I am being ridiculed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, you are not being ridiculed, your 
20 
evidence is being tested.  That is part of investigating. 
MR MOLEFE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what is being done is to put to you 
other possibilities to give you a chance to say no, but that 
is wrong because of a, b, c, d. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 141 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   So, Chairperson, you are saying that this 
line of questioning is part of the investigation of who the 
source was? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not talking about the source.  
Part of what one is trying to do, what the Commission is 
trying to do is what happened, who were the participants, 
who knew what and within the context of the questions – 
Mr Myburgh just explained to you there is the question 
whether you knew about these things or whether you did 
not know, you see, and you will give your evidence, say 
10 
this I knew, this I did not know or I did not know anything 
but it is fair that you should be given a chance to say I did 
not know that, I knew that and this is the position. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  And, Chairperson, I can assure you 
that I have promised that I will cooperate with the 
Commission, I will tell you what I knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then where I did not know anything I 
will tell you that I did not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   But let me say – I will go even further, 
Chair, I will actually desist from speculating as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that is fine, that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I do not think that is fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you must also understand that the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 142 of 276 
 
evidence leader and I do not necessarily have to just 
accept what a witness says.  Some things you hear and 
you do not have further questions, maybe some time later 
you say no, but I should have asked that question.  
Sometime as you hear what the witness says, a question 
arises and you put that to the… 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes.  Except …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Feel free to say what you know, when 
you do not know you say you do not know, it just does not 
mean – it just does not mean that Mr Myburgh, if you say 
10 
you do not know, will necessarily just accept that like that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sometimes he might have no issues with 
you saying you do not know, sometimes he might have 
issues, same thing with me.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Thank you.  So you previously testified 
in the Eskom stream that you knew the three Gupta 
brothers quite well.  You said especially Ajay, you said you 
20 
had a lot of interaction with him, you said that you have 
been to the Saxonwold compound on numerous occasions, 
you said you have lost count now many times and when 
you were there you attended family functions and private 
meetings. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 143 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   You remember that evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you said that whilst it is fashionable 
for people to say that they do not know the Guptas you 
were not one of those people.  So let us just start out by 
dealing with how often you went to Saxonwold.  You say 
that you have lost count how many times.  How many times 
did you go there? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know, numerous times. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, on a let us say in average month 
how many times would you go there? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not – I cannot remember, Chair, 
because …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Come, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   It was seven, eight, nine years ago. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes but you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   A month, are you saying seven, eight a 
months? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, seven, eight, nine years ago. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Like it happened, ja.  It depends, I mean, 
as I said, it was a live issue that we had reason to discuss 
which was the formation of the bank or the purchase of a 
bank and that we would discuss and we had tried to do it 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 144 of 276 
 
before I even went to Transnet and even after I had left to 
go to Transnet there would be occasion to talk about 
maybe a development or a – talk about a possibility or a – 
whatever needed to be discussed along those lines which 
conversations I assume are not part of the [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, just to recap from your evidence 
under the Eskom work stream, is my understanding correct 
that you said that your relationship with the Guptas 
preceded 2011 by a number of years? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, maybe two.  Not the relationships 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you interactions with them. 
MR MOLEFE:   Knowing them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Knowing them? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, knowing them, talking about them, 
knowing them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then when I tried to do this bank and I 
went to them to ask them if there would be a way that they 
20 
could assist me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And that is when you can say on this stuff I 
had left the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, you mentioned two years, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 145 of 276 
 
are you saying there had been the relationship with them 
might have started about two years before 2011 but 
knowing them might have happened a number of years 
earlier? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Yes, 
they 
tried 
to 
do 
deal 
with 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   PIC. 
MR MOLEFE:   PIC, that came down in that context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So – sorry, Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Molefe, please, I just want you to 
answer my question and then we can move on.  So in the 
years that you were the GC of Transnet, 2011 to ’15, in an 
average month, how many times would you go to the Gupta 
residence? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know, Chair, because you cannot 
talk of an average month.  Maybe in one month I would go 
three times and then do not go for six months and then 
maybe go once, maybe – it was sporadic. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is difficult to …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, then let us make it in a six month 
period. 
MR MOLEFE:   To attach – it is difficult to attach an 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 146 of 276 
 
average to it.   
ADV MYBURGH:   Well…. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know, maybe once a month on 
average. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Once a month? 
MR MOLEFE:   Over a six months period – over a 12 month 
period.    
ADV MYBURGH:   Over a five year period. 
MR MOLEFE:   Over a – no, I do not know …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am sure you went there more than that 
10 
because that is only 60 times. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because it is not linear as well, so… 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   It is not linear, so you cannot take – if I say 
that I went there two times every six months you cannot 
say over a five year period I went two times, six months, 
ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   It seems that you went there even on 
those calculations very often but let me just ask you this or 
perhaps put to you this. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   But, Mr Myburgh, I do not know how you 
arrived these conclusions that you are now putting into the 
record as if they are evidence. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, I am going to use your own maths.  
You say well, could be once a month, twice a month, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 147 of 276 
 
whatever, but over a five year period that mounts up, Mr 
Molefe, it is on a – as you say, you have lost count how 
many times you went because you went there so often, not 
because you went there so little, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I understand mathematics is a complex 
subject maybe for you, Mr Myburgh, but I also said you 
cannot impute a linear relationship. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which means that you cannot therefore 
draw a graph. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, let us try and get …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   If you drew the graph you would arrive at a 
conclusion that I was there last month. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Let us deal with some of the evidence 
and try and get to some of the maths. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Witness 1 says that he took you to 
Saxonwold 11 times in 14 months between July 2011 and 
September 2012.  Would you accept that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes but who is witness 1? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   But would you accept that you would 
have gone there …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, it may well be true. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 148 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   So that gets us to about once the month 
as you said. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Right. 
MR MOLEFE:   But then, you see, the thing about linearity 
is that maybe during that period it was 11 times over a 14 
month period, maybe in the next 14 months I went there 
twice of thrice. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No but you went there more than 11 
times because witness 2 actually says that when he went 
10 
there he saw you there, now not in your official car, but in 
your private car.  So do you accept that you would go to 
the 
Gupta 
compound, 
sometimes 
driven 
there 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   That was witness 3. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry, just – do you accept that you 
went there …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   It was not witness 2, it was witness 3, 
witness 2 never mentioned my name. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright, I think you may be right.  But do 
20 
you accept that sometimes you went there in an official 
car, I call that a Transnet car, and on other occasions you 
went in your private vehicle, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  So I just want to get a sense of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 149 of 276 
 
when you say you attended family functions, what sort of 
functions would that be? 
MR MOLEFE:   They would have the one – and, I do not 
know, whenever they had occasion.  They would invite me, 
sometimes I would go, sometimes I would not go.   
ADV MYBURGH:   So whenever they had occasions they 
would invite you, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay.  And you said that you would 
attend private meetings and I really want to just get a 
10 
sense of during the time that you were the GC of Transnet, 
those four or five years, what sort of private meetings were 
you having? 
MR MOLEFE:   To talk about the bank, to talk about 
developments in the banking sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just raise your voice. 
MR MOLEFE:   To talk about the bank, to talk about 
developments 
in 
the 
banking 
sector, 
to 
talk 
about 
developments with period the person that had agreed to 
help us establish the bank.  To talk about different things. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Mainly relating to the fact that we had been 
trying to establish a bank. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But, Mr Molefe, you see what I want to 
ask you about, are those meetings or are those friendly 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 150 of 276 
 
chats that you would have with your friends?  Would you 
really classify these things as meetings? 
MR MOLEFE:   Well, a meeting is when two people come 
together, whether it is on friendly terms or on hostile 
terms, a meeting is a meeting, as in meet, so… 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright, so let us deal with some other 
figures. 
MR MOLEFE:   So I was not really going into different 
classifications of meetings in terms of the literature. 
ADV MYBURGH:   The Public Protector found that between 
10 
August and November of 2015 you visited the Saxonwold 
area 19 times.  Do you remember that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I remember that that is what the Public 
Protector said. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is four months, 19 times. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is what the Public Protector said. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Could that have been correct possibly?  
Maybe when you are not following the linear approach, 
perhaps in these months you went there more often. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, if you go into my affidavit… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:   You will see that I deal with that specific 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that you do say you went to the 
Gupta residence several times.  I saw that particular 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 151 of 276 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   I went several times but then on the Public 
Protector ’s report I engaged a communication specialist 
who I gave authority to go and get my telephone report and 
he says in his report that the Public Protector ’s report was 
wrong because in one instance, I – it is in my evidence, I 
went …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it attached to your affidavit? 
MR MOLEFE:   It is attached to my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh, do you want to assist 
10 
him to …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   I am sorry, it is attached to my Eskom 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes.  I thought perhaps I had missed 
something very interesting. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but if you go and check my Eskom 
affidavit. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I deal with that in the report of the 
20 
telecommunication specialist. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   He says in one instance in twenty minutes I 
made, I think, three calls and received about – I made two 
calls or – and received nine calls and the Public Protector 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 152 of 276 
 
counted that in 20 minutes, in 20 minutes in the Saxonwold 
area, and the Public Protector counted that as 11 different 
visits to the Saxonwold area, and the specialist, it is in the 
– perhaps that is why the Eskom stream never asked me 
about the Public Protectors report because it is actually 
arose when I was at Eskom.   
And perhaps because they saw that I - my only, the 
only reason I could fathom for them not being interested in 
the Public Protectors report was that I actually explained 
quite well, the flaws in the Public Protectors report 
10 
and…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    That was of course in 2015. 
MR MOLEFE:   Maybe, Mr Myburgh it would help if you 
went and read my response in the Eskom stream to the 
Public 
Protectors 
report 
and 
the 
affidavit, 
and 
the 
specialist pointed out…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, well if you just give me a 
second, of course, that was in 2015 where the Public 
Protector gave or made those findings in respect of the 
period when you were at Eskom. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, and a specialist pointed out that that 
report of the Public Protector relating to my telephone was 
erroneous.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   It had errors. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 153 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    So how many times did you then, 
when you were Eskom, how often would you go to the 
Gupta’s was it more or less than when you were at 
Transnet? 
Transmit, just simply? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know; it is difficult to say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    You do not know. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I do not think that here was a 
discernible change in pattern when I went to Eskom. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   There was a, yeah. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    It does seem from what I can see 
that things carried on where they left off, really. 
MR MOLEFE:   Where did you see that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    From Transnet to Eskom we will 
come to that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes, I do not deny that I did go to the 
residents even when I was at Eskom. 
And how often…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Physically, I am sorry, what you are 
20 
saying is as far as you are concerned, the frequency of 
your visits to the Gupta’s residents when you were at 
Transnet was no different from the frequency of your visits 
to the Gupta residents when you were at Eskom. 
MR MOLEFE:   I can recall that there was a change in 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 154 of 276 
 
taken or attitude.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    So there was a need for you, too, 
have a series of meeting.  I take it you would also meet 
with AJ Gupta then outside of the Saxonwold residence.  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, that did happen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And was it as often?  
MR MOLEFE:   No, no.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And I take it that you would have 
reciprocated, then, when it came to entertaining the 
10 
Gupta’s. It wasn't a one-way street, I mean they invited 
you to family functions, as you put it every time on each 
occasion, they would invite you sometimes you would go 
sometimes you would not.  I assume you reciprocated 
yourself. 
MR MOLEFE:   They did come to my house once, several 
times. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, and what sort of family 
functions would you have invited them to? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I hardly ever had functions at my house 
20 
but when I do have, for example, occasion to cook a dinner 
I would maybe once in a while, invite them over for dinner. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And how often would you speak on 
the phone to Ajay Gupta? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know Chairperson, because part of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 155 of 276 
 
the problem, because I was not keeping a tab but part of 
the problem was that according to the telephone specialist, 
the Public Protectors report counted incidents where the 
phone was not answered, and where messages were left.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Now I am asking you Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not keep a tab I do not know 
how…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No but you see is it that you do not 
know or you do not want to assist us?  I mean, you are a 
very intelligent person and your contact with the Gupta’s it 
10 
does not just arise now…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No but…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No sorry but if you do not mind me 
finishing please, there is something that you…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   But Mr Myburgh…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on, hang on Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Myburgh it is not necessary to patronise 
me, please do not patronise me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on Mr Molefe let Mr Myburgh 
finish and then you can answer. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   But Chairperson, I take exception to being 
patronised by Mr Myburgh saying that I am an intelligent 
person and so on, and so that is patronising.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but I am simply saying, when you 
get a chance to respond, then you can take the point. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 156 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   When I get a chance to respond, I must tell 
him that he is patronising. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am saying if you want to say anything 
in response to what he is saying, you can say what you 
want to say and then we will take it from there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe it is not my intention to 
patronise you and if you interpreted my question that way, I 
do apologise.  But what I really want to get at is for you 
simply to tell us, do not worry about the Public Protector, 
you have got your concerns about her report, and you say 
10 
it is wrong. 
I am asking you, during the time that you were the 
GC of Transnet those four or five years, typically, how 
often would you speak to Ajay Gupta on the telephone?  
Now, we have managed to deal with how often you visited 
the compound, we want to get a sense, please from you.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    As to how often you would speak to 
him on the phone. 
ADV MOLEFE SC:   Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Sorry, yes. 
ADV MOLEFE SC:    Ja, Mr Molefe has already given an 
answer, he said he did not keep a tab, that is the answer 
he has given.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but I think Mr Myburgh accepts 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 157 of 276 
 
that he might not have kept a tab but wants him to see 
whether he cannot give us a sense in the same way, as he 
did with regard to the visits because with regard to the 
visits, he also did not keep a tab but nevertheless, he was 
able to give a sense, I think that is what Mr Myburgh is 
trying to get. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is dependent on the issues at the 
particular point in time.  He would call or I would call if I 
had something that crossed my mind about a particular 
issue, and I cannot remember how often we spoke, but we 
10 
did speak. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And I assume you would accept you 
spoke often. 
MR MOLEFE:   And I actually hardly ever spoke to the 
other two brothers.  It was just really Mr Ajay that had 
been interested in the bank, because the Public Projector 
also refers to a telephone call from Mr Atul Gupta and 
when we checked my phone records, we found that Mr Atul 
Gupta did call, the call was never answered and I never 
returned the call and the Public Protector counted it as a 
20 
phone call from Mr Atul Gupta to me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Now, Mr Molefe I think you might 
have touched on this before that was the evidence of Mr 
Jonas, I think it also featured in the Eskom stream. 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr who? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356

ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Jonas, where his commenting on 
a meeting that he attended with the Gupta’s and he said 
that Mr Gupta…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I do not recall the evidence of Mr 
Jonas, who is Mr Jonas? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Jonas, this passage was put to 
you from what I understand during…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Jones? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Just if you bear with me, Mr Jonas 
goes to a meeting with the Gupta’s…[intervene] 
10 
MR MOLEFE:    Oh Jonas.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    They offered him the position of 
Finance Minister. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh Jonas, I thought you said…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh maybe, I was also trying to think 
which witness was that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, Mr Jonas, Jonas. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, so and I think you might 
have already referred to this in passing, but I just read 
20 
what he said.  He said now his referring to Mr Gupta: 
“That they had worked closely with a number of 
people, including Lynn Brown, and Brian Molefe 
related and as a result, they were protected.” 
In other words, those people who worked with them are 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 159 of 276 
 
protected.  He said that: 
“Mr Molefe is very safe, and that his career path is 
very clear, and that no one would touch him, and 
that I would be safe to.” 
I think this passage has been put to you, it is quite 
startling, is it not? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, I put that to you, even though I did 
not quote, but the gist of it when you were giving evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson, I cannot comment on Mr 
Jonas's evidence.  I mean, I was not there. He says 
10 
somebody who he cannot say for sure, it was said all of 
those things and I said I could not comment on it.  
But what I could comment on was my career and 
when you did put it to me, I said to you that I do not think 
that my career requires assistance from a person that Mr 
Jonas had had met on the corridors. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I have actually reflected on that 
answer of yours, and I really do not understand it, because 
it is not about whether you needed the Gupta’s. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I mean firstly one, they may have 
needed you. 
MR MOLEFE:   You reflected on that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Ja, I have reflected on the evidence 
that you gave and the answer that was published in the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 160 of 276 
 
newspaper.  Where it was reported, as you say, look, I do 
not need people I have got a lot of experience and I had 
my career path. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I cannot comment on your reflection. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But that is not the issue here.  You 
accept that perhaps the Gupta’s needed you. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do not know Chairperson; no I do not 
know that the Gupta’s needed me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe this passage really does 
show that you were very much in the Gupta camp. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   This passage, from Mr Jonas the story that 
he was told by somebody in a corridor.  A person who – he 
does not really recall…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Not in a corridor, in a meeting at the 
Gupta residence. 
MR MOLEFE:   I seem to recall that somebody was passing 
in that corridor, and they said, Mr…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, there are two versions. 
MR MOLEFE:   And in fact, he does not even recall even 
with your version Chairperson, he says it might have been. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, but let me tell you what the version 
is about, on his version, he had a meeting at the Gupta 
residence on the 23 r d of October 2015 in the afternoon, a 
lunch and at that meeting, where him, Mr Duduzane Zuma, 
Mr Hlongwane and a Gupta brother.  It is true that he was 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 161 of 276 
 
not sure which of the Gupta brothers but what has been 
established through the evidence of Mr Duduzane Zuma 
and maybe Mr Hlongwane is that the Gupta brother who 
was at the Gupta residence on that day is Mr Tony Gupta.  
That is where he says the discussion was but Mr Duduzane 
Zuma and Mr Hlongwane denied that a Gupta brother 
attended that meeting, and that there was the kind of 
discussion that Mr Jonas says took place in that meeting 
with a Gupta brother. 
And they simply say, Mr Tony Gupta popped in at 
10 
some stage, while they that is Mr Duduzane Zuma and Mr 
Hlongwane were having a meeting with Mr Jonas, popped 
in to communicate something to Mr Duduzane Zuma and 
then left, those are the two versions. 
MR MOLEFE:   So this statement that was mentioned by 
one of the Gupta brothers to Mr Jonas was it done in that 
meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, according to Mr Jonas. 
MR MOLEFE:   Did Mr Hlongwane or Mr Duduzane Zuma 
get to hear this person talking like this? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    They denied that such a discussion took 
place between Mr Jonas and any Gupta brother. 
MR MOLEFE:   So both of them denied. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Both of them denied. 
MR MOLEFE:   But Chairperson, I fail to understand how 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 162 of 276 
 
the Commission continues to attach such value to the 
statement by Mr Jonas, that has not been corroborated by 
people who were present. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But you see, Mr Molefe I think you seem 
not to understand something very fundamental about the 
Commission.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The Commission is continuing to 
investigate.  The Commission has not made any findings. 
The Commission has not accepted anybody's version.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is why even when I put that 
version to you, when you were giving evidence under the 
Eskom work stream, I said something to the effect that this 
is what Mr Jonas said and if what he said is true, then, 
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
So, we have not accepted that Mr Jonas version is 
true.  We have not accepted that Mr Duduzane Zuma’s 
version and Mr Hlongwane versions is true. We are still 
probing as to what may be true and what may not be true, 
20 
and the findings will be made later.  
MR MOLEFE:   But Chairperson you see that statement, as 
is put by Mr Jonas, that is not corroborated.  If it were 
true, it would advance a particular narrative that will excite 
Mr Myburgh.   
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 163 of 276 
 
So to the extent that it looks like I mean, I have had 
it repeated even in my absence here in the Commission, 
during the evidence of others that he has said, but Mr 
Jonas say, but Mr Jonas say even now and the feeling that 
I have is that that statement of Mr Jonas that was said by 
this person, it has not been corroborated.  That was in any 
event, hearsay evidence.  It looks like the Commission 
attaches a lot of weight to it just like Mr Besters statement 
that, I doubt - I do not know maybe it has been 
corroborated.  
10 
But while we were at the dinner it is indeed true 
that Mr Salim Essa did mention this.  So there I do not 
know if there were any attempts to corroborate this 
evidence that I am now being confronted with, that I now 
have to respond to, on the basis of which I am now being 
ridiculed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But you see – no, no nobody is 
ridiculing you Mr Molefe, if that is the word you used just 
now. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Nobody is ridiculing you, the 
attempt is to get your input on how you see things based 
on what you know and it is up to you to say, but I hear 
what you say, Mr Jonas said, but I would say this 
Commission should reject that evidence of Mr Jonas, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 164 of 276 
 
because there are two witnesses who deny what he says 
happened, that kind of thing that is the response. 
MR MOLEFE:   But I have said that Mr Myburgh is 
repeating it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But that is because we had - just 
because you say it does not mean we immediately accept 
that 
okay, 
Mr 
Brian 
Molefe 
has 
said 
now 
he 
rejects…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   But when Mr Jonas says it, it is accepted 
immediately. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    But when that is put to you, certainly 
when I put it and I think when Mr Myburgh puts it, it is on 
the basis to say, if we were to accept, if it was to be 
accepted that what he said was true, but whether it will 
ultimately be accepted as true, is something that will be 
seen when all the evidence has been added.  The idea is to 
test the soundness of various aspects of evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, well all I was suggesting Chairperson, 
was that perhaps, if we want to check if that is true.  We 
should ask the people who were present to corroborate 
20 
what Mr Jonas was saying.  And if they cannot corroborate 
it, or if no attempt has been made to corroborate from the 
people who were present, it is really unfair to be asking me 
who was not present, what if I think that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, you see, Mr Molefe. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 165 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:    If for example, some of the propositions 
that Mr Myburgh puts to you because they are based on 
saying, well, maybe this is how the evidence should be 
looked at, if you were not to put that to you but later on, he 
presents arguments to me to say you must reject Mr 
Molefe’s 
evidence 
that 
he 
knew 
nothing 
about 
this, 
because of A, B, C, D.  And he never gave you a chance to 
deal with those propositions, you may have a case to say 
but he was unfair to me why did he not put this to me, so 
10 
that I could show how flawed the proposition was that kind 
of - so the idea is just to make sure that one, there is 
fairness to for you, but if you say, look, I cannot - I do not 
know, I do not know that or I cannot answer that, it is fine.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chairperson just for the record.  Also, I 
cannot answer what happened that day with Mr Jonas.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, was there a time when you 
20 
stopped going to the Saxonwold residence of the Gupta’s? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot remember making that conscious 
decision but maybe there was a time when I was less I 
frequented the place. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Did you there up until they fled to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 166 of 276 
 
Dubai?  
MR MOLEFE:   No, no, I suppose Chairperson, I cannot 
say that I had decided not to go there because I was I was 
afraid of the accusations and so on and so forth.  But 
yeah, there was a time when I was not going to their 
residence anymore. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, but what caused you to stop 
going there? 
MR MOLEFE:    I do not know Chairperson; I think we just 
drifted apart.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   We just drifted apart. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You know, whether you went there after 
the Public Protectors report? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I did after the Public Protectors report, 
I think I did.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay.  But maybe I can take this 
opportunity to ask a question relating to the Public 
Protectors report.  My recollection is that when you reacted 
to the Public Protectors report, you did not want to say 
20 
whether or not you had been to the Gupta residence and 
that you said there were, there was a shift in there, 
although I think you were, maybe smiling or laughing.  So 
maybe that was not serious. 
Am I correct to say, at that stage you did not say, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 167 of 276 
 
well, it is true I have been there and I have been there 
many times? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, the Public Protectors report said, Mr 
Molefe’s telephone record says in the Saxonwold area, not 
that the Gupta’s residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   If actually the Public Protector had 
interviewed me and allowed me the opportunity to ask as 
the Act demand question about the evidence that she had, 
I would have asked her when you say I was in the 
10 
Saxonwold area, what technology did you use, how did you 
really do it?  Because she does not really say how the 
telephone records was done.  But when I was going to eat 
at the time, I said that, on that morning, I think we were 
giving on financial, I walked into the Eskom Executive 
Committee and I sat there with the whole executive 
committee.  I actually kept quiet for a few seconds and 
then I said, the Public Protector says I was in the 
Saxonwold area. 
And that means that I was at the Gupta residence 
20 
can somebody balance me if I was in the Saxonwold area 
my telephone records say I was in the Saxonwold area, 
does that mean that I was at the Gupta residence?  I was 
not saying I was there, or I was not there, I was just saying 
the veracity of the Public Protectors claim that I was at the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 168 of 276 
 
Gupta residence  
And 
then 
one 
member 
of 
the 
executive, 
Mr 
Chaustery[?] and I said it over and over again.  Mr 
Chaustery[?] says that is ridiculous because actually in 
that area there is a shebeen and if yet she had asked me, 
she would have seen that I always go to a shebeen.   
So, I said Chaustery[?], really and he said yes and 
then later on in afternoon, when I was talking about during 
the results announcement I said, you know, Chaustery[?] 
here, says there is a shebeen there, he says there and that 
10 
if they had asked him they would have found that, in fact, 
there is shebeen there.  I was saying what Chaustery[?] 
had said in the morning.  And then, I then also said so 
using this logic the Public Protector if she had looked at 
my phone record, she would have found that every day, I 
pass on the N1 in Midrand to go home.  In the morning and 
in the afternoon and I am less than one and a half 
kilometres away from a place called Kisa[?] in Midrand. 
She might as well have come to the conclusion that 
every day from Monday to Friday in the morning and in the 
20 
evening, I go to Kisa[?], but that would have been wrong, 
her logic is wrong.  So I did not say that there was a 
shebeen in fact, the Sunday Times did publish an article 
that says that Mr Molefe said he was at the shebeen and I 
challenged it with the person, that was what I did and he 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 169 of 276 
 
said after listening carefully, what Mr Molefe had said he 
never said he was at a shebeen.  
And yet, despite all of that, the media went on and 
on about the shebeen.  Chairperson, I also said in that at 
Eskom there was a man in Cape Town, just forget his 
name, who had been found to have tampered with his 
meter. electricity grid. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Tampered with? 
MR MOLEFE:   With his electricity meter, you know the 
meter that measures how much electricity. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   So they tampered with it so that it does not 
register the unit.  So the Eskom officials went to his house 
and found that the meter had been tampered with, and then 
he admitted to it, they found him guilty, they fined him I 
think R10 000,00 he paid it.  
And a few months later, they came to his house to 
check his meter again and they found that it had been 
tampered with and on the spot they disconnected his 
electricity and fined him again and refused to reconnect 
20 
him until he had paid his fine, which was I think, was 
double what the fine has been.  And then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    What is the point about that story? 
MR MOLEFE:   And then the person went to the Public 
Protector to complain, to complain that he has been 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 170 of 276 
 
disconnected from the grid. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but what is the relevance of that 
story to what you are dealing with? 
MR MOLEFE:   You will hear it when I get to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but I do not want you to take too 
long in case after 30 minutes I find that it is not relevant. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chairperson I have been waiting five 
and a half years to tell this story. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but I do not want you to take too 
long if you can indicate to me this is the relevance, that 
10 
will help. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but okay but then the Public Protector 
found that the fact that this guy had been found to have 
been tampering with his meter before, does not mean that 
he had now been tampering with the meter and that Eskom 
should have had a process to determine whether or not he 
had been tampering with it. 
And she said, some prophetic words, in that finding, 
she says, the fact that a person is known to be a goat 
thief, it does not mean that when you see him next to a 
20 
head of goats, that he has stolen the goats.  The fact that 
a known goat thief is walking next to sheep to the goats, 
does not mean that he has stolen the goats.  
And I said, even at that time in 2016, that it is 
strange, then, that if the Public Protector places me in 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 171 of 276 
 
Saxonwold next to the proverbial head of sheep, or goats, 
it means that I was doing something wrong.  So that is the 
relevance of the story that the Public Protector herself had 
come to a conclusion without due process, something that 
she had found us guilty of doing as Eskom in the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But you knew yourself at the time in 
2016, that even though she might have been talking about 
your telephone records, or cell phone records, reflecting 
that you were on a number of occasions in the vicinity of – 
or in Saxonwold. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You knew that she was really trying to 
look at to what extent there may have been a relationship 
between yourself and the Gupta’s and you knew that you 
had frequented the residence many, several times as you 
put it, is that right? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chairperson, what I knew at the time, 
was that Glencoe had been to her and that we were having 
a colossal fight, and that she had chosen to listen to and 
that this marathon had been created by Glencoe and 
20 
battled in the media.  As I said, when I was giving evidence 
in Eskom you would be surprised what R1billion can 
achieve and for them, R1billion could buy. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but you are not suggesting to me 
Mr Molefe, are you that in 2016, when you were reacting to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 172 of 276 
 
the Public Protectors report, you did not know, that you 
had been to the Gupta residence several times.  Do you 
accept that you have been? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   But Chairperson, what I did know is that 
nobody had proven any impropriety. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   And that was the whole point of the whole 
thing to suggest that there had been impropriety.  That is 
10 
why I talk about the story of the man walking next to the 
sheep, it does not mean he has stolen them. 
 
So to suggest impropriety you had to do much more 
than 
what 
the 
Public 
Protector 
did. 
 
She 
basically 
Chairperson pulled my name over the coals and caused my 
name to be tarnished without a proper investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh before you continue are we all 
of the same understanding that if necessary we will go into 
20 
the evening with Mr Molefe’s evidence?  Let me start with 
you Mr Molefe from your side you have no problem with that? 
MR MOLEFE:  They can go on until midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Counsel for Mr Molefe that is 
fine with you as well? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 173 of 276 
 
 We should not have any problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh no problem. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well I cannot be the odd one out I 
suppose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you – do you think we conspired to 
make sure we put you into a corner where you cannot just 
jump out. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is Mr Molefe’s narrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  So you are not able to put 
10 
a date even an approximate date when you stopped going to 
the Gupta residence? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes, yes I cannot – I cannot put a date.  Ja I 
suppose by the time I left Eskom or after I had left Eskom I 
really did not frequent the 00:01:37. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  When you look back having heard the 
evidence that has been presented in this – this commission 
do you feel at all betrayed by the Gupta’s?  Do you feel that 
you were perhaps played by them? 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know Chair that they played me; 
20 
maybe they I do not know but what I – what I do feel – what I 
definitely feel is that there have been suggestions that I 
have – I did things that are wrong and there has not been 
evidence to show exactly what it is that I did wrong.   
 
I have no regrets that I knew the Gupta’s.  I have no 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 174 of 276 
 
regrets that I had gone to their house; that I had spoken to 
them over the phone.  I was not the only South African that 
did that.  However I also feel that for anyone suggests that I 
was involved in wrongdoing they have to come with proper 
evidence and that has not been forthcoming. 
 
What has been forthcoming is this – is this – this 
narrative as I put it but you were walking too close to she.  
The proverbial votes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is how perhaps I think is perhaps 
a different question.  What is your answer to whether you 
10 
feel betrayed by the Gupta’s is it yes or no? 
MR MOLEFE:  No I feel that I was done in by the Public 
Protector – the Public Protector.. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you do not feel betrayed by the 
Gupta’s? 
MR MOLEFE:  No the person who was supposed to protect 
me from this onslaught that happened because of evidence 
or in the absence of evidence the person that was supposed 
to protect me was the Public Protector.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  The – the Gupta’s I do not know they may 
have done what they did but I was not part of it so I do not 
… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe that is why I do not really 
understand your answer.  Assume for a moment that they did 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 175 of 276 
 
what they did and there you were at the Gupta compound; 
there you were a friend of theirs. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  On your version they were not being 
transparent with you; they were not telling you what was 
happening; they played you.  Do you not feel betrayed at all 
by them? 
MR MOLEFE:  Chairperson the thing that makes me feel 
betrayed is I feel like somebody walked into the Gupta 
residence and they had (inaudible) maybe – maybe let us 
10 
say it was the police or the Hawks or whatever and then all 
they did was to open fire and kill everything that was moving 
there including myself.  
 
When they did not ask why are you here, what are 
you doing here and this is what you doing and this is what is 
wrong about your being here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr … 
MR MOLEFE:  So I feel like – I feel like the Public Protector 
just went in there and just opened fire. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Molefe. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Putting a machine gun on rapid fire and shot 
at everything that was moving. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You are not answer my question 
because you – again go into your culpability.  I am not 
asking you about your culpability.  Let us assume for a 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 176 of 276 
 
moment that you completely innocent and you did not know 
anything about this my question is, surely you must feel 
betrayed by the Gupta’s?   
MR MOLEFE:  But… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There assuming for a moment that they 
were involved in large scale money laundering from the very 
business that you were in charge of and they did not tell you 
this and you fostered this four year relationship.  It seems to 
me the obvious answer must be to the Chairperson I was – I 
cannot believe that these people did this to me I feel 
10 
betrayed. 
MR MOLEFE:  Well – you and I are wired differently. 
ADV MOTSEPE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Mr Myburgh makes it a conclusion that the 
Gupta’s were involved in money laundering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says on the assumption as I understood 
him.  He said let us assume that they were involved in 
money laundering among other things and let us assume that 
Mr Molefe is innocent and was not involved on that so that – 
20 
as I understood it that is how he started his question – his 
proposition.  Did you hear differently? 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Ja, no I heard differently.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us… 
ADV MOTSEPE:  And 00:06:15 position. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 177 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let us just check with Mr 
Myburgh.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And certainly it was my intention to put 
it in that qualified way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:    But Chairperson if I am found with 
somebody who stole a car for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry I thought it was still your 
10 
Counsel talking. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh sorry, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is you.  No, no your 00:06:42 is done 
but for some reason I thought he was continuing. 
MR MOLEFE:  That is why I say Mr Myburgh I think we are 
wired differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry Mr Molefe let us go back to 
what Mr Myburgh's question was because there is a question 
of whether he made assumptions or not.  So – then you can 
answer let us just get that right.  Mr Myburgh. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  There was… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So –  
MR MOLEFE:  Mr Myburgh says. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am going to try and put my question 
again. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 178 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe then we need to move on.  I 
am going to ask you to try and make a distinction between 
your culpability and the fact that you feel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If any. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That you feel you were shot down by 
the Public Protector that is all I am dealing with now.  Let us 
assume that you are completely innocent.  Let us assume for 
a moment that the Gupta’s were involved in large scale 
money laundering from your business.  And we know that you 
10 
were friendly with them surely then you must feel betrayed 
by them. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja so let us – that is why I say you and I are 
wired differently.  The way that I think about that question is 
let us assume that I am walking down the street with 
somebody who stole a car and then the police come and 
without asking any questions arrest both of us and go and 
torture both of us without asking me or trying to establish 
even from the person that I am arrested with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  My culpability and then put me through porter, 
prison 
whatever 
maybe 
even 
succeed 
in 
getting 
me 
sentenced to prison who do you become angry with? The guy 
that you are walking in the street or is it the police who did 
not do their job?  And that is why I say that the person who 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 179 of 276 
 
betrayed me is the Public Protector because she should have 
known as she said in the case of the guy in Cape Town that 
you need proper investigation before you drag somebody’s 
name into the arena where you are fighting for (inaudible). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So can we record that you do not feel 
betrayed by the Gupta’s – short point?  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:  I feel betrayed by the Public Protector. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you do not feel betrayed by the 
Gupta’s? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I – I must make sure I understand 
that correctly Mr Molefe because I do not want to attribute to 
you something that you did not say or mean.  You seem to be 
saying if you are friends – if you are friends with somebody 
and you are in charge of an entity such as Transnet and that 
friend of yours goes behind your back and effectively steals 
money from Transnet the entity of which you are in charge 
you will not feel that that friend of yours has betrayed you? 
MR MOLEFE:  By the way we are still going to give evidence 
20 
about the stealing of the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no let us talk the general proposition. 
MR MOLEFE:  Oh ja well if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that you would not feel that 
your friend has betrayed you? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 180 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Eventually.  Eventually there is proof beyond 
reasonable doubt or if – even on the basis of the commission 
if there is findings that there was indeed laundering then I 
will feel betrayed.  The constitution Chair says people must 
be – must have until proven guilty.  The way that we are 
approaching this whole problem of the Gupta’s is that guilt 
has already been ascribed before there has been proper 
processing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – well I have been saying to you that 
no findings have been made. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have been saying that quite a few times. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we are probing to see what aspects of 
whose evidence are sound or are probably true and 
sometimes at this stage I might think part of what you say is 
true but later on when I sit down and have heard other 
witnesses I might change my mind.   
MR MOLEFE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So findings have not been made but we 
20 
are probing – we have to test them ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  And Chairperson I said – I said one day in 
Parliament when I asked a similar question about the 
Gupta’s I said you know you may be ascribing guilt to them 
and you say they did wrong things and so on and you may 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 181 of 276 
 
well be right but until there has been proper processing – 
proper processes of – of ascertaining their guilt then I mean 
it is like seeing somebody kills somebody and this person 
that killed somebody we know who this person is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us. 
MR MOLEFE:  And you saying – you are asking me do you 
think – do you think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I understand what you say Mr 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  Do you think that the murderer betrayed you 
10 
when the guy who committed the murder or alleged who 
committed the murder has not been convicted of murder.  
There may well be evidence that they did things that are 
wrong but Chairperson let me – or let me – to answer Mr 
Myburgh’s question correctly then.  The day that you make 
your finding and the day that they have been arrested and 
being put in prison and have been found guilty in terms of – 
of the laws of our land perhaps at that point I will feel 
betrayed but at the moment I really take the constitutional 
principle of not guilty until found guilty very seriously.  I said 
20 
this to Parliament once that really I suspect the thing that 
has captured me is our constitution.  With our constitution 
that even the Gupta’s have rights in terms of our constitution 
and that was the spirit of our constitution because what 
Parliament was saying was that you know these people have 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 182 of 276 
 
done this – they have done this and so on and so forth.  Now 
there are allegations that they stole money and so on and so 
on it may well be true but let us wait for the right legal 
processes to unfold.  Perhaps at that point Mr Myburgh you 
can ask me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well of course you… 
MR MOLEFE:  Do you feel betrayed and I will say now I 
really feel betrayed but for now I cannot be sitting here and 
agreeing with you that they are guilty because like me they 
have not been put through a proper legal process by a – a 
10 
forum that is recognised by our law and our constitution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know of course that they fled the 
country and you probably also know that they said in 
affidavits that were read out in an open hearing of the 
commission that they would never come back to this country 
and they did not want to subject themselves to legal 
processes in this country because they think that among 
others the Hawks and the NPA are unfair to them so that is – 
you know that that is the attitude they conveyed to this 
commission in 2018 or 2019 when they applied for leave to 
20 
cross-examine. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes and that their assets were attached and 
subsequently returned because I do not know what the Judge 
found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 183 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  After their assets were attached then after a 
proper legal process they were returned.  So I would rather 
wait for the courts in – in – where… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may wait forever because they might 
never come back.  They fled the country.  They – the legal 
system Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  It is a very interesting constitutional question 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
MR MOLEFE:  Of whether – of a person who is not guilty 
10 
until proven guilty if that person flees does that suddenly 
mean that you can treat them as being guilty? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I just want to say this Mr Molefe it 
is quite interesting that you referred to the position that 
initially their assets were attached or – and then – but then 
later on they – their assets were returned to them.  The legal 
system which made sure that if initially their assets were 
taken from them wrongly were returned to them.  The very 
system that – legal system that made sure they were 
returned to them that is the system they did not – they do 
20 
not trust – that is the system that they do not come back to. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja.  But the fact that they do not want to 
come back or that they are there like 00:16:35 they have left 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 184 of 276 
 
the country in terms of our constitution that has captured can 
we then say let us treat these people as if they are guilty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  My Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Mr Molefe when you – 
when you look back at your time as the GCE of Transnet 
perhaps with the benefit of hindsight is there anything that 
you would have done differently? 
MR MOLEFE:  As the GCE of Transnet yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What? 
MR MOLEFE:  Perhaps I – perhaps I should not have gone 
10 
to Eskom at the time when I was asked to go to Eskom.  
Perhaps I was too disciplined and to agree to go to Eskom.  
Because 
Chairperson 
I 
really 
believed 
in 
the 
market 
00:17:36.  I thought it was a phenomenal program where we 
were involved in a capital program to buy locomotives, buy 
cranes for the ports, to finalise the pipeline, to make a 
Transnet a world class company.  Transnet was returning to 
profitability and sometimes my regret is that I was never 
given the opportunity to see that project come to finality.  
One 
of 
the 
things 
that 
we 
were 
doing 
at 
Transnet 
20 
Chairperson is that we were building a locomotive that would 
be made in South Africa.  That locomotive was built.  We had 
a very exciting project at the CSIR with young engineers that 
were putting together a locomotive of our own.  In fact our 
plan was not to finish the acquisition in terms of the 1064 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 185 of 276 
 
was to replace the tail end of the 1064 with our own made in 
South Africa locomotives.  That locomotive was built and 
commissioned but I do not know where it is now.  So perhaps 
maybe my regret is maybe I should have stayed to see the 
market demand strategy to finality.  Sometime after I had left 
the 
– 
the 
volumes 
that 
we 
had 
picked 
up 
in 
the 
transportation of volumes on the general freight business 
and full line and – and all line the systems that we put up to 
improve operational efficiencies were lost.  Crane movement 
at the ports had increased phenomenally when I was there to 
10 
about thirty moves per hour.  I am told that they are nowhere 
near that at the moment and that the port of Durban for 
example has gone back to where it was before I arrived at 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Try and go closer to the microphone. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think some of your words are being 
swallowed.  You are swallowing. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes.  So that is my regret that perhaps I 
should have stayed. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright you should have stayed.  Is that 
the only thing? 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because I just wanted to put to you 
you know there has been evidence by Dr Molefe, people like 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 186 of 276 
 
Mr Fulmink who have explained.. 
MR MOLEFE:  Which Dr Molefe? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Popo Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he is Dr Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I understand so – sorry have I got it 
mixed up? 
MR MOLEFE:  No because my father is also Dr Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Oh alright no I am talking… 
MR MOLEFE:  And sometimes also … 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You can properly be assured I am not 
10 
referring to your father. 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja and people also refer me to Dr Molefe but I 
frown on it because it is just an honorary doctorate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Let us deal – it is Popo Molefe he has 
given evidence and he has filed an affidavit where he has 
explained the radical remedial action that had to be taken 
within Transnet to right the ship in the wake of you and then 
Mr Gama being the GCE. 
MR MOLEFE:  He says he has explained what? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That radical remedial action had to be 
20 
taken. 
MR MOLEFE:  I do not know what he is talking about. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well Mr Fulmink at a simple level came 
and explained the changes that had to be made to the PPM 
the Procurement Procedures Manual so as to learn lessons 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 187 of 276 
 
and to adapt from what had gone wrong in the past. 
MR MOLEFE:  The changes in the PPM? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:  Which changes in particular? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well I am going to come to his 
evidence in time about confinement, single source contracts, 
confidential confinements.  Many things that you were 
involved in but as I understand it I ask you that question – I 
ask you to introspect and to tell the Chairperson whether you 
would have done anything differently or better and what you 
10 
say to us is well actually you would have just stayed there 
longer. 
MR MOLEFE:  Yes.  Yes I think that if I – sometimes I feel 
that if I had stayed there longer we would have continued the 
successes that we were experiencing on the – one the 
operational side of the business. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I am not just talking about the 
operational side Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  No but I am. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  Ja I am saying that the – the successes that 
we achieved on the operational side that – that those 
successes are the things that positively contributes to... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what about other parts of the 
business? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 188 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:  Economic growth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – Mr Myburgh let him finish. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Finish your answer Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:  The operational side is the side that 
contributes to growth in the economy.   Transnet was not 
from an operational point of view what it used to be when I 
arrived there by the time I left. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now… 
MR MOLEFE:  And that – that would have been seen in the 
10 
credentials. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Molefe turning to a different subject 
you received many … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe now that you are going to another 
subject we should take a short adjournment.  It is four 
o’clock let us take ten minutes break and then we will come 
back.  We adjourn. 
MR MOLEFE:  Thanks. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is – how is the heat on that side of the 
house? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 189 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I think it is fine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is fine.  Okay.  So I think it is this 
side.  [laughs]  But it is fine.  We do not have to switch on 
the aircon as long as it is fine that side.  Okay let us 
continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Molefe, I wanted just 
to change gears now and perhaps deal with the market 
demand strategy.  I think you were speaking about that a 
little earlier? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just for the purposes of the record.  
I will just ask you to confirm.  As I understand it, it is a 
R 300 billion, seven year capital investment programme 
that sought to expand South Africa’s rail, port and pipeline 
infrastructure and the majority of that investment was 
targeted at Freight Rail Operations.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, the majority.  Yes... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understand it.  It was 
announced in April 2011 and shortly after you joined 
Transnet.  Is that right? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   With the investment commencing in 
April the next year. 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot remember exactly when it was 
announced but, yes, it was after I had... 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 190 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So by the time you left Transnet or 
was three years into the MBS? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I assume that the MDS must 
have been amongst your most important tasks, the running 
of that strategy, that programme? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was the most important thing.  A number 
one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I assume it must have been a 
very exciting initiative to be in charge of an organisation 
10 
that had such massive funds available to – for investment 
and expansion? 
MR MOLEFE:   It was exciting to be in charge of an 
organisation that had a plan.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I suppose also onerous?  I 
mean, it brought with it a lot of responsibilities on your 
shoulders, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, sir ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It must have been exciting to be in an 
organisation – in charge of an organisation, not only that 
20 
had a plan but also that had funding because it cannot be 
exciting if there is a plan but there is no funding to 
executive the plan.  
MR MOLEFE:   Well, the 70% of the MDS was to be funded 
from operations and 30% from borrowings but the 70% from 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 191 of 276 
 
operations over the seven year period included from 
improved operations.  So what was really stressful about it 
was that if the operations do not improve during the seven 
year period and we do not realise those funds from 
operations, then the MDS would also collapse because...  
So it really – it had funds that were based on what we were 
going to achieve ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...performance. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, so the – our performance was a 
function of the availability of the funds but also the 
10 
markets would not give us the money, the 30% borrowings 
if we fail in the first couple of years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then also by way of an 
introductory topic.  I just want to ask you a few questions 
about the BADC and delegations of authority.  As I 
understand 
the 
evidence, 
historically 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
including 
sub-committees 
did 
not 
have 
any 
delegated authority for procurement related activities.  
There 
would 
have 
been 
a 
decentralised 
procurement 
20 
system in place?   
 
And this then changed in 2011 with the board 
acquiring procurement powers and a special sub-committee 
of the board being created, the Board Acquisition and 
Disposal Committee, the BADC.  Is that a fair summary to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 192 of 276 
 
the best of your knowledge? 
MR MOLEFE:   When I joined Transnet they had a BADC 
and this was not unusual for a board to have an oversight 
of procurement.  Actually, now that you mention it, I cannot 
remember that Transnet had a history of not having a 
BADC.  It never occurred to me that this was new and that 
it never existed before.  But when I – certainly when I 
joined, there was a BADC that had – that oversaw 
procurement activities.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, the evidence that I 
10 
have 
seen 
says 
that 
in 
2011 
the 
board 
acquired 
procurement powers and the BADC was established. 
MR MOLEFE:   When in 2011? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In 2011.  I presume it might have 
been before you joined. 
MR MOLEFE:   So that must have been in January. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   I joined in, I think, in February. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So do I understand your 
evidence to be that by the time you joined Transnet 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...BADC... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...the BADC was already there. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Some of the stuff that I have put to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 193 of 276 
 
you might have been before your time. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then as I understand the evidence 
in step with the MDS, BADC’s approval authority was 
increased in 2012.  I think it went up to R 2 billion with the 
board being required to approve tenders above this.   
MR MOLEFE:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...your recollection? 
MR MOLEFE:   I saw that but according to the evidence 
that you have.  Who increased the BADC’s authority? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I do not know.  It is from the 
evidence that I have read.  But does that accord with your 
recollection that the BADC’s authority was upped to 
R 2 billion in 2012? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot specifically recall that Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   But, you see, it depends on who increased 
it.  So if it was the board and if it is true that the BADC’s 
authority was increased by the board, then the board had 
authority to do so. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  No, I am not suggesting there 
is anything wrong with this.  I am just – as we go into the 
big procurement tenders, just by way of background, I 
wanted to deal with the MDS and BADC and delegation of 
authority.   
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 194 of 276 
 
 
What we do know, as you have already accepted 
is, 
is 
that 
Mr 
Sharma 
was 
then 
appointed 
as 
the 
chairperson of the BADC in August 2012.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then in 2013, the evidence that has 
been led, is to the effect that there was delegated authority 
to certain individuals to approve high-value transactions.  
The CFO up to R 750 million and you in your position as 
the GCE up to a billion.  You remember that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And effectively what happened is, 
you became – and this is the term, I do not use in the 
pejorative way, but one-person acquisition council.   
MR MOLEFE:   No, that is no true. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You disagree with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I disagree with that wholly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And why do you disagree 
with that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Because there is nothing that I did at 
Transnet, even at Eskom, that had not been recommended. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That had not been...? 
MR MOLEFE:   That had not been recommended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MOLEFE:   From lower down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 195 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   So the instances where I actually wrote a 
memo to approve something myself – I wrote the memo and 
then I approved it myself – are very – I cannot actually 
even recall one.   
 
But everything was originated in the operating 
units and they wrote their recommendation that they 
wanted and the executives had to recommend it and only 
then would I approve.  Sometimes not approve it.   
 
But also, we had a well-functioning Executive 
Committee and that some – the matter – a lot of the 
10 
matters were referred to the Executive Committee for – 
they were approved... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  We are going to come to the 
relevant contact in a moment.  And you are right.  Most of 
them reflect various levels of recommendation or in some 
instances Mr Singh recommending and you signing.  We 
will come to that.  What we also know from the evidence is 
that both the BADC and you and Mr Singh within your 
authority had the power to award tenders on a confinement 
basis. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  Although there was a power to award 
tenders on a confinement basis, as I say, I would rarely do 
it without a recommendation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  No, I accept that.  But you had 
the power? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 196 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now what Mr Foreminck(?) 
[00:09:46] testified to ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Mister who? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Foreminck. 
MR MOLEFE:   Foreminck? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the Corporate Governance 
person. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
The 
Executive 
Manager 
of 
10 
Governance. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He testified that the one-man 
acquisition 
councils 
and 
the 
widespread 
use 
of 
the 
confinement process were amongst the areas of concern or 
problem areas that he had identified ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...which had sought to address in the 
new updated PPM.  Do you accept that that is something 
that happened? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Foreminck is a peace time hero because 
he never raised that issue with me when I was there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  No, I understand that but he is 
one of the people that I referred you to just now, that 
looking back at what happened, Mr 
Foreminck gave 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 197 of 276 
 
evidence that these are changes that we made.  We looked 
to tension up and improve the system.  I take it you do not 
dispute that evidence? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So for much of my questioning of 
you and I am going to really be dealing with your 
involvement in the procurement of goods and services at 
Transnet in that context, context of the MDS, context of the 
BADC and the delegation of authority. 
MR MOLEFE:   But before we proceed.  Let me help you 
10 
also with context.  The other context about procurement at 
the Transnet was that in the process of procurement every 
step there was assurance that was given by assurance 
teams.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That there was assurance...? 
MR MOLEFE:   Assurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR MOLEFE:   That was given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MOLEFE:   By assurance teams. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   For example, they have things that they call 
gate(?), for example, in the...  So there would be the initial 
sort of process and then assurance must be given and then 
assurance will open the gate to the next phase and the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 198 of 276 
 
next phase of the next phase.  So you could not get to from 
identifying a project to – of procurement and get to the 
final payment without assurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you...  Are you saying that after – 
from the time a need was identified for ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...goods or services ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to the time of payment ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...there were various stages in the 
journey? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at each stage ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   There was a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...some assurance that you would be 
given ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that what had happened before that 
stage ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was in order? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the point you are making? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  In fact, those things we called me 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 199 of 276 
 
gates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Gates? 
MR MOLEFE:   That could be only opened by legal 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...and internal audit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   And sometimes external assurance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But everything so far was right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   And that was – for me that was the most 
important thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   For example, when you are having – when 
you have a tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   So when the bid was submitted, before you 
open them, the assurance people come.  Then you open it, 
then you adjudicate it each time they open the gate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now I want to start off by 
asking 
you 
some 
questions 
under 
the 
heading 
of 
Procurement of Consulting and Advisory Services. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 200 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall I find that somewhere in his 
statement or in any document or not really? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I think it is a connection of 
different contracts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...which you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...you become – you are familiar with 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So most of my questioning relates 
then to procurement and I want to start off by Procurement 
of Consulting and Advisory Services and I want to start 
with the one, the 1061 transaction, advisor contract, the 
McKinsey consortium.   
 
Now what the evidence says – and Mr Molefe, 
along the way I am going to summarise it for you and you 
can agree or disagree.  A lot of this is really just 
background to the point that I want to get to. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The evidence is to the effect that 
given the magnitude of the 1064 Locomotive transaction, 
Transnet 
procured, 
we 
know, 
transaction 
advisors, 
effectively external consultants ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 201 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...to provide advisory services in 
respect of four different things.  Firstly, the validation of 
the business case.  Secondly, technical evaluation and 
optimisation and bids.  Thirdly, deal structuring and 
finance.  And then fourthly, procurement advice and legal 
services.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And what we then know in 
relation to the 1064 transaction, advisors contract, is that 
in May or the 30 t h of May 2012, Transnet issued an RFP to 
10 
nine 
consortiums 
on 
a 
confinement 
basis. 
 
Do 
you 
remember that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but when the – when the tender was 
issued, the main consortium, there must have been a memo 
that was ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [Indistinct]  
MR MOLEFE:   You have it there by you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, I do not dispute that.  I 
am...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   No, I just wanted to see it for my 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not suggesting for a moment 
and perhaps I need to also make this point.  I am not 
suggesting 
that 
there 
was 
anything 
wrong 
in 
what 
transpired.  I am trying to get to the point of which I want 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 202 of 276 
 
to question you about.   
MR MOLEFE:   Alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we know is that an RFP is 
issued to nine consortiums on a confinement basis.  And I 
am not suggesting that there is anything irregular about 
that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What then happened is.  On the 
27 t h  of July, the contract is awarded to the McKinsey 
consortium.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it included – it was the main 
bidder and it included as a co-bidder and ST partner a 
concern by the name of Letsema.  Do you recall that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  So it was awarded properly. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
am 
not 
suggesting 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, okay? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I am going to come to the 
problem in a moment.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then what happens is.  On the 
27 t h of August, you approved a memorandum from Mr Sing, 
advising that Letsema had a conflict of interest and 
proposing that it be replaced.  You remember that? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 203 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I remember there was an issue about 
the conflict of interest. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if I can ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   ...involving... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I could ask you, please, to turn to 
your file, Exhibit 22. 
MR MOLEFE:   Exhibit 22? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Start with the bundle Mr Myburgh 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 5.  I beg your pardon.  
Exhibit 22. 
MR MOLEFE:   What is the page number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Five...  Sorry, 405.1.   
CHAIRPERSON:   485.1? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   405.1.  Yes.  Mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   405? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   405.1.  Mr Chairperson, I undertook 
20 
to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...Mr Molefe’s lawyers to point out to 
you 
that 
from 
405.1 
through 
to 
405.94, 
these 
are 
documents that were recently added to the bundle.  For 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 204 of 276 
 
some reason, there was a problem with the transmission of 
these documents and I understand that Mr Molefe might 
only have received them last night.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The agreement that we have is that I 
will point that out to you, place it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When I take Mr Molefe to a 
document, I will place on record too that it is a new 
document.  And obviously, if he needs time to reflect on his 
10 
answers more carefully, we are more than prepared to give 
it to them him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we would also like to just 
express our gratitude to him and his lawyers for not making 
an issue of this in the interest of proceeding with matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Molefe, we had got to the 
memo of 22 August and this – this it is.  You will see if you 
go to page 405.4 that it is sent to you or various levels of 
20 
authority but ultimately you see Mr Singh recommended 
and 
then 
you 
ultimately 
approved 
it 
on 
the 
22 n d of August 2012.  Correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, it was compiled by Mr Josef Mohamed, 
recommended by Gary Peter and Anoj Singh. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 205 of 276 
 
DV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   I approved it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this was a month or so after the 
contract had initially been awarded to McKinsey.  I just 
want to go, if I may, to the purpose of the memorandum at 
page 405.1.  It says: 
“The 
purpose 
of 
this 
memorandum 
is 
to 
request approval of the Group Chief Executive 
for 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
McKinsey 
consortium for the complete advisory services 
10 
and Webber Wentzel for the legal advisory 
services at transaction advisors on the 1064 
tender...” 
 
1.1: 
“For the Group Chief Executive to note that 
McKinsey will be advised to partner another 
firm with equal or better credentials than 
Letsema for the procurement elements due to 
a conflict of interest with Barlow World and 
Letsema...” 
20 
 
I just want to pause there if I may?  So what was 
this conflict of interest involving Letsema? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, Chairperson, as you said, these 
documents were received last night, but if I recall the 
problem was that Barloworld was a potential bidder. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 206 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   Barloworld was a potential bidder. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR MOLEFE:   If I recall from what I said now.  And that 
Letsema was in partnership with Barloworld. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
MR MOLEFE:   And for Letsema to be advising on the bid 
evaluations, because this is what I think this was about, 
there would be a conflict. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But why did ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   As far as I recall the incident, I think that is 
what happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  But ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   But if you read the memo it should say what 
the problem was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, that was the – that is the 
difficulty.  I do not see that. 
MR MOLEFE:   But what I recall was that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It refers to a potential conflict without, it 
seems, specifying the potential conflict. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   What I recall was that Barloworld was a...  
Ja, I...  I do not know...  Maybe, Chairperson, I am making 
a mistake but the conflict that I remember was that 
Barloworld was a potential bidder or a potential partner as 
one of the bidders. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 207 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, two questions though.  I mean, 
firstly, why was that not picked up during the tender 
evaluation process? 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
I 
do 
not 
know 
Chair. 
 
You 
see 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And secondly, why is it not recorded 
in here? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair, I would have to go through these 
documents properly.  As I say ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   ...we – they were handed out last night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fair enough.  Well, he might 
need time to have a look at this Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, look, it is not a lengthy 
document but of course I have no objection.  The other 
option, of course Mr Molefe, is that you could have a look 
at those overnight.  There might be other issues that arise 
and then we could deal with it again tomorrow if you want. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes.  Please, I would like to go 
through ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...through it.  But sitting here, what I 
remember was that Barloworld would be a potential bidder 
and so Letsema advising on the transaction advisory would 
have been a conflict ...[intervenes]  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 208 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   That is what I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is fine.  Go over it overnight. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can deal with it when you 
have had a chance to look at this. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So, and perhaps then we 
could come back to the two questions and that is.  Why 
was it not picked up during the tender evaluation?  And 
why is it not recorded here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But let me take you to paragraph 15 
at page 405.3.  There you see...  Well, at 14 it talks about: 
“The tender evaluation process was concluded 
whereby...” 
 
And it talks about the McKinsey consortium and 
then it says: 
“The Transnet acquisition council awarded the 
McKinsey consortium the completed advisory 
services and split the award providing legal...” 
20 
 
Now that was the decision that was made and we 
know that from the resolution of the Transnet Acquisition 
Council at pages 504.5 and 504.6. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The financial implications, you see 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 209 of 276 
 
McKinsey would get 35% of the value of contract and the 
procurement partner, Letsema, it says:  ...due to a conflict 
of interest would get 20%.  And the value of the contract, it 
appears at 17 is R 15 million.  Is that correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, that is what the memo says. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So that is on the 
22 n d of August.  What we do know, going forward in time, is 
that 
some 
four 
months 
or 
so 
later, 
on 
the 
6 t h  of December 2012, Transnet in the form of Mr Singh and 
McKinsey conclude an LOI.  Do you remember that?  A 
10 
Letter of Intent.  It is not in the bundle.  I will take you 
there. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is not in the bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not in yours.  So let me just go 
through this and Mr Molefe, if there are documents that 
you want to see, then I will take you to them but then you 
must remember we have to go through those files behind 
you.  So let us go through the chronology and see if you 
recall.  So 22 August, we have got that letter.   
MR MOLEFE:   22 August, which years? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   22 August 2012, okay? 
MR MOLEFE:   2012. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I am dealing with what 
happened.  So in other words, there is a recommendation 
which you approved that Letsema can be replaced. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 210 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I am suggesting to you is that 
on the 6 t h of December 2012, Transnet in the form of 
Mr Singh and McKinsey conclude an LOI which reflects that 
Regiments had replaced Letsema.  And perhaps I should 
take you to that document given the importance of it 
because this is how Regiments comes on the scene.   
MR MOLEFE:   On the 12 t h of December? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   6 December. 
MR MOLEFE:   6 t h of December. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just give me a moment, please. 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you please go behind you to 
Exhibit BB-3A? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, your junior, Mr Myburgh, could 
assist him to find the file. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we need is BB-3B.  So I think 
you have A, we need B.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, please help him... 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got – found it?  Oh, you 
want...  Have you got the page Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   BB-3B, page MSM-354.   
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 211 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there are two sets of numbering.  
I am referring to the MSM number, top right hand, 354.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  so this is the Letter of Intent.  
It dated the 30 t h of November 2012.  You will see the 
quality is really poor but what we can make out, if you go 
to page 358, is that on the 4 t h of December it was signed 
10 
by Mr Singh.  And if you go over the page ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   338? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   358. 
MR MOLEFE:   358. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, MSM-358.  It was signed by 
Mr Singh.  MSM-359, it was then signed by McKinsey on 
the 6 t h of December. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. Now if you go to 354, you 
will see in the second paragraph, it says: 
20 
“The parties to this agreement are Transnet... 
[and then we have...] McKinsey Incorporated, 
the 
supplier, 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
consortium, namely...” 
 
And now you see Regiments Capital.  Do you see 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 212 of 276 
 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And so that is how between the 
memo that you signed on the 22 n d of August and now, the 
6 t h of December 2012, it is in that intervening period you 
see that Regiments then replace Letsema.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but Chairperson, as I always said at 
Transnet, before something like this happened, Mr Singh 
enters into an agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please speak up.  Do not lower your 
voice. 
MR MOLEFE:   Before something like this happens, 
Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The replacement? 
MR MOLEFE:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say something like this, you 
mean the replacement? 
MR MOLEFE:   This agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MOLEFE:   ...before something like this gets signed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   There is usually a memo ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is usually...? 
MR MOLEFE:   A memo. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 213 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   That I have always said to Transnet 
Executives which must be written in English so that 
everybody understands as to why we are doing what we are 
doing. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   That is recommended by somebody and 
then approved before we actually do the action, this is the 
action.  So I will be curious to see if there was a memo 
preceding …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, you see, Mr Molefe …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let him finish, Mr Myburgh. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I will be curious to see if there was a 
memo preceding. 
ADV 
MYBURGH: 
 
 
But, 
you 
see, 
you 
perhaps 
I 
misunderstand what happened.  What you recommended, is 
you said to McKinsey you must replace Letsema. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   You said that to McKinsey, McKinsey did 
that. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, I see. 
ADV MYBURGH:   It was McKinsey’s choice, it is not a 
Transnet choice.  So that memo that you are talking about 
is not what you see here. 
MR MOLEFE:   But was there no memo? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 214 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   This is McKinsey – and I am going to 
come and explain to you how it happened. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because even with that, I suspect there 
would have been something that says that look, there was 
a memo before that say McKinsey must replace Letsema 
and 
McKinsey 
has 
suggest 
that 
Letsema 
should 
be 
replaced and so and so and therefore the contract is ready 
to be signed, we recommend that it be signed. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am going to explain to you what 
happened now.  It is one of the startling pieces of evidence 
10 
that have been presented in this Commission.  So the 
question then is, between the 22 August and the 6 
December how does Regiments come to be appointed and I 
want you to consider this.  Have you come across and read 
the evidence of Mr Ian Sinton of Standard Bank given in 
this Commission?   
MR MOLEFE:   No, I just saw that Mr Ian Sinton gave 
evidence 
but 
I 
never 
looked 
at 
his 
affidavit 
or 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   So according to what was reported to Mr 
20 
Sinton by a Mr Niven Pillay and other directors of 
Regiments, their appointment came about in this way, 
okay?  In October of 2012 Kuben Moodley arranged 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   This what Mr Sinton says? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 215 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, it was reported to Mr Sinton. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, this is what Mr Sinton says Mr Pillay 
told him? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja, that is right.  But just bearing in 
mind the context.  Mr Sinton is from Standard Bank and he 
was investigating certain suspicious payments or transfers 
made out of Regiments’ account and that is how he comes 
to give this evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now, Mr Molefe, I am not – so that we 
10 
do not cross swords, I am not suggesting to you that every 
piece of evidence that I am going to put to you is the 
gospel truth and that is what has to be found, I am putting 
to you that that is his evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   The Chairperson will have to decide in 
time whether to accept it but I am just apprising you of 
what the evidence is. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   As to how Regiments comes on the 
20 
scene. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay.  So Mr Sinton says that it is 
reported to him by these two Regiments’ directors that in 
October of 2012 Mr Moodley arranges a meeting between 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 216 of 276 
 
himself, Regiments and Mr Sagar of McKinsey and Mr 
Essa.  Okay?  So you have got …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Sinton, Moodley …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, Sinton is not there. 
MR MOLEFE:   Oh, Moodley… 
ADV MYBURGH:   So what we have is two Regiments’ 
directors. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay and Mr Moodley arranges the 
meeting. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Sagar is there from McKinsey and Mr 
Essa, who you know about but had not met was there.  He 
says that at this meeting Regiments were told that 
Transnet required McKinsey to appoint a black-owned 
supply development partner with 30% of the fees earned, 
as we have seen. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And McKinsey then offered to appoint 
Regiments as its SD partner, provided Regiments agreed to 
20 
pay 30% of all of its income from Transnet to Mr Essa and 
5% to Mr Moodley.  That is how Regiments came to be 
appointed. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I presume you do not know anything 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 217 of 276 
 
about that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  Now you might also have read 
from one of the money flow reports that we will come to in 
a moment, that the money flows team does not necessarily 
consider Mr Pillay to be a reliable witness and questions 
his version about whether Mr Sagar was there, but 
considers it is possible that he is telling the truth.  So the 
concern is not about Mr Sinton, because it was reported to 
him, the question is whether Mr Pillay was telling the truth.  
10 
But what has been determined is that this is the manner in 
which 
Regiments 
came 
onto 
the 
scene 
and 
the 
understanding was that Regiments would then replace 
Letsema but with Regiments on the scene, the deal was 
that they had to pay 30%, which in time was up to 50%, of 
all their earnings on that contract to Mr Essa and 5% to Mr 
Moodley.  That was the evidence of Mr Sinton. 
MR MOLEFE:   So that was the arrangement between 
McKinsey and Regiments? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, you cannot comment, presumably.  
Alright.  And then the rest is history because following 
Regiments’ appointment as McKinsey’s SD partner on the 
1064 advisory contracts and other contracts which we will 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 218 of 276 
 
come to in a moment, more than R200 million was 
transferred from Regiments to Gupta shell companies in 
payment of these fees. 
MR MOLEFE:   From Regiments? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Regiments would pay Gupta shell 
companies, for example Homix, you would have read about 
them. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I heard about Homix when the Gupta 
Leaks first came up. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja, so I suppose on the face of it really 
10 
Mr Essa pulled off something of a heist on that evidence.  
Every rand – because it was up from 30%, every rand that 
was paid to Regiments, they paid 50%, 50 cents in a rand 
to Mr Essa for doing nothing, just because of this 
introduction.  
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So it is now that I want to take you to 
one of the money flow reports, if I may. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Can I ask you please to turn to page 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that bundle – same bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Bundle 5, Chairperson and perhaps we 
need just to start with page 115.  Are you at 115, Mr 
Molefe? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 219 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that we have a 3.3 notice? 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay.  So this is a 3.3 notice that was 
issued to you, you see it is dated the 18 November last 
year, 2020. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And you were advised – and this was 
issued in the run-up to McKinsey giving evidence.  You 
10 
were issued 
with this notice and you 
were told at 
paragraph 4 the topics on which witnesses from McKinsey 
will be questioned and may implicate on the following and 
they list it and you referred there to annexures A and B.  
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again?  Annexures A and B? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja,. paragraph 4 references annexure B 
– An and annexure B.  Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And those are what we refer to as the 
20 
two money flow reports.  The one report you find at page 
120 and I am not going to go to; this now, I am coming to 
it, what I want to take you to though is the second money 
flow report which would have been annexure B and that 
you find at page 324.  Are you there?  324.  I think that is 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 220 of 276 
 
it there. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja.  Are you at 324?  So what this is, Mr 
Molefe, is a report that was drafted by the money flows 
team. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   An investigator by the name of Lisa 
Moeller and it was a report that was part of the documents, 
formal exhibit before the Commission at the hearing of the 
McKinsey evidence.  I want to take you please to page 
10 
325.  Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, this report was done by…? 
ADV MYBURGH:   This is a report done by – so there are 
various different streams within the Commission.  
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, it was done by the Commission. 
ADV MYBURGH:   This is done by the money flow team. 
MR MOLEFE:   Team.  Ja, you see, this is what I was 
referring to about findings. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, well …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   This is one of them that has findings, at the 
20 
beginning when I said …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes,  No, I remember you raising that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Some of the reports have got findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, I think you can accept that it is a 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 221 of 276 
 
report by the money flows team, it might make certain 
factual findings. 
MR MOLEFE:   Let us just say preliminary …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, it is certainly not – it is not a 
finding that the Commission has made, it is simply 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe I need to explain that to Mr 
Molefe because it could be confusing to somebody not 
maybe used to Commissions.  I am the only person who 
would make findings that you should be concerned about. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when investigators investigate, 
investigators of the Commission, they may form some 
views as to what the position is. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe they could even – or some 
witnesses could put that as their conclusions or their 
findings but it is not my findings.  The ones that you should 
be concerned about are those that are made by me. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The ones that they may make or 
conclusions that they make are just opinions and so on and 
they can …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja.  No, I was just saying it so that there is 
a …[intervenes] 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 222 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I accept that you were 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Even if you use other terminology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no. 
MR MOLEFE:   Preliminary or… 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, I understand. 
MR MOLEFE:   Or conclusions or… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But when they say findings… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I understand. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Because they work for the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, I understand, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So, Mr Molefe, perhaps I can also 
explain 
to 
you 
that 
these 
reports 
were 
put 
before 
McKinsey, they were prepared in advance of McKinsey’s 
evidence. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And McKinsey accepted them because 
we will come to the settlement with McKinsey in a moment. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But there are just some aspects of this 
money flow report that I want to take you to and perhaps 
we can go through it in some detail.  At paragraph 1, they 
refer to their previous report which they say shows that 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 223 of 276 
 
Essa orchestrated the incorporation of Regiments as 
McKinsey’s supply development partner.   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I have explained that to you already. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And then Mr Niven Pillay and another 
person of Regiments have repeatedly testified at paragraph 
2 in civil litigation that the original arrangement reached 
between Regiments and Essa, this is at page 325, in this 
regard was that an entity nominated by Essa would receive 
10 
30% of all amounts …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, I 
thought you were at 323, are you now at 325? 
ADV MYBURGH:   I beg your pardon, I am at 325.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   At paragraph 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, sorry, I do not know what is wrong 
with me today from …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am sure it is probably my fault, Mr 
Chairman, I am sorry if I have led you astray.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it is the second time I am 
focusing on red page numbers. 
ADV MYBURGH:   I would have thought if anyone has 
learnt by now it must be you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course.  Ja, no, no, no, that is fine.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 224 of 276 
 
Ja, 325. 
ADV MYBURGH:   325.  So at paragraph 2 they record that 
these two people have repeatedly testified that an entity 
nominated by Essa would receive 30% of all amounts 
received 
by 
Regiments 
flowing 
from 
its 
position 
as 
McKinsey supply development partner at Transnet and an 
additional 5% would be paid to Albatime, a company of 
Kuben Moodley. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Who introduced Regiments to Essa.  I 
10 
have explained that to you.  It is not clear whether this 
30/5% arrangement was ever implemented, the cash flows 
analysed by the Commission show that the arrangement 
actually implemented by Regiments for most of the lifespan 
of the relationship with McKinsey was that Essa’s entities 
were ordinarily paid 50% of Regiments’ revenue from 
Transnet with Albatime being paid 5% Transnet’s revenue, 
leaving Regiments with only 45%.  And then they say at 
paragraph 3 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second.  I think that 
20 
sentence on page 326 starting with: 
“The cash flows analysed by the Commission…” 
Might be a good example of what Mr Molefe was talking 
about. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 225 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Instead of saying analysed by the 
Commission, might be analysed by the money flows team. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, absolutely, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Then it says at paragraph 3: 
“In 
some 
cases 
Regiments’ 
laundering 
arrangements with Essa and Albatime on joint 
McKinsey/Regiments’ contracts with Transnet were 
fraudulently 
presented 
by 
Regiments 
in 
joint 
McKinsey/Regiments bid submissions as Regiments 
10 
supply development arrangements.  In other cases 
the laundering payments were made without any 
pretext of such payments in the proposals submitted 
by McKinsey/Regiments.” 
Paragraph 4: 
“Through these laundering arrangements hundreds 
of millions of rands were laundered through shell 
companies nominated by Essa out of fees paid by 
Transnet to Regiments on the McKinsey/Regiments 
appointments at Transnet.” 
20 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Then they say at paragraph 5 or the 
report says: 
“Regiments has publicly admitted that it had an 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 226 of 276 
 
arrangement with Essa and Moodley that they pay 
Essa and Albatime 50% and 5% respectively of the 
income they received from Transnet in respect of 
contracts 
on 
which 
they 
worked 
alongside 
McKinsey.  They claim that these payments were 
business 
development 
fees 
due 
to 
Essa 
who 
introduced them to McKinsey and to Moodley who 
introduced them to Essa.” 
Paragraph 6: 
“The business development fees paid to Essa were 
10 
simply money laundering payments.  The shell 
companies designated by Essa to receive these 
business development fees changed over time.  
They included Devita… 
Which we will hear about later. 
“…and Homix and a number of others.” 
Over the page: 
“All of these shell companies operated as out and 
out 
money 
laundering 
vehicles 
without 
any 
legitimate business activities.  Revenue received 
20 
from Regiments by these shell companies was 
within 
days, 
laundered 
to 
lower 
level 
money 
laundering 
entities. 
 
Apart 
from 
inflows 
from 
Regiments and other corrupt associates of Essa and 
the Guptas to shell companies had no income.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 227 of 276 
 
Apart from outflows to lower lever laundry entities, 
the 
shell 
companies 
had 
no 
expenses 
of 
consequence.  None of the shell companies paid 
PAYE (employees’ tax) to SARS.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now we get to a part that involves you 
directly at paragraph 6: 
“The joint McKinsey/Regiments proposal in June 
2014 for the coal line contract…” 
10 
Because you signed these contracts together with Mr 
Singh, we are going to come to them in a moment, or you 
signed the confinements. 
“The joint McKinsey/Regiments proposal in June 
2014 for the coal line contract, the LMPP contract , 
stated the Regiments would be using Homix and 
Albatime as site development partners.” 
MR MOLEFE:   The contract stated that Homix will be 
used. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is how bad it was.  I will show you 
20 
the contracts. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   So now Homis actually put up as a site 
development partner of Regiments.  At paragraph 9: 
“The coal line and LMPP contracts were awarded to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 228 of 276 
 
McKinsey and Regiments without any competitive 
bidding process.” 
I will come to the detail in a moment. 
“At 
the 
same 
time 
Transnet 
also 
awarded 
to 
McKinsey and Regiments without any competitive 
bidding process contracts with Kumba Iron Ore and 
manganese contracts.” 
Those are contracts that you or bid confinements that you 
and Mr Singh signed, will come to them in a moment.  10: 
“In the context of preparing joint proposals for 
10 
these contracts, Regiments emailed to McKinsey on 
13 June 2014 a spreadsheet containing a detailed 
breakdown 
of 
fees 
that 
were 
to 
be 
paid 
by 
Regiments to Homix and Albatime in their guise as 
site development partners of Regiments on the four 
contracts. 
 
The 
spreadsheets 
attached 
to 
the 
Regiments’ email of 13 June 2014 provided for 
aggregate amounts in excess of R100 million to be 
paid to Homix and Albatime on the four contracts.” 
Paragraph 11: 
20 
“McKinsey 
has 
confirmed through 
David 
Fine’s 
statement…” 
He works for McKinsey. 
“…to parliament that neither Homix nor Albatime 
were involved in providing services in any project in 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 229 of 276 
 
which 
McKinsey 
were 
involved. 
 
However, 
as 
detailed below, millions of rands were paid to Homix 
and Albatime from the amounts paid by Transnet to 
Regiments in respect of these four contracts and 
other Regiments/McKinsey contracts.” 
MR MOLEFE:   So the money from Transnet to Regiments 
to these companies? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Or was it from Transnet to McKinsey to 
Regiments? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   Well, sometimes they would pay directly 
where they were the skills development partner.  We will 
come to the detail.  So in some instances …[intervenes] 
MR 
MOLEFE: 
 
 
Ja, 
the 
big 
companies 
came 
with 
Regiments. 
ADV MYBURGH:   In some instances what would happen is 
it would be McKinsey and Regiments, right?  And then the 
deal was Transnet would pay Regiments and then those 
amounts would be disbursed to Essa and Albatime through 
Homix, etcetera.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   In other instances what happened is 
when McKinsey/Regiments put in a bid, Regiments put up 
Homix and Albatime as their skills development partners. 
MR MOLEFE:   And then but they would pay their skills 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 230 of 276 
 
development partners. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That is right. 
MR MOLEFE:   After being paid by Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay, so then have a look at paragraph 
12.  So it talks about: 
“In February 2016 Regiments produced an internal 
evaluation of its advisory unit for the purposes of 
determining what payments should be made during 
Wood and Pillay.” 
Etcetera and it says that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That name there, Mr Myburgh, is 
Nyonya. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Nyonya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, just for that …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Between Wood, Pillay and Nyonya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:    
“When Wood with a 32% interest in Regiments took 
the advisory unit with him to Trillian but gave up his 
interest 
on 
all 
other 
business 
units 
within 
20 
Regiments.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I am pronouncing it wrongly somebody 
should let us know but that is my understanding of how it is 
pronounced. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 231 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am indebted to you, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Then there are two other paragraphs 
which I am going to deal with with Mr Singh in particular, 
we can leave those out for the moment but let us just go to 
the conclusions at paragraph 3: 
“Over the period March 2014 to February ’16 
Regiments paid hundreds of millions of rands to 
money laundering vehicles designated by Essa in 
return for his role in corruptly procuring their 
10 
procurement 
to 
contracts 
with 
state 
owned 
enterprises.” 
16: 
“More than 200 million of these laundry payments 
derived from fees paid to Regiments on contracts 
where they worked as McKinsey’s site development 
partner at Transnet.” 
17: 
“In some of its joint proposals with McKinsey 
Regiments fraudulently provided for these laundry 
20 
payments by describing Essa’s laundry vehicle, 
Homix, as Regiments as site development partner.” 
So you get the picture generally, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Now did you know about this? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 232 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   No, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Alright.  So at least on this report 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are asking whether he knew then, 
Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Mr Molefe, so then on the face of this 
report what happened is that whilst you were at the helm of 
Transnet 
there 
was 
large 
scale 
money 
laundering 
10 
happening under your watch using Transnet.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   This money laundering, I mean, it is not a 
finding, is it? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   It is not a finding. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, fair enough. 
MR MOLEFE:   It is not a finding, so …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   I am saying that the Chairperson 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MOLEFE:  So the Chairperson must still apply his mind 
to this evidence.   
ADV MYBURGH:   He must still decide.  That is why I 
specifically said to you on the face of this report. 
MR MOLEFE:   On the face. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 233 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH:   I mean …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what Mr Myburgh is doing, Mr 
Molefe, is he is saying as far as he is concerned when he 
looks at this report. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   It would seem that it suggests that 
during the relevant time and during that relevant time you 
were Group CEO of Transnet there was large scale money 
laundering. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   So – but he wants you in the end to say 
whether you have any comments, I just want to put that in 
context, his proposition in context. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   I agree with your choice of words, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   It would seem so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And so I will wait for the finding, the final 
20 
finding to be made as to whether there was money 
laundering, there was corruption as he says and so on and 
so forth.  Then I will express my opinion at that point.  But 
the Commission is still ongoing, this is part of an 
investigation that is ongoing so let us wait and see what 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 234 of 276 
 
happens in – what comes out of the wash. 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, absolutely and just – I mean, I am 
sure you will appreciate that the Commission is not able to 
make separate findings, you know, in other words it could 
not sign off on this and make a finding of money laundering 
and then we cross-examine you.  Unfortunately – or 
examine you – these processed need to run together. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But I am simply putting to you what – 
certainly it seems to me the money laundering scheme is 
10 
going to advance to the Chairperson. 
MR MOLEFE:   It seems that that is what is going to 
happen. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   So I will wait for the findings to be made 
and then we can take from you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I understand you …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   What I can categorically say now is I have 
no knowledge of these schemes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   And had no part in them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And that from where I was sitting there was 
certainly no wrongdoing on my part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I correct in understanding you to be 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 235 of 276 
 
saying you have no quarrel with the suggestion that if what 
the report says is what happened then it seems that there 
was large scale money laundering? 
MR MOLEFE:   It seems so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems so.  That is good enough, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But before one jumps, you must wait for the 
draft to beat first, the draft will beat when the findings are 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is finding. 
MR MOLEFE:   Before you start dancing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, the idea is this, that when Mr 
Myburgh reads this report, that is what seems to him. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you might read this report and say 
but I do not agree that if this is what happened, it means 
there was [indistinct] 27.14 value, do not read – or you 
might 
even 
say 
no, 
it 
does 
not 
reflect 
any 
money 
laundering …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Or I might even say …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the idea is just to give your own 
20 
perspective. 
MR MOLEFE:   Or I might even say well, it be interesting 
to hear what these people have to say about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   Their right of reply. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 236 of 276 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Because when they do reply, a different 
picture might emerge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   So I would rather hold the horses and say I 
note what it being said, we will wait for the final outcome. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   However, I do – I want to emphasise that in 
as far as my knowledge, my personal knowledge of these 
activities are concerned, I did not know about them and I 
10 
was no involved and I deny any wrongdoing if that is what 
is …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, no, that I appreciate but I suppose 
now you understand the context in which we have concerns 
about what the drivers have to say about senior executives 
having money. 
MR MOLEFE:   What the drivers have to say? 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   What did the drivers say, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH:   We will come to that. 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But you do understand, just so that we – 
before we move on, that on the fact …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but on …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Just hang on, Mr Molefe.  On the face of 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 237 of 276 
 
this report Mr Essa and the Guptas are engaged in money 
laundering. 
MR MOLEFE:   The Guptas …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   In hundreds of millions.  You understand 
that? 
MR MOLEFE:   It seems so. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, I am saying on the face of 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I understand what you say and I also 
understand that you are saying it seems so. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:   No, you are saying it seems so, I am 
saying on the face of the report …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, the Chairperson said [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, but I want to make one point 
…[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   All I said was I like the Chairperson’s 
choice of words. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But I want to …[intervenes] 
MR MOLEFE:   Because we must still wait for the final 
20 
finding. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But there is a – you talked about a 
beating of the drum, this is not silent because one thing I 
want to mention to you is that McKinsey, you know, have 
conceded that all of these contracts were tainted. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 238 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And they have put their money where 
their mouth is, they have agreed to pay back 650 million in 
relation to these contracts and a contract at SAA. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:   That speaks volumes, does it not? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  But let us wait for the final finding 
and in any case, you may well present this to me but it is 
up to the Chairperson …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH:   Yes, I understand that. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:   To make a finding. 
ADV MYBURGH:   Do you want to comment on McKinsey 
having accepted that all the contracts are tainted where 
they worked alongside Regiments and on the basis have 
agreed to pay R650 million. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, I will comment on it. 
ADV MYBURGH:   But you accept they did that. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I mean you heard they did of their 
volition, for their own reasons, I did not see why I 
should...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Well they did it because the 
contracts are tainted, they would not have done that out of 
the goodness of their heart. 
MR MOLEFE:   Maybe they did it out of the goodness of 
their heart. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 239 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe please. 
MR MOLEFE:   [laughing].  Yes, Mr Myburgh, Mr McKinsey 
took a particular line ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   ...of action and all I am saying is I do not 
see a need for me to comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    You see now the importance of 
every time we determine involvement of Mr Essa it 
becomes important, does it not. 
MR MOLEFE:   To you, yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And to the Commission. 
MR MOLEFE:   And to the Commission, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I just wanted to go back and ask 
you this. What I am struggling - and the great irony, I 
suppose insofar as you say you completely innocent is this 
started with you agreeing to Letsema being replaced. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Even the famous case of the guy who 
slipped in the bathroom had a concussion…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Please raise your voice, speak up Mr 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   I say, is it not the case of the guy who 
slipped in the bathroom, had a concussion and then 
somebody rushed him to hospital and then on the way to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 240 of 276 
 
hospital, they had a car accident, and then when they got 
to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    I cannot hear you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I do not think the Chairperson can 
hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I cannot hear you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And you know you must speak to 
him. 
MR MOLEFE:   I am saying to Mr Myburgh is this not the 
case of the guy who slipped in his bathroom, had a 
10 
concussion, was rushed to hospital on the way to hospital, 
he had a car accident, and then when he got to hospital he 
was not attended to and he died. 
So now…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do not know what you are talking 
about. 
MR MOLEFE:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And maybe, let us continue.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yeah, and then what Mr Myburgh is saying, 
but the problem is the concussion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    If at a later stage, you want to - you 
think there is something important about this incident, this 
example, you can come back to it, but let us continue for 
now. 
MR MOLEFE:   But Mr Myburgh understands what I am 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 241 of 276 
 
trying to say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, I do and I mean, that I need to 
put to you that it started with a decision…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is it somehow like the man who walks 
next to the goats? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I think it is, too close to the goats.  
CHAIRPERSON:    To close to the goats but he is not 
stealing them.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I think what is important and again, 
now I am being - in fairness to you I suppose whether you 
10 
walked too close to the goats or whether you were 
complicit, cannot be determined on a decision by decision 
basis.  So you cannot say, well, let us say you know, I 
knew something about a crocodile and I did not do 
anything wrong.  
What we going to, have to do at the end of your 
evidence is tally all of these things up and then ask the 
question.  Did you really not know, were they too smart for 
you, were you asleep at the wheel or were you complicit? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    We have to decide that on all of the 
facts. 
MR MOLEFE:   I have, I have not - I have no problem in 
you deciding that as long as it is based on evidence.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Absolutely.  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 242 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, so let us see if - could I just 
take you perhaps for the sake of completion to page 403 of 
the same bundle, bundle 5.  There is a media statement 
released by the Chairperson, you have read this I take it, 
403.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Have you read this statement 
before? MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And perhaps paragraph 1 captures 
10 
it.  
“McKinsey worked alongside Regiments Capital at 
Transnet and SAA on contracts that had been 
investigated by the Commission.  The Commission 
recently initiated discussions with McKinsey is now 
pleased to announce that McKinsey has undertaken 
to repay all of the fees paid to it for work it 
performed on the Transnet and SAA contracts, 
alongside 
Regiment. 
 The 
amount 
covered 
by 
McKinsey is undertaking has not yet been fixed with 
20 
Transnet and SAA but is likely to be around 
R650million.” 
You see that?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I just want to go back before we go 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 243 of 276 
 
forward.  Did you, when Transnet agreed that Letsema be 
replaced by Regiments and that was a big change, not so.  
Regiments, sorry Letsema to Regiments because if you 
look at it in the context of the contract, they were 
effectively a 30% partner, it is a big change, to move from 
one SD partner to another, not so? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, the change that in which I was involved 
was to say that Regiments must find another partner. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But it is a big change.  
MR MOLEFE:   No, that was not a big change. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No it was because…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   The big change for me after everything that 
was said is when the deals that you are talk about were 
made. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Oh, yes, absolutely.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yeah, that was the big change. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Ja, because must speak about the 
money, I know. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yeah, but just saying that Regiments must 
replace Letsema and just leaving it there. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But Mr Molefe…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   I think was not a big change.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No, okay well, perhaps I need to 
finalise it. 
MR MOLEFE:   So it what on the actual, not even the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 244 of 276 
 
replacement that happened, but the deals that you now 
described, happened down the line, where actually the big 
change happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, no I think perhaps we at cross 
purposes, the replacement of Letsema with Regiments was 
a material change to the McKinsey Consortium. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, but you must remember that my 
involvement was where not even the replacement.  It was 
to say that Letsema needs to be replaced because of the 
conflict of interest.  But it was unfortunate that here that 
10 
conflict is not properly captured, because, as I remember, 
it was because Barloworld is likely to be a bidder.   
But I will go and investigate this overnight about 
why Letsema was - there was a recommendation that I 
agreed with that Letsema must be replaced.  But the big 
change for me in listening to this story is when the deals 
that you are talking about, about sharing of the partners, 
and so on are concerned, that is where the bid is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    You did not know about that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I did not know about that. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Because you and I are at cross 
purposes I am afraid.  Can I just take you and see if we 
can cut through this for the purposes of moving on, can I 
ask you to go I think for the first time to bundle 6, to 
exhibit 27. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 245 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Are you there?  I want to take you 
towards the end of the file to page 380, three eight zero. 
MR MOLEFE:   What was that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I think you might have the wrong 
file. This is one of the two Mr Molefe that I gave you this 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, it is a file that should be in front of 
you one of the files in front of you, it should say Transnet 
bundle 5, 306, Transnet 06.  It is a smaller file I think, 
10 
Transnet bundle 06.  What about the green one, that green 
one that you have in front of you?  
MR MOLEFE:   The green one that is mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh it looks like – oh I thought they were 
finding it somewhere else, Transnet bundle 06. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    With your leave Mr Chairman, we 
will find that file because I know that I gave it to Mr Molefe 
because I gave it this morning, but there are lots of files.  
My junior has another copy of this bundle perhaps for the 
sake of speeding things up. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, Mr Molefe they will give you 
another file.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, so are you at page 380? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And you are familiar with the fact 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 246 of 276 
 
that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    You want to give Mr Molefe sanitizer, 
have you got sanitizer there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did they give it to you, will you be fine? 
Okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright, so Mr Molefe you familiar 
with these reports, in this bundle?  
MR MOLEFE:    Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    This page 380, you see at 
10 
paragraph 2.4, there is the heading, the letter of intent 
related 6 December, we have spoken about that.  I am 
going to take you if I may to paragraph 2.4.5 and Mr 
Molefe you will also in, fairness to you I point out that 
these 
reports, 
of 
course, 
are 
not 
binding 
on 
the 
Chairperson.  They are just opinions of a particular entity.  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But I will take you to it so that I can 
get you to comment on the propositions that I want to 
make. It says at 2.4.5: 
20 
“Pursuant 
to 
the 
approval 
by 
Mr 
Molefe 
that 
McKinsey partner with another service provider 
Regiments was included as a member of the 
McKinsey Consortium despite not having properly 
tendered as part of the McKinsey Consortium.” 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 247 of 276 
 
2.4.6: 
“The appearance of Regiments name as a member 
of the McKinsey Consortium and accordingly a 
service provider to Transnet at this stage of the 
procurement process was irregular for the following 
reasons.”   
Sub-one: 
“Regiments was not a member of the McKinsey 
Consortium when it submitted its proposal to the 
1064 transaction advisor tender.” 
10 
Sub-two: 
“The 1064 transaction advisor tender was awarded 
by the TAC to the McKinsey Consortium based on 
its stated composition at the time of the submission 
of its proposal.  The capabilities of the McKinsey 
Consortium members to perform the various aspects 
of 
the 
1064 
transaction 
advisory 
tender 
and 
accordingly, the McKinsey Consortium eligibility for 
the award was assessed based on the verification 
and evaluation of the claims made by its constituent 
20 
members of which Regiments was not one.” 
Sub-three: 
“Transnet has a statutory duty to ensure that when 
it contracts for goods and services it does so in 
accordance with the system that is fair, equitable, 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 248 of 276 
 
transparent, competitive and cost effective. It is this 
then when Transnet has in place a PPM which 
states inter alia that all procurement with Transnet 
shall be done in line with these procedures.  The 
inclusion 
of 
Regiments 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Consortium was not transparent, competitive and 
ultimately not in accordance with any of the PPM 
stipulated procurement path.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Sub-seven: 
10 
“It is apparent from the inclusion of Regiments as a 
member of the McKinsey Consortium in the LOI that 
after the adjudication and award of the tender by 
Transnet the McKinsey Consortium was permitted to 
change its composition and to introduce a new 
member.  This regiments, as such, the capabilities 
and 
other 
credentials 
of 
Regiments 
were 
not 
subjected to the rigor of the verification evaluation 
and adjudication process inherent in any tender 
process.” 
20 
Now, do you want to comment on that?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, Chairperson, as you see, in 2.4.5 it 
says:  
“This went to the approval by Mr B Molefe by 
McKinsey to partner with another service provider.” 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 249 of 276 
 
That is, where I was involved, that they should partner with 
other service providers.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Then after that, what you presented was an 
agreement between McKinsey and partner by Mr Singh that 
that partner would be, and then I asked when that contract 
was presented here, that this contract must have been 
preceded by a name, I did ask at the time.   
I do not know if you remember, I said the way that 
we did things for Mr Singh to sign a contract like this there 
10 
must have been a memo that explains the background to 
this, to sign this contract. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr, Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   And at the time, I said, I would be 
interested to see that memo, what that memo said about 
Regiments and what really the reasons behind this is, and 
then I think he said, no, we do not have the memo we just 
have the agreement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But why I laugh is no one is going 
to record what happened, I have told you what happened.  
20 
It is large scale criminal activity.  
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    The meeting was called, and 
Regiments were told, we will appoint you but then you must 
pay Essa 30% of the fee.  That is not going to find its way 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 250 of 276 
 
into a memorandum.  
MR MOLEFE:   But at Transnet for Mr Singh to sign a 
contract like that, he needed a memo. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Well, let us see what Mr Singh says 
but let me ask you this question.  Where was Regiments 
subjected to verification, evaluation and adjudication? 
MR MOLEFE:    But that memo would say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No, that is not what happened.  
What the fact show is you decided that Letsema should be 
replaced. It opened the door for McKinsey to choose 
10 
whoever they wanted, that was your decision.  Why did you 
not say that whoever you choose as a replacement for 
Letsema has to be subjected to the same verification 
evaluation and adjudication process, why did you not do 
that?  
MR MOLEFE:   That is why I am curious to see if Mr 
Singh's signing of that contract was preceded by a memo 
written in what I always call at Transnet English, which 
explains why 
we are taking a decision.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Why did you not provide when you 
took the decision that Regiments had to be subject to the 
same verification, evaluation and adjudication process as 
Letsema?  Why did you not provide for that in your 
decision? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 251 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   You mean, why was that not recommended 
to me? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    You also had to apply your mind Mr 
Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, I was not saying who should replace 
Letsema, I was not involved.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    That is not what I am asking. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let us, maybe let us…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   So the letter will mean, where Letsema 
must be replaced. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let us come – let just look at it from 
this angle, do you accept as you sit there today or do you 
not accept that it would have been irregular for Regiments 
to be brought in, in that fashion without being subjected to 
that process of verification, you accept that? 
MR MOLEFE:   I do, Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay alright. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which is why I am asking.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR MOLEFE:   Mr Anoj Singh's signature of that contract 
20 
was it preceded by name because that memo would have 
outlined the process that was followed or not followed.  It 
is actually in assessing the contents of that memo, if it 
exists. That would tell us exactly what happened and what 
the reasons were, yes. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 252 of 276 
 
But unfortunately, because I did not sign that 
contract, I did not see that but what I am saying to the 
Commission, if you really, really want to get to the bottom 
of our arrangement or Mr Singh has got to sign that 
agreement. There must have been a memo unless Mr Singh 
comes here and says, no, I signed but there was no name. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay but as you sit there looking at 
this, and accepting that it would have been irregular for 
Regiments to be included without going through this 
verification process.  
10 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Are you leaving out what might be found 
if there is a memo and Mr Myburgh has already said that I 
think it is unlikely there would be any memo, leaving that 
aside, can you think of any reason why it would have been 
justified 
to 
include 
Regiments 
without 
subjecting 
Regiments 
to 
that 
process 
that 
Letsema 
had 
been 
subjected to? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yeah, no, I cannot think of any. 
ADV MOTSEPE SC:    Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV MOTSEPE SC:    I would imagine this is one of the 
documents that were received last night, and if that is the 
position, I think Mr Molefe should be granted…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Your voice is lowered. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 253 of 276 
 
ADV MOTSEPE SC:    I was saying Chair this is one of the 
documents that has been received last night and if that is 
the case, Mr Molefe can be given an opportunity to look at 
this document overnight.  
CHAIRPERSON:    To get? 
ADV MOTSEPE SC:    Mr Molefe can be given an 
opportunity to look at this document overnight if this is one 
of the documents that we received last night, especially 
those documents were delayed and others. 
MR MOLEFE:    Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   The contract what I will do tonight is 
provide to the Commission and investigate if Mr Anoj 
Singh’s entering into a contract was ceded by a memo.  Let 
us find out if there was a memo and get hold of that memo.  
Failing which perhaps it can be explained what the process 
was. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   But we said I am not in a position to 
comment on that, because I also want to understand what 
20 
the process was. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, no that is fine, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
 
Yes, 
thank 
you, 
so 
you 
see…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    And Mr Singh is coming, of course. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 254 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, Mr Singh is coming, he will no 
doubt deal with the questions that you have left for him 
and that I have got for him, too.  But Mr Molefe you see 
what the facts show is that Regiments actually became 
involved 
without 
any 
adjudication 
or 
evaluation 
or 
verification of them certainly not by Transnet, so just to let 
you…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Unless if we find the memo that explains 
that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe it does not help you to 
10 
say unless you can find a memo, the Commission has 
investigated this matter.  This is evidence that has been 
dealt with.  I am taking it to the MNS Report, they also 
investigated matters.  You cannot every time when faced 
with a difficult question, say that there must be a memo 
somewhere.  I mean, just so that you understand, on the 
face of it…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:    The problem with your difficult questions, 
Mr Myburgh is that they are questions that did not involve 
anything that I did. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Right, you know…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Because I can explain my actions.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But you were involved here directly 
you said…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no I said I was involved up to the point 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 255 of 276 
 
where Letsema had to be replaced.  I did not - I was not 
involved in the replacement of Letsema and all I am saying 
is in the replacement of Letsema was there memo that was 
written. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No, there was not, not on our 
investigation and research. 
MR MOLEFE:   Was the definitely not, I mean, was 
Transnet asked for that memo? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe if there was one, then we 
would have put it up.   
10 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I mean, I cannot swear that there is 
not one, but the point is, if you could just deal with this, 
why did you not apply your mind and say we cannot let 
McKinsey just replace Letsema with whoever they want? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Regiments. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yeah, you.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Why did you not provide for some 
evaluation process?  That is really all I am asking, the 
20 
decision and it is a decision that you took. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, Chair that I am prepared to concede.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   But maybe when we replaced, when we said 
Letsema must be replaced we should have also talked 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 256 of 276 
 
about a process to find the replacement.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   We did not talk about the process.  
However, I am curious to see even in the absence of 
stating that there must be a process, what was followed?  
What was the process?  
CHAIRPERSON:    Would it be correct to say you are keen 
to find this out because on your own understanding it 
would have been irregular for Regimens to be included 
without going through the process, so you are keen to find 
10 
out what justification may have been put up? 
MR MOLEFE:   It would have been odd. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Alright, Mr Myburgh.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Thank you.  So let us then move on. 
So that was a conflict that arose, Letsema we know is 
ultimately replaced by Regiments.  That happens between 
August and December that is 2012.  Now do you remember 
that a year later, in about November 2013 Regiments then 
20 
replaced Nedbank, due to another conflict of interest. 
MR MOLEFE:   I seem to recall that vaguely. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    November 2013. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I recall - let me just say I remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Okay, well, perhaps tomorrow I will 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 257 of 276 
 
give you a copy of the letter because I have it in Mr 
Singh's file, but for the moment…[intervene] 
MR MOLEFE:   Did Mr Singh sign the letter? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, he did.  So do you recall 
Regiments replacing Nedbank? 
MR MOLEFE:   Vaguely Chair, I have no recollection of the 
detail.  But once again, there would have been a memo and 
I am quite happy to look at the memo, and look because 
that is what the discipline that we had instilled was that 
every action must be accompanied by a memo that explains 
10 
in English, exactly what is happening. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Well, perhaps Mr Singh was not as 
rigorous in the memo process as you were.  He signs the 
letter – but let me give you a copy tomorrow. 
MR MOLEFE:   Of the letter? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Ja. 
MR MOLEFE:   And the memo that precedes the letter if 
there is.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Now…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Must I take volume 6, bundle 6 away or 
20 
you still needed? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I think, yes, I think you could.  
Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, I have limited space here so I 
have to keep an eye on how many files I keep here. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 258 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Or sorry, I had I put the file safely here on 
the chair, that I could not find. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   No, that file that was missing…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    You have found it. 
MR MOLEFE:    It was here on my chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, okay. 
MR MOLEFE:   I put it away, but now I forgot it was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe look, I am going to give 
10 
you 
this 
letter 
and 
obviously 
the 
Chairperson 
a 
letter…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry, Mr Myburgh maybe now that 
you have discovered that you have got it there, maybe the 
one that was lent to you should go, so that you do not end 
up. 
MR MOLEFE:    Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, it should be returned to whence it 
came from. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Mr Molefe just so that we locate 
20 
ourselves I will give you the letter overnight, but dated the 
19 t h of November 2013, signed by Mr Singh, paragraph 3: 
“In May 2013, a potential conflict of interest was 
raised with McKinsey…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do I have that? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 259 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    No, you do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do not, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I am going to provide it overnight. 
MR MOLEFE:   What was the date of the letter? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    19 November 2013: 
“In May 2013, a potential conflict of interest was 
raised with McKinsey concerning Nedbank, to which 
a response from McKinsey confirmed the conflict 
and an alternative solution to provide the services 
to Transnet was proposed in terms of Regiments 
10 
Capital to provide the services.” 
Paragraph 6: 
“This letter says Mr Singh, serves to confirm 
Transnet’s agreement to McKinsey's request that 
Regiments Capital to provide the required services 
in place of Nedbank.” 
Do you see what has happened there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but I can confirm that was not 
discussed with me.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Sorry? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I can confirm that that was not discussed 
with me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes, because it was another big and 
important change, and you see how Regiments now 
becomes more dominant, not, so? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 260 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And of course, as it became more 
dominant, it charged more fees and the more the money 
laundering grew.  That is what you see from the money 
flows report, not so? 
MR MOLEFE:   I cannot comment on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But you understand – do you see 
what was happening here.  
MR MOLEFE:   Hey? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Do you see what was happening 
10 
here? 
MR MOLEFE:   But I cannot comment on it because as I 
say, I was not involved in it.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But do you understand now, that 
one's got to track Regimens, one must track carefully the 
decisions that were taken that enabled Regiments to come 
on the scene.  One must track carefully every extension of 
the scope of Regiments work, is that no so? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but…intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Do you accept that? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   Mr. Myburgh I said to you that the way that 
I understood the system to work was that every single 
decision has to be carefully explained in a memo.  Now in 
the absence of these memos, I mean, I do not know what 
the memos will say when we find them. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 261 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Here is Mr Singh's letter Mr Molefe. 
MR MOLEFE:   No, no the letter before you write a letter 
and make a decision like that or become involved in it 
there has to be a memo, that is how we operated and in 
the absence of a memo, I would really want to know why 
was it not properly explained. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    That’s exactly the question that we 
are asking. 
MR MOLEFE:   In English?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes precisely, but what you said 
10 
now, which is important is that you knew nothing about 
this, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.     
MR MOLEFE:   But I would also be curious to see if that 
decision as properly documented. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And what you also accept I suppose 
is every single contract which is concluded with Regiments 
must also come under microscope, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what we are going to see is – do 
you remember how many contracts you signed or tender 
confinements you signed in favour of Regiments, many?     
MR MOLEFE:   No I don’t remember. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come to them.    
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 262 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact ...[intervenes]      
MR MOLEFE:   And when you do bring them with their 
memo’s. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Here in these bundles the document 
that there are.     
MR MOLEFE:   Yes, okay no that’s fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And maybe unwittingly that you 
have seen from the money flows reports those contracts 
generated 
massive 
money 
laundering 
payments, 
the 
10 
contracts that you signed, do you understand how one has 
to look at this carefully now under the microscope, Mr 
Molefe, you understand that? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    And one is really only able to draw 
conclusions at the end, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    So let us then – just before I move 
on, you did know, as I understand your evidence, that 
Regiments, having replaced Letsema also went on to 
20 
replace Nedbank, you knew that happened, but as I 
understand it you didn’t have anything to do with the 
decision.   
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I can’t recall the detail or the – I 
remember that vaguely, ja, but I cannot recall the detail. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 263 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Can you think why Mr Singh 
wouldn’t have engaged you over this decision because he 
certainly engaged you over the decision to replace – to 
have Letsema replaced. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which is why want to see the memo. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    But you see it is a phantom 
defence. 
MR MOLEFE:    No, no, no it was – I don’t know 2013 is 
eight years ago, a lot of things have happened in eight 
years, I do remember this vaguely but I can’t, I need my 
10 
memory 
to 
be 
jogged, 
especially 
that 
some 
of 
the 
documents arrived last night, I really need to apply my 
mind and try to recall properly what happened.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Okay, alright, so now we have got 
to November 2013, I am just following the chronology 
tracking this 1064 advisory contract.  There then came a 
time you may recall when McKinsey ceded its rights and 
obligations to Regiments, do you remember, on the 1064 
contract. 
 
So just look at the steps, Letsema is replaced by 
20 
Regiments, Regiments then replace Nedbank, McKinsey 
then cedes the contract to Regiments.  Regiments now 
becomes the primary contractor, correct? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In circumstances where there has 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 264 of 276 
 
been absolutely no verification, evaluation or assessment 
of it.     
MR MOLEFE:   Where are the documents? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without having won any tender. 
MR MOLEFE:   Come again sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And without having won any tender. 
MR MOLEFE:   Without having won any tender yes.    
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MOLEFE:   But where are the documents. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Well that’s one of the new 
10 
documents from last night, so I just want to place that on 
record, but let’s go to that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is like – I am sorry Mr Myburgh – 
so it is like Mr Molefe Regiments comes in and says no I 
just want – I will just take a hand, then after some time it 
says I want the whole arm, and then later on it says no I 
am 
taking 
over 
everything, 
when 
then 
McKinsey 
...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:  Were they taking over or were they being 
given.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MOLEFE:   Were they taking over or were they being 
given? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I don’t know if there is a difference, but 
ultimately they would take the position of the main 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 265 of 276 
 
contractor. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When in fact they were not even there at 
the beginning. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Slowly they come in, then they want 
more, and then ultimately maybe somebody might say they 
push McKinsey out and take over, but maybe it is not 
pushing out, but they take over in the end. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Yes thank you.   Could I ask you 
please to go to Exhibit BB3[a], and if you could then turn 
to page – the numbers at the top, the MSM numbers, 
MSM175.  Are you there? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is a letter by Mr Segar from 
McKinsey to Mr Singh, dated the 16 t h of April and it reads: 
“Pursuant to our discussion and agreement on 5 
February we have now confirmed that the mandate 
20 
awarded to McKinsey Incorporated all rights and 
obligations created thereby was on 5 February 
ceded and delegated to Regiments Capital.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see that? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 266 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see how it grew. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but could this be done legally? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come to that 
because this is where you become directly involved, I am 
not suggesting necessarily that this is illegal, but what we 
know 
is 
that 
Regiments 
were 
conducting 
themselves 
illegally, they were siphoning funds from your business.  
Do you understand what happened here Mr Molefe? 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, but – no, no McKinsey is ceding its 
10 
right to the contract ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know and I am going to put  
parts of the McKinsey’s evidence to you,  You see this was 
around the time where the contract, the 1064 contract was 
coming to fruition and McKinsey in fact walked away from 
this, and they were replaced by Regiments and in this time 
they then came back subsequently.    
MR MOLEFE:   So they were ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just bear with me. 
MR MOLEFE:   They were coerced into doing this? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just bear with me for a moment. It 
was in this time between McKinsey leaving and when they 
came back that there was this massive increase in the ETC 
for the 1064 locomotives. 
MR MOLEFE:   What increase? 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 267 of 276 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MOLEFE:   What increase? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The ETC. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The ETC.   Let’s come to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have forgotten the abbreviation what it 
stands for. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The estimated total cost. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, that was not an increase, but we will 
get to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So just tracking this so here 
10 
we see 16 April McKinsey are saying look I have ceded 
rights and obligations, they are out in relation to the 1064 
advisory contract, do you follow?  Regiment is now the 
dominant entity, correct?  
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay so let’s then have a look at 
your – now go please back to your file, Bundle 5, page 
405.7.  This is also a letter that you received or memo that 
you received recently, you are more than welcome to take 
time to look at it more carefully.   
20 
MR MOLEFE:   So this is what we got yesterday? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, 405.7. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now this incidentally, remember the 
McKinsey letter is dated the 16 t h of April, this is a 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 268 of 276 
 
memorandum to you from Mr Singh, if you go to page 
405.15.  You will see that he sends it to you on the same 
day, 16.04.14, do you see that?  Do you see that?  Mr 
Molefe?    
MR MOLEFE:   What did you want me to see? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He is asking whether you can see on 
page 405.15 that Mr Anoj Singh signed this memorandum 
on the same day, namely 16.04.14, same day as the letter 
that McKinsey sent to Regiments. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and if you have a look at the 
10 
recommendation. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sub-line “note the deliverables 
executed by the transaction advisor on the locomotive 
transaction compared to the original scope...” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “...ratify the amendment in the 
allocation of scope of work from McKinsey to Regiments 
Capital.” 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “3.  Ratify the amendment in the 
makeup 
of 
the 
transaction 
advisor 
consortium 
from 
Nedbank Capital with Regiments Capital.”    
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    “Now the proven change in the 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 269 of 276 
 
remuneration model of the transaction advisor compared to 
the original remuneration model.”  Right?   
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Delegation power to the GCFO to 
give effect to the above proposal, right? 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And now the fees? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Add to the above approvals.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon, approvals, thank 
you.  And the fees you see in the table above they were 
10 
originally it would seem about 50million, what were they 
now?  What were their anticipated fees? 
MR MOLEFE:   Chairperson and Mr Myburgh you know 
what you are doing is really unfair, this was given to me 
yesterday, last night.  We got it last night.   Now you can’t 
take a document that we received last night and just go to 
the end of the document and say do you see what is the 
recommended fee.  What does the body of the document 
say?   Now as we were talking ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Molefe, hang on, hang, hang 
20 
on, so we don’t waste time.  As I understand it the 
arrangement that has been reached between Mr Myburgh 
and yourself and your counsel is that in regard to the 
documents that you received last night Mr Myburgh would 
ask questions, but you have a right to say I am not able to 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 270 of 276 
 
answer questions on this document because I need more 
time and that will be respected, so that is the arrangement, 
and all you need to say is look I need to have more time on 
this document and then that will be – nobody has forced 
you to answer questions on documents where you need 
time that you received last night. 
MR MOLEFE:   But Chair even if I am not forced why put 
me in that position in the first place, because if you look at 
page 
40512, 
because 
I 
just 
skimmed 
through 
this 
document, it talks about value paid in by the advisor, it 
10 
says 00512 impact on Transnet, change remuneration 
model for a transactional riser, and that is written in 
English and it goes through general amendment principles, 
budget implication, but Mr Myburgh’s question is going 
right to the end and saying can you see that 50million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are free to say look I need 
to have time to do this and that will be accepted. 
MR MOLEFE:   I do Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so you want to leave it 
20 
there? 
MR MOLEFE:   I would like to leave it, it was given last 
night and it is not just a matter of going to the conclusion 
and saying Mr Molefe can you see your culpability there.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 271 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   That’s what you said you see this is where 
your involvement is ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Molefe ...[intervenes]  
MR MOLEFE:   See that 50million. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
I 
think 
the 
Chairperson 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But we are going to waste time now.  Mr 
Molefe you said you need more time, that is accepted. 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps what I should also then do 
is point out to you what other documents are contained 
here, you will see that there’s a whole lot of CIPRO reports 
towards the end, not much reliance will be made on them 
other than pointing to a name or two, so could you go 
through all of them overnight and then we will come back 
to this memo and we are going to come back to the first 
one. 
MR MOLEFE:   Which ones? 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
These 
documents, 
the 
405 
20 
collection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might wish to make a note Mr ... – 
you might wish to make a note of the documents he would 
like you to look at overnight. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The documents that you were given 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 272 of 276 
 
last night are all the 405 documents, from 40591 to 40595.   
You will remember that I asked you questions about the 
memo at 405.1 we are going to come back to that, and 
...[intervenes]   
MR MOLEFE:  405?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   405.1. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, 2, 4, 5? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To 405.6. 
MR MOLEFE:   .6. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this is the second document that 
10 
we will come back to, tomorrow. 405.7 and it is a long 
document that goes on. 
MR MOLEFE:   Chair when will we return to these 
documents? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it is tomorrow. 
MR MOLEFE:   No Chair, I will go through them and I will 
take legal advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that’s fine. 
MR MOLEFE:   So I am afraid it will not happen overnight. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
20 
MR MOLEFE:   I am afraid it will not happen overnight. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the studying of the documents will 
happen overnight but you say before you – you will get a 
chance to ...[intervenes]  
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 273 of 276 
 
MR MOLEFE:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, alright.  Let us then 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well isn’t the position that – just one sec 
– isn’t the position that it is better that you look at all the 
documents that you got last night in respect of which you 
haven’t had time to reflect, just so that we don’t have a 
situation where later on you might say well I looked at only 
the documents that were mentioned but I didn’t look at the 
others that I also got. 
10 
MR MOLEFE:    Yes, all the documents that were 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Received last night? 
MR MOLEFE;   Ja.  You see the thing about the documents 
that were received last night some of them we had, some 
of them we had, so skimming through them it is difficult to 
say because now you see this one we have, this one eish I 
am not sure, and so on, and it is not possible to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there was not enough time compare 
20 
and check. 
MR MOLEFE:   Ja, I had this about half past seven on 
Sunday night. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that is fair enough. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I just also indicate that from 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 274 of 276 
 
page 405.28 all the way to 405.95, so it is the bulk of the 
documents these are two CIPRO reports Chairperson 
where we will indicate to Molefe when we adjourn what we 
are using them for, it is really just a matter of showing that 
X person was a director and Y person was a director, there 
is a lot of paper here but it involves actually only two 
names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MOTSEPE:   Thanks Chair.  I have just been 
instructed by my instructing attorney that we will have to 
10 
consult with Mr Molefe and thereafter only 
make a 
determination whether he will be ready tomorrow to testify 
on these documents because as he has just indicated I 
only received them last night at ten o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine. 
MR MOTSEPE:   So we will liaise with the evidence leader 
to indicate whether we will be ready tomorrow or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I think subject to what the 
position will be when we adjourn the idea would be that Mr 
Molefe comes back tomorrow and if there is going to be a 
20 
request for the adjournment of the hearing of his evidence 
or the adjournment of the hearing of his evidence in regard 
to certain issues then we can deal with it at that stage.  
Okay, alright, it is one minute past six, I think every two 
hours we should just have a short adjournment.   Let us 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 275 of 276 
 
have an adjournment, unless – your estimate is that we are 
still going to take some time?   I don’t know how the 
documents that you can’t ask Mr Molefe about affect the 
time that you needed for today. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson it would obviously be 
preferable to deal with those documents and get them out 
of the way, because as you have seen what I am trying to 
do, and I hope that it is helpful to you and the witness, is 
to build the chronology and see how this particular contract 
unfolded, so I am happy to go back to the documents, but 
10 
it is not first price.   
 
The other thing that strikes me is if we work too late 
then no doubt Mr Molefe is going to say he didn’t have an 
opportunity to look at the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you are right, so maybe we 
should adjourn now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we should adjourn now so Mr 
Molefe gets enough time to look at the documents and talk 
to his legal team, and then also because you say it is 
20 
important for you if possible to deal with the documents 
before you move on because of the chronology that you 
want to deal with. 
 
So let us adjourn now, and then resume at ten 
tomorrow.  I have that other application at half past nine, I 
08 MARCH 2021 – DAY 356 
 
Page 276 of 276 
 
don’t know if you have had an opportunity ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes I did have a look at it briefly 
Chairperson, we don’t intend to say anything in response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  Okay we are going 
to adjourn now.  In regard to Mr Molefe’s evidence will 
resume at ten tomorrow, in regard to the other application 
of Mr Gama, that will be at half past nine tomorrow 
morning. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
