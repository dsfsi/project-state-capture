PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 09 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Tsotsi the oath you took yesterday will 
continue to apply today. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thanks Chairman the exercise I was given 
yesterday had something to do with my lack of sleep so if I 
doze off during this please excuse me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is alright.  I am sure Mr Seleka 
10 
will make sure he keeps you awake.  There is one question 
that I did not ask you yesterday which I want to ask you 
before Mr Seleka proceeds.  When Mr Tony Gupta said to 
you that they put you – they are the ones who put you into 
this position and they can take you out of the position.  
Why did you not ask him how did you put me into this 
position?  What are you talking about?  I do not know that 
you put me into this position. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is a valid question Chairman.  At the 
time I was in the state of the mind that I was quite upset 
20 
from the previous meeting I had with the Minister and I just 
saw a conspiracy looming and so by the time I got to him I 
was basically fed up and I just wanted to get away.  So I 
did not have the presence of mind to ask him.  And I really 
did not want to entertain any discussion with him having… 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 4 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well we may get to a point where we 
might have more discussion about allegations that the 
Gupta’s put up names of people that they wanted to be 
appointed to boards of SOE’s and in certain government 
departments, certain strategic positions we might get to 
the point where we discuss that.   
But I just thought that it was interesting that he said 
that to you because from the way you say he said it he – 
10 
he seemed – he seemed to think that they had – they were 
responsible for you being the Chairperson.  Maybe they did 
not but he wanted you to realise that maybe to think he 
had a lot of power or they had a lot of power.   
But from your point – from your side your evidence 
was at least in regard to your first term you had not shown 
any interest of wanting to be a Member of the Board of 
Eskom you were just approached and to ask whether you 
would be interested and you supplied your CV and in due 
course you were appointed.    
20 
So – so one just wonders whether without you 
knowing it may be that you were identified as somebody 
that they would like to get onto the board in the belief on 
their part that maybe you would do whatever they might 
want you to do and maybe you were got rid of ultimately 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 5 of 220 
 
maybe because you did not prove to be what they wanted.  
So – so you see the thinking. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But it is just that these allegations 
are there that they were influential trying to put people that 
they wanted in certain positions for their own purposes. 
MR TSOTSI:  In fact, Chairman you speaking about their 
demonstration of their power you just reminded me of 
something which I omitted to mention.  It just occurred to 
me now as you were speaking. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  In one of those visits when I was at 
Saxonwold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  At their residence what happened is that 
Tony Gupta produced something.  He said I want you to 
look at something but I cannot give it to you.  I said okay 
what is that?  He showed transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Of I think it was a sms or messages in any 
20 
case, telephone messages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And these were conversations amongst the 
Board – my Board Members who at the time – this is now 
the previous board before the new board. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 6 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  They happened to have a sms or a whatsapp 
group. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  That they were – they used to talk about the 
business of the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  I was not part of that group but he then 
shows me and I read this and I see that you know it is a 
discussion by all the various Board Members. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Well I would say maybe about half of the 
board maybe three quarters of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And I was quite taken aback.  I said, where 
do you get this from?  He said do not worry about that 
Chairman that is – do not worry about it I just wanted to let 
you know that we have got our own sources. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  So I took this to be kind of a power play. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  He says, listen if you mess with me this is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I will find out if you – whatever what 
you say some people will tell me or whatever you do. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 7 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will tell me. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is quite an important piece of 
information.  And you say that the whats – the members of 
the 
whatsapp 
group 
that 
were 
taking 
part 
in 
that 
conversation it was about half the board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes it was about half or just maybe two thirds 
of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite significant.  I know I have 
read a report of some investigation I do not know if it is the 
Fundudzi Report which said their investigations revealed 
that at a certain time and I cannot remember which year – 
at a certain time a number of board members at Eskom and 
Transnet I think and Denel were people who seemed to 
have some or other association with the Gupta’s and in 
regard to some that report reflected that their CV’s had 
gone to the Department of Public Enterprises the office of 
the Minister through a Gupta related email address.   
20 
And I think that – that – either that report or 
another one also linked at a certain time most of the 
members of the Denel board as associated in one way or 
another with the Gupta’s.   
So – so it is all of these things that make one think 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 8 of 220 
 
when you hear statements like we are the ones who put 
you there we can take you out.  You know or something like 
that.  Ja.  Okay thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
maybe we should go into that point before we move away 
from it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because Mr Tsotsi deals with a part of 
10 
it already in his affidavit.  Mr Tsotsi that is on page 25 of 
your affidavit.  It starts on page 25 under the heading 
Salim Essa.  Although what you do there is to deal with the 
composition of the sub-committees.  Are you there on page 
25 on paragraph 20 – under paragraph 20.  You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
“So my first encounter with Mr Essa was at 
one of the TNA breakfasts.” 
 
So that is the first encounter.  You turn the page – 
20 
page 26 paragraph 20.3 and there you say: 
“The other occasion was when the new 
board came into being where I was required 
to place board members in sub-committees 
of the board.  Salim Essa sent me his 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 9 of 220 
 
configuration and asked that I pass it onto 
the Minister as my submission.” 
 
Well 
this 
is 
about 
the 
sub-committees. 
 
The 
Chairperson was specifically asking about the board itself.  
So your affidavit deals with the composition of the sub-
committees but maybe it is related.  Let us hear how you 
deal with it.  20.4 then says: 
“I quietly ignored his submission and sent 
mine to the Minister whereupon the Minister 
responded with the exact submission I had 
10 
received from Salim Essa.  I kept going 
back and forth with this process of chopping 
and 
changing 
the 
allocations 
with 
the 
Minister until she called me to a meeting.  
At the meeting was Salim Essa and Tony 
Gupta.  She merely informed me that the 
board allocations will be the way she had 
sent to me.  This she did in the presence of 
these two gentlemen.” 
Then you go on to say: 
20 
“I did not know whether – I did not know if 
Mr 
Essa 
had 
any 
involvement 
in 
my 
resignation from the board.  Mr Essa was 
never present at any of the meetings I had 
with Tony Gupta.” 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 10 of 220 
 
 
Now I believe that this aspect did come up on the 
first 
occasion 
that 
you 
testified 
here 
before 
this 
commission and that the Chairperson asked you whether 
you have that submission – a copy of that submission 
given to you by Mr Essa and your submission to the 
Minister and the Minister ’s submission to you.  Do you 
recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And can you recall whether you do have 
copies of those submissions? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  No I do not have them – I never had them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No what you mean you never had? 
MR TSOTSI:  No I am talking about… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you receive them. 
MR TSOTSI:  I am talking about the last time I was here I 
did not – I had not had them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you try to get them after the last time 
or was this – was it a situation where you could not really 
try – you would have no idea where to start because of the 
20 
lapse of time? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I remember when – when I left, we had 
agreed I would make an attempt to try to get them or at 
least get some information that would corroborate what I 
was saying.  I tried to get them through Eskom but I was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 11 of 220 
 
not successful.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And the people who were working with me at 
the time they do not have any – they did not have any of 
these – of the material.  Nor did they have any sight of 
what I had done.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Would the – would you have 
received them those that you received from both Mr Essa 
and the Minister would you have received them through 
your personal laptop computer or it would have been an 
10 
Eskom computer and those that you sent to the Minister?  
Do you know? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well my recollection is that it was an Eskom 
email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An Eskom computer. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. Well I do not 
know Mr Seleka somebody might – you might wish to talk 
to investigators. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know sometimes they have ways of 
unearthing documents that you do not think can be found.  
So that should be tried. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 12 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will certainly do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I – I know that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I know that I have made the same 
request to Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To search and he came out again with a 
10 
nod.  But we will do further investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  It is just that if we 
could find those documents it would be great.  But if we do 
not find them then we do not find them.  I just want us to at 
least try. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you know in this commission – the 
commission has been lucky sometimes.  I said to the legal 
20 
team dealing with BOSASA and the investigation team they 
must go to the Victoria Guest House where Mr Agrizzi had 
said Ms Nomvula Mokonyane’s 50 birthday party had been 
held and I said they need to talk to the owners there try 
and find out whether there was such a thing and they went 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 13 of 220 
 
there.  Interestingly although the owner said no he did not 
hold – host the 50 t h birthday party for Ms Mokonyane but 
he said we did host the 40 t h which was eighteen years ago.  
But he was able to get invoices of eighteen years ago.  So 
those were put up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I also said in relation to BOSASA legal 
team and investigation team because there was two 
different versions about whether BOSASA had done some 
work at the Mokonyane home.  They must try and trace the 
10 
people who allegedly – who had allegedly done work there 
and I was told one of them had immigrated to New Zealand 
and I said to them well follow him.  He might just be able 
to confirm or not confirm and they found him and they said 
I have looked and I have actually found invoices of 
2014/2015.  I did work in the house here are the invoices.  
And he did an affidavit and that so I am saying the 
investigators of the commission somehow are able to get 
some very old documents. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the one that Mr Tsotsi is talking 
about are not eighteen years old. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Only five years ago Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So they should try. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Tsotsi would you have 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 14 of 220 
 
received the submission from the Minister of the list by way 
of email as well? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes it came back via email because the 
Minister was – if I recall she was in Mozambique at that 
time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But then you say she called you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka I just want to get 
this out of the way in relation to these documents.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 20.1 of your affidavit you 
10 
say it was in mid-2014 when you met Mr Salim Essa for the 
first time.  But you do not say whether the rest of what you 
discuss under that – these documents whether that was 
mid-2014 or whether it was 2015.  In other words, was it in 
relation to the new board that came in in December or was 
it the old – the first board that you chaired? 
MR TSOTSI:  This was actually in December Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, this was in December. 
MR TSOTSI:   December 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so it was in relation to the new 
20 
board? 
MR TSOTSI:  To the new board yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is quite interesting.  That – that 
may explain certain things.  Ja okay alright.  So this was in 
December? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 15 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes in December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014? 
MR TSOTSI:  2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After the new board had been appointed? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Seleka take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, we have 
seen yesterday that you have also used or have received 
documentation emailed to you from what you said was your 
private email address. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could that not have been used as well 
on this occasion? 
MR TSOTSI:  No,  no. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could you assist us with access to 
that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja I can give you my email address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Email account. 
MR TSOTSI:  But it is not the one I am using now it is a 
different mail.  But the reason for – I am saying it could not 
20 
have been is because I knew that I needed to communicate 
with the Minister and I could not communicate with her on 
a private email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  So it was – it was an Eskom email. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 16 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am talking your email – the email 
you received from Mr Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:  Oh I see.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall what the email address is.  I 
would have a hard time trying to remember what that email 
address was.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka you can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  You see the 
10 
Essa Report Fundudzi Report we have incorporated it into 
your bundle Mr Tsotsi an extract from that report addressed 
to finalise on this aspect.  It is in the smaller bundle which 
is Eskom Bundle 07B on page 1093.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 1093? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1093 that is the beginning of the – the 
extract from the report Chairperson.  I quickly want to draw 
your attention Mr Tsotsi from that extract of the Fundudzi 
Report to page 1099.  It is paragraph 14.8 with the heading 
The Appointment of the Eskom Board.  Just to give you a 
20 
sense of what the Chairperson is talking about I am going 
to read from that report.  It says: 
“During our review of the DPE that is the 
Fundudzi 
emails 
we 
determined 
that 
infoportal1@zoho, - Z-o-h-o.com played a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 17 of 220 
 
role in the composition of various Eskom 
board sub-committees.  We determined that 
on 6 March 2015 infoportal1@zoho.com 
sent an email titled Eskom Committee to 
Davids 
on 
email 
address 
styledanckimwc@gmail.com 
proposing 
various 
Eskom 
sub-committees. 
 
The 
following committees were proposed in the 
said email from inforportal1@zoho.com to 
Davids.” 
 
10 
And then they give you a list. 
“For Audit and Risk number 1 is new lady 
CA Chair.  The next is Verushni Naidoo, 
Nazia Kareem, Romeo Kumalo and Norman 
Baloyi” 
You see that?  The next is the Tender and Procurement.  
The names are as follows: 
“Ben 
Ngubane, 
Zithemba 
Xhosa, 
Nazia 
Kareem and Chwayita Mabude.” 
And it carries on with the IF – what is IFC? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  It is a – I will give it to you now.  Investment 
and Finance Committee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Investment and Finance Committee. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  And you have the names 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 18 of 220 
 
also for IFC for People and Governance, for Social Ethics.  
Let me read People and Governance because that name 
has come up here often.  You have: 
“Chwayita Mabude, Ben Ngubane.” 
They have Chwayita Mabude twice.  First as a chair and 
then as a member.   
“Romeo Kumalo, Venete Klein.” 
You are familiar with these names Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Were these members of the board? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of December 2014? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And these were the according to this 
research report the names that were being proposed by an 
email coming from infoportal for the composition of the 
sub-committees. 
MR TSOTSI:  I see that yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that?  Now if you go back in 
memory can you recall whether you received a list that 
20 
would have compartmentalised those names in the manner 
it is done here in the sense that under this sub-committee 
these are the names?  In this sub-committee these are the 
names.  Is that what the submission would have been to 
you? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 19 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall Chair receiving any of this 
information. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No please you not understanding me 
sorry.  I am saying the email from Mr Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That you say you had received from 
him. 
MR TSOTSI:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or the submission you received from 
him would it have done what is happening here? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is the position I mean you have 
already said that you sent your list to the Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was different from the list that Mr 
Essa had sent to you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Minister ’s response was to send 
you her list that was exactly the same as Mr Essa’s list, is 
that right? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have said that if I – I do not 
know whether you said it or I read it somewhere but 
understand that ultimately the Minister said to you the 
composition of the various committees would be as set out 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 20 of 220 
 
in her list. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is that what happened?  Was her list 
implemented in the composition of the different committee 
or sub-committees of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is exactly how the first composition of 
the board was done yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so which would mean that the 
10 
composition of the various committees of the board for the 
December 2014 board were in accordance with the wishes 
of Mr Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which may have happened to be the 
same as those of the Minister? 
MR TSOTSI:  They were the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Would you be able when you 
look at this composition of these committees – it might be 
difficult.  Would you be able to remember whether this 
20 
composition is in accordance with exactly the various 
committees that were established – oh at least maybe in 
regard to the chairs that might be easier to remember than 
every member.  But if you cannot remember I will 
understand it has been a few years. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 21 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  No I – I am more likely to remember the 
committees that I was involved in.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  I certainly remember that Chwayita Mabude 
was the Chairperson of the People and Governance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Because I remember that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Doctor Ngubane and Tender and 
Procurement, do you remember or not really? 
MR TSOTSI:  I – and I remember that Mark Pamensky was 
10 
a Chairperson of the IFC that I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you remember. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So at least two you can remember.  
Tender and Procurement, you cannot remember whether Dr 
Ngubane was the chairperson. 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not quite remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are not sure about that. 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not remember that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I think it was Venete.  I think... I seem to 
recall Venete was first.  I think she was also... she changed, 
I think, at some point, if I can recall, to go People in 
Governance or one of those but I think, I do recall that she 
was initially the chairperson of the Social and Ethics 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 22 of 220 
 
Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Well... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If it might help you, Mr Tsotsi and 
Chairperson.  If you turn to page 1102, the report actually 
shows you what was proposed in a table format.  What was 
proposed on the left-hand side what the board actually 
approved, on the right-hand side.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you will see Audit and Risk.  What is 
proposed from the email info portal.  You got the names.  
10 
Who is New Lady CA? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, the first table there. 
MR TSOTSI:   New Lady CA?  Oh.  No, I... the only CA that I 
remember was Mr Bob Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not remember any of the ladies being 
CA’s. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay look at the table.  You will see 
essentially all the names that are proposed are the ones 
approved for this Audit and Risk.  So, Viroshini Naidoo.  V 
Naidoo.  I see a Karen, N Karen, on the right.  On the left, 
Romeo Khumalo.  R Khumalo on the left, sorry.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 23 of 220 
 
 
And then on the right it is the same person.  So the only 
difference there seems to be Mr Norman Baloyi.  It was 
proposed that somebody else was appointed, Ms Mabude.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it goes on like that with the other 
sub-committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was... how did you feel about the 
fact 
that 
the 
minister, 
Miss 
Brown, 
insisted 
that 
the 
committees of the board, the Eskom committees of the board 
be composed in the manner indicated in her list which was 
10 
the same as the manner indicated in Mr Salim Essa’s list?   
 
And that your list of how the committee should be – your 
proposal of how the committees should be composed was 
ignored?  How do you feel about that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I was very surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And at that point in time, it was very early in 
the new board’s term.  I mean, it was probably about a week 
and a half or so after the board had been appointed.  And I 
was very infringed by the whole thing and I could not quite 
20 
put my finger on what was going on.   
 
And it was not until I was then called by the minister to 
this meeting where I saw Tony Gupta and Salim Essa.  There 
I said to myself:  Well, clearly the minister is operating under 
the, if you like, the persuasion of these people.  That was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 24 of 220 
 
the view I held.   
 
And the subsequent things that happened, kind of 
confirmed that view for me.  And I guess also, what grow to 
me, because remember, the minister came in 2014 and I 
had... 
 
Before the new board came along, we had something 
like maybe three months or so, I cannot quite remember, 
overlap with the new minister after the departure of Minister 
Gigaba or it could be more than three months.   
 
And you will recall I have been saying that  I was having 
10 
difficulty establishing a working relationship with her.  And 
then I was having these issues with Tony Gupta even before 
the incident we have just discussed earlier on.   
 
And I was then having difficulty with really getting the 
minister to work with me in a way that I would have 
preferred.  And so when I put these things together, I began 
to think to myself:  Is there something that is driving her?   
 
And when I saw this and then to someone, then I said to 
myself I think this is what is driving her.  And this is what is 
determining whether I have a relationship with her or not.  
20 
That is how I rationalised it at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time that Mr Salim Essa sent you 
his list of how the various committees of the board should be 
composed.  Did you understand him to be associated in any 
way with the Guptas or did you not know that at that time? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 25 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Salim Essa – I mean, as I said, I was 
introduced to him by Tony Gupta.  So right from the get-go, I 
mean, I knew ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, in mid-2014? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so when he sent you the list in 
December 2014, you could associate him at least with Tony 
Gupta? 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
you might ask but who is the person communicating from Info 
Portal 1.  Turn to age 1108 in the same report under 
paragraph 14.12.  Are you there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I am going to read to you.  It says: 
“Appointment.  Notices of Board Members at Exco.” 
 
It says: 
“We determined that on 16 July 2015, Davids sent 
20 
an email to Infor Port 1 at zorbo.com from her 
private email address...” 
 
Start and then they give the email address. 
“The title of the email was Trevor CV.”   
 
In the email, David stated the following: 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 26 of 220 
 
“Dear 
Salim, 
herewith 
CV 
for 
Exco 
Board 
as 
discussed.” 
 
And he carried on to say: 
“We noted that Trevor Marais Haasbroek’s CV and a 
motivation 
letter 
purportedly 
been 
prepared 
by 
Trevor and dated 25 July 2015 where attached to 
the said email.   
The email above is an indication that Davids was 
communicating to a certain Salim/Businessman.” 
MR TSOTSI:   I see. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It seems to corroborate your receipt of a 
submission along the same lines from current Mr Salim Essa.   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  That is the end of the 
part from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So it may well be Mr Tsotsi that 
either a substantial number or a substantial percentage of 
the members of your 2015 board had some association or 
20 
some or other association with the Gupta’s? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, there was an expose about Ngubane at 
some point.  I cannot remember exactly when.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   and they had some kind of a diagrammatic 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 27 of 220 
 
representation of the linkages between some of the board 
members, the new board with the associated functionaries of 
the Guptas.  And so, if one is to accept the veracity of that 
work, one has to conclude that that must have been the 
case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   I... at the time I, unfortunately, was more 
focussed... I was more focussed on what was to be done in 
the company at the time.  And so I did not for a minute 
associated the board members in that manner, you know, any 
10 
of them in that manner at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   But I certainly started to understand shortly 
after I left, particularly with what happened with the Tegeta 
incident with the coal mine and what reported to have 
happened and Eskom’s involvement in supposedly funding 
the mine, Tegeta and all the other things that came out of 
that. 
 
So I was rather taken aback by that.  But the one 
overriding thing Chairman which I would not want to leave 
20 
this Commission without mentioning is my view that I held at 
the about the time when I was being pursued by the board 
for the fact that I was not fit to be a director which 
unfortunately we have not had the opportunity to look at here 
but, nonetheless.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 28 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   The impression I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I know we are going back but you can say 
what you want to say. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, maybe to reserve or ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will get there.  But I think, go 
ahead and say what you want to say. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  IN the manner in which things were 
turning out, I had a distinct impression and knowing that the 
Guptas were having some kind of hand in things that are 
10 
going on at Eskom, I had this distinct impression that there 
could be an orchestration of some exercise here to replace 
the top layer of Eskom with other people who associated with 
the Guptas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   And you know, one does not have the concrete 
proof and evidence of these things but one can associated 
events as they occur and be able to, as they say, to connect 
the dots as incidences occur to be able to come to these 
kind of conclusions but that my strongly felt feeling at the 
20 
time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we will get to the points where the 
board tempt on you.  I certainly have the feeling based on 
reading how the events happened the way they did on the – 
starting from the 8t h of March, 9t h and 11t h.  But of course, 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 29 of 220 
 
they need to viewed against your encounter with the minister 
and what Mr Tony Gupta said to you. 
 
But when I see how the board that seemed to be going 
along with you when you came from the Durban meeting and 
you introduced the idea of an inquiry and so on, how they 
seem to later turn against you. 
 
Certainly, in my mind is the question mark as to what 
happened between the time when they seem to be on your 
side when you came to test this idea and at a certain stage, 
they seem to completely turn against you. 
10 
 
It seems unnatural.  It seems – it makes me thing that 
there may have been some discussion outside of the board 
meetings which may have happened which led to the board 
turning against you the way they did. 
 
But one or more members of the board will come here 
and testify and we will hear what they have to say.  I will put 
this to them as well.   
 
You made the point yesterday that after lunch on the 
11t h, you jointed the People and People in Governance 
Committee and found them already discussing names of 
20 
persons who would act in the positions of the executives. 
 
And you said to them:  But I am the only one who knows 
these people.  So here is a new board.  They are discussing 
names but they do not know these people.  So what have 
they done to inform themselves to about these people?   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 30 of 220 
 
 
Are the suspicion that when you came to that meeting 
there were no CV’s of these people? 
MR TSOTSI:   Now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They were not CV’s, they were just 
names? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that all seems very strange.  And then 
of course when you talk about having been given a list by Mr 
Salim 
Essa 
of 
how 
the 
board 
committees 
should 
be 
composed, you wonder how that list of names of people to 
10 
act in those positions where it came from. 
 
You wonder where it came from and why the board or 
committee members might not have thought it necessary to 
get more information about these people 
 
And one would have thought that your presence as a 
board member who had been on the previous board and 
therefore knew the people around much better, why they 
would not wait for you and hear what you had to say. 
 
So it raises various questions that need to be asked and 
one needs to see what answers one gets.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, let 
us go into this because it is – it may be significant.  When 
you go back to page – or if you could please go back to page 
21 of your affidavit.  In paragraph... I will give you a 
moment, sorry.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 31 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To page 21, paragraph 17.  And we will 
come back to the disciplinary, purported disciplinary action 
the board then took against you.  Paragraph 17 says: 
“I had already left Eskom at the time the decision to 
appoint Dentons was under discussion.” 
 
They are referring to Dentons investigation.  Now we 
know from Mr Matona and from your testimony yesterday that 
the executives were being suspended on the ground that the 
inquiry was to initiated should be an impeded investigation.   
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You recall that.  Before you were – 
before you resigned, let me use that word, who was the 
service provider appointed to conduct that inquiry? 
MR TSOTSI:   The way things were at that point Chair before 
I left.  The board had made the decision on the 11t h that it 
would like Nick Linnell to assist it in coordinating the work 
that needed to be done before the service provider comes 
onboard, namely, that he would deal with the matter of the 
suspensions and also assist the Audit and Risk Committee to 
20 
formulate the terms of reference for the inquiry.   
 
So there was preliminary work that needed to be done, 
obviously, before you could have a service provider in place 
and that is the assignment that the board asked Nick Linnell 
to undertake.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 32 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you are saying mister – you are 
saying to the Chairpersons, the board had to resolve to 
appointed Mr Nick Linnell? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That resolution, was it on the 9t h, at the 
meeting of the 9t h or at the meeting of the 11 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was on the 11t h, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you – the circumstances under 
10 
which you introduced Mr Linnell to the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how you got to have – how he got to 
be at the meeting or how you brought – where you got him 
from? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair.  Because Linnell was introduced to 
the board.  On that same day... and this is probably 
something you may come to that, but I just thought it is 
worthwhile mentioning that.   
 
Not only was it Nick Linnell who was asked to assist the 
20 
board.  One of the board members suggested that there is a 
gentleman who has expertise in communication and we 
needed to put and communicate to the public about what was 
– about the undertaking, namely the inquiry.   
 
And the name of a particular individual was proposed 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 33 of 220 
 
and this sub-committee who responsible at the time, which 
was People in Governance, then acceded to the fact that let 
us have this individual also support.  And he did do the work.  
It was a man called Happy Ntshinga.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   So the experience of... yes, I want to use the 
word engaging, these individuals was clearly demonstrated 
in the actions of the board.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  And let us quickly 
see what Mr Nick Linnell says before we turn to the board – 
10 
come back to the board itself.  Now he has ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I have just remembered.  If 
you can, we ought to look at what Miss Lynne Brown has to 
say about Mr Tsotsi’s evidence about the list.  We need to 
cover that if we have not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say, does she deny that the list that 
she gave to Mr Tsotsi was the same as the list that Mr Tsotsi 
had got from Mr Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, can we put that version to Mr 
Tsotsi right away? 
CHAIRPERSON:   At whichever you prefer.  I am happy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Let us get it off the way. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 34 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That... Mr Tsotsi, that is... the former 
minister’s affidavit is on page 334.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not want to forget this question, Mr 
Tsotsi.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After you have done with that question, I 
would like you to address the question of why the minister 
was getting involved in how committees of the board were 
proposed.  I just do not want to you... Let us deal with this 
10 
and then after that you address that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What page did you say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the minister, the former 
minister’s affidavit.  It is on page 434. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   434? 
CHAIRPERSON:   434. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 434. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You should then find the passage where 
she specifically deals with the encounter you say you had 
with her.  I believe it is on page 440, paragraph 56 under the 
heading General.  Are you there, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I am.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 35 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads: 
“I cannot comment on a list that allegedly was sent 
by Mr Essa to Mr Tsotsi as I have never seen it. 
Mr Tsotsi never specified it at any stage, the 
composition of list, nor did he ever indicate what his 
own drawn up list look like.  
It is inexplicable to me that in the execution of the 
board’s 
task 
of 
appointing 
members 
of 
board 
committees, Mr Tsotsi would not generate his own 
list but would rather work from a list allegedly 
10 
compiled by a strange to Eskom.” 
 
Then there is... ja, it carries on.  Paragraph 58: 
“I persist in denying that a Mr Tony Gupta and a Mr 
Salim Essa were not together or individually visited 
my official residence in Pretoria. 
I have explained the process that guided me in the 
appointment of members of the Risk and Audit 
Committee and Social Ethics Committee. 
I have also explained how I communicated my 
decision to the Eskom Chairperson. 
20 
When 
there 
is 
an 
unexplained 
delay 
in 
the 
implementation with my decision, there is nothing 
remiss in assisting that the Eskom Chairperson must 
implement my decision.” 
 
The next page: 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 36 of 220 
 
“There are a few things that are strange to me on 
this issue.  It is for me curious that Mr Tsotsi upon 
his alleged receipt of the list from Mr Essa, never on 
its own as a conscientious chairperson reported his 
alleged surprise to anyone. 
He never protested it to me.  He never raised his 
concerns with the Eskom Board as one would except 
a conscientious chairperson to do. 
That he never volunteered this allegedly important 
information to the former Public Protector when she 
10 
was 
conducting 
her 
investigations 
into 
Eskom, 
having been appointed in December 2014, new 
directors had to be inducted.  To Eskom, this is an 
intensive programme in which I play a limited role.” 
 
We should go back to paragraph 57, Mr Tsotsi.  The 
suggestion that seems to be made there that, not only did 
you show the minister the list given to you by Mr Salim Essa 
but that even your own list does not seem to have been 
given to the minister.  That not only did you show the 
Minister, the list given to you by Mr Salim Essa but that 
20 
even your own list has not seemed to have been given to 
the Minister.  It is inexplicable to me that in the execution 
of the board’s task of appointing members of the board 
committees, Mr Tsotsi would not generate his own list but 
would rather work from the list allegedly compiled by a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 37 of 220 
 
stranger to Eskom.   
Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I see that, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Any comment? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, I cannot really say much, Chair, except 
to say I think one day the truth will come out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that?  I did not 
hear. 
MR TSOTSI:   I am saying, Chair, I cannot really comment 
much but I think and hope that one day the truth will come 
10 
out as to what actually happened but clearly, she is 
denying that she ever communicated with me about this list 
whereas I got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, the way to deal with what she 
says, her version, when the evidence leader gives you this 
opportunity, is that if you are sure that you did send him 
your list and if you are sure that she sent you a list that is 
– was the same as the list you got from Mr Essa and that 
actually you did have a discussion with her about your list 
and her list, the way to respond is to say what you said 
20 
happened happened, you did speak about it and if she says 
that did not happen, that what she is saying is not true.  If 
you are not sure, you indicate that you think there was a 
discussion, but you are not sure.   
So, in other words, you need to be clear.  If you are 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 38 of 220 
 
quite clear in your own mind, that is what must come out 
but if you are not clear about it, you think maybe we did 
talk, maybe I am mistaken, we did not talk, then you reflect 
it as that.  So what is the position? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I am perfectly clear that I did 
communicate with the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
The 
Minister 
was 
on 
vacation 
in 
Mozambique. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   It was mid-December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And how I got to learn she was on a vacation 
in Mozambique is because Salim Essa told me that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I am very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That I did communicate with her, there is no 
doubt in my mind whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is no doubt, she received – she 
20 
was aware of your list. 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she sent you a different list. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that list she sent you was the same 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 39 of 220 
 
as the list you got from Mr Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she had occasion to speak to you 
and say you must implement her list. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not yours. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So about that you are quite clear? 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What will need to be done, Mr 
10 
Seleka, if it has not been done is to check whether she 
was 
not 
in 
Mozambique 
around 
mid-December, 
the 
Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Because 
Mr 
Tsotsi 
says 
he 
can 
remember quite well that they had that discussion and that 
she was in Mozambique.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Will certainly do that, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then, Mr Tsotsi, the Chairperson’s 
question was why – or I will paraphrase. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Why Minister Lynne Brown was getting 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 40 of 220 
 
involved in the appointments for the subcommittees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I would have thought that what 
committees – or who says in what committee should be a 
matter for the board.  Am I mistaken in that regard? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, it is a matter for the board, it has 
always been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The only committee that the Minister has a 
responsibility for putting together is a statutory committee 
which is the audit and risk committee. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Audit and risk committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  Then she has a responsibility of 
the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On that one she has a role to play. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is her role – does her role include 
indicating who should serve on the committee or is her role 
to make sure that there is a risk and audit committee, how 
it is composed should be left to the board.  
MR TSOTSI:   My recollection, Chair, I may be wrong here, 
20 
but my recollection is that she has prerogative to appoint 
the Chairperson of that committee.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay, 
okay. 
 
That 
is 
your 
recollection. 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes.    
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 41 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    But your – that is the only committee 
where to your knowledge the Minister has some role to 
play. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So why was she then getting 
involved in how various other committees were composed 
and why were you allowing her to be involved in that to the 
extent that she was – that you were going to implement her 
list when you had your own list that you believed was the 
right list? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, the list, ordinarily the board extends a 
courtesy to the Minister to say Minister, this is the 
selection of and the board subcommittees just so she is 
aware of who was in which committee.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And in this instance that was the intention 
and hence when I changed the list and sent it to her it was 
precisely for that reason. 
MR TSOTSI:   Now it again occurred to me that she 
seemed to be fulfilling other interests and so I took it that 
20 
she was acting at the behest of someone else and I 
certainly took it that at the end of the day she is imposing 
this list on the board and I did not want to resist that at the 
time because I just felt that perhaps this is not going to be 
a good thing to do because it is important to keep relations 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 42 of 220 
 
with the shareholder for the smooth running of the 
business.  So at that point in time because I really felt had 
to renew in terms of the board, I knew they were struggling 
with creating a relationship with her so I had made up my 
mind that maybe if I let this go it would be a way to try and 
do some kind of level of – or improve the level of 
relationship between myself and her.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Did the board ever see your list 
that you had proposed or either before you sent it to the 
Minister or after? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   I doubt it, Chairman, I do not think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, hang on, I might be wrong here.  When 
we know what to do when we make these suggestions 
about who to act were based, by the way, on the CVs of the 
individuals.  We know when you communicate especially 
the people who would like to Chair the committees, we 
normally communicate with them to say look, I have a 
suggestion, I think this is the committee that you should 
Chair, etcetera, and then, you know, try to fill in and then 
20 
you try to rationalise why you have put different people in 
the different committee. 
 
Now I really do not recall whether that exercise 
there was time for me to clean all of this back and forth.  
Whether in fact that actually happened, I really do not 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 43 of 220 
 
remember.  Maybe some of the board members may be 
able to attest to that.  But I do not remember myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it that ultimately or at some stage 
you circulated the Minister ’s list of how the various 
committees should be composed and circulated back to all 
the board members.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you remember when it was that you 
did that?  Would it have been prior to the meeting of the 9 t h 
and 11 t h or did it happen either on the 9 t h or the 11 March? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it would have happened long before 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Long before that, ja.  When you 
circulated that list do you remember whether you circulated 
– whether you disclosed to the members that it was the 
Minister ’s list of how the committees should be composed 
or whether you did not disclose that, you just said here is a 
proposal of how various committees of the board should be 
composed, let me have your views of something like that?  
MR TSOTSI:   No, I did not disclose that this is the list that 
20 
the Minister has imposed on us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I just simply informed the board members of, 
you know, of the listing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you just inform them on the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 44 of 220 
 
basis that that was the list, that is how the committees 
would be composed or did you circulate to them on the 
basis that there should be a discussion to see whether this 
list of how various committees should be composed was 
acceptable? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, I actually, you know, should not use 
the word informed in the sense that I gave the board 
members copies of the list with the intention of them 
assessing for themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   You know, the suitability of themselves in 
those particular committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so any member could say, no, I do 
not think I fit into this committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would prefer to be in another 
committee and so on. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They could say that. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the idea that they would say that 
ahead of the first meeting or was it something that would 
be finalised at the first meeting of the board, the question 
of the committees.  In other words, was the idea that the 
issue of the composition of the various committees should 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 45 of 220 
 
be finalised ahead of the first meeting or was the idea that 
they could give their views but ultimately the final decision 
as to how the committees of the board were to be 
composed would be made at the first meeting of the board?  
MR TSOTSI:   Well, the way it works, Chair, because of the 
fact that the board meeting was a bit distant, like – and 
there was work to be done, the committees began working 
immediately once they settled into the compositions that 
they were in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   And if there was any feeling of an individual 
that they would rather be in another committee then that 
would have come up in the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been sorted out ahead 
of the first meeting [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, ahead of the first meeting, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not wait for the first meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would it be fair to say that the 
members 
of 
the 
committee 
unless 
they 
had 
other 
20 
information from somebody else, would have thought that 
this list represented your proposal, your idea of how the 
committees of the board should be composed.  
MR TSOTSI:   That would be the case, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be fair to say that. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 46 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if they had information from 
somewhere else, they might know that – where the list 
came from. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you would not know.  Ja, okay.  Mr 
Seleka? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think in hindsight, I think that is the case, 
but I cannot vouch for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Tsotsi earlier 
you were articulating the view to the Chairperson that 
actually coming to think about it, you think the executives 
were being removed to make way for other people.  
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now given what has been said was the 
reason for step aside or suspension of the executives not 
influence the inquiry, did the board have any evidence or 
previous 
interference 
by 
these 
executives 
in 
any 
investigation within Eskom? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No, the board did not have any formal 
information  that was presented to it about any of that.  
However, it seems during the processes that we were 
undertaking that specific board members had specific 
information 
about 
specific 
board 
members 
or 
rather, 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 47 of 220 
 
executives and I think the reason why that attitude did not 
prevail, did not get any currency in the discussions was 
because the whole purpose was that the executives had 
done nothing wrong and that there is no intention of 
accusing them of anything wrong and hence subjecting 
them to suspension on that basis.   
So whatever was mentioned in regard to specific 
executives in any of their discussions did not really get any 
currency for that reason but the board per se did not 
express itself on that, it did not take that position. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is just strange how a new board 
that has hardly done any work in an entity in its first 
meeting, that is, an idea that definitely came from outside 
of the entity and they just run with it the way this board 
seems to have done so, you remove so many executives 
who I think are critical to the entity just like that and then, 
of course, you remove the Chairperson of the board who 
has been around for quite some time all within two, three 
days it is all done.  It is just very strange to me.  I would 
have thought that for something like this a board would 
20 
really need to reflect, need some time, they are new in the 
entity but it seems they just ran with this idea that came 
from outside.  Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  And so, Mr 
Tsotsi, that is, you say, the board does not make any 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 48 of 220 
 
allegation of wrongdoing against them and that is not the 
basis why they were suspended, is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, that is correct [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is not the basis on which they 
were – and I can see from your affidavit you ultimately 
separate or resign from Eskom on 30 March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say by the time Dentons was 
appointed – or, in fact you say: 
10 
“I had already left Eskom at the time the decision to 
appoint Dentons was under discussion.” 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Dentons would have been 
appointed after you had left Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dentons was not appointed in the 
meeting of the 11 March 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now let us see, we have the report of 
20 
Dentons and I want  us to look at what was the mandate to 
Dentons when it ultimately gets appointed and that report 
is contained on page 918 to 994, it is an extract of the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 49 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 918, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in the smaller…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the bigger. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the bigger one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the bigger. 
CHAIRPERSON:   918? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  118 will be the cover page, see 
the report followed by the Table of Contents and the 
introduction starts on page 922.  I will read only certain 
paragraphs of the report.  1.1 – are you there, Mr Tsotsi?,   
10 
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Under Background it says: 
“This document constitutes the report of Dentons 
South 
Africa 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
investigation 
commissioned by Eskom.  Pursuant to a request for 
proposals issued on 8 April 2015 under…” 
A number they refer to there. 
“…in terms of a resolution adopted by the board of 
directors of Eskom on 11 March 2015.” 
Now I do not know which resolution they are referring to 
20 
there but they say in 1.2 that: 
“The investigation commenced on 20 April 2015.” 
Then we turn the page, Mr Tsotsi, of significance to what I 
wish to refer you to, paragraph 4, page 924.  Paragraph 4: 
“Purpose of the investigation.” 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 50 of 220 
 
Can you see that?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   4.1 says: 
“The institution of the investigation took place 
shortly after the highly publicised suspension of 
four of Eskom’s executives. (Suspended executives) 
4.2: 
“The TOR…” 
Which is terms of reference. 
“…refers to the abovementioned suspensions only 
obliquely stating in respect of the investigation that 
10 
it is important for the information to be tested by an 
independent 
party 
without 
Exco’s 
involvement, 
(particularly those members of Exco whose areas 
would be directly impacted by the inquiry) to as to 
lend credence to the reports that the independent  
party will produce.” 
4.3 
The written material setting out scope of the 
investigation never contemplated investigation as 
being: 
(i) 
 That 
was 
directed 
specifically 
at 
the 
20 
conduct of the suspended executives.  The 
timing of the investigation led to speculation 
in certain circles that it was the conduct of 
the suspended executives that was being 
investigated.  On the meetings with the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 51 of 220 
 
board an audit and risk committee of the 
board, 
it 
was 
confirmed 
that 
the 
investigation 
was 
not 
directed 
in 
the 
suspended executives and that the board 
was dealing with the suspended executives 
in accordance with a separate methodology. 
4.9 
So, as the TOR, the terms of reference, do not 
require investigation of misconduct of any specific 
individuals.  Accordingly, no recommendations are 
made in respect of action to be taken to deal with 
10 
misconduct by any specific individuals.” 
Do you see all that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it appears clearly from this report 
and it is also be consistent with the board’s position that 
we are not suspending them for misconduct, that even 
misconduct or wrongdoing was not within the scope of 
Dentons’ investigation. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now the question is – and maybe it 
touches on the view you expressed to the Chairperson – 
there 
is 
no 
allegation 
of 
wrongdoing 
against 
the 
executives.  As you testified, Mr Matona said no concerns 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 52 of 220 
 
about the war room were raised with him.  You told the 
Chairperson you cannot recall raising concerns directly 
with him.  Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You told the Chairperson that the 
Deputy President, who was heading the war room, did not 
raise concerns with you about information the war room 
was receiving from the executives, is that correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just articulate your response? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dentons’ scope of investigation does 
not include investigating wrong doing on the part of the 
executives or any individual there, sir. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is – and I am talking about 
interference - there is no evidence you say the board had 
about previous interference in an inquiry about these 
things, evidence. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the question remains – and that 
is exactly what the Commission is trying to determine, what 
then were the real reasons for the suspensions of these 
executives?  And we know from Mr Matona, they never 
came back, there were separation agreements in the end.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 53 of 220 
 
And, as you say, it was moving people out of the way to 
make way for others. 
 
Let me then – what would you say then were the 
real reasons? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, as I think more about this issue 
and as I also reflect seriously on a number of things that 
have been happening, not just at Eskom, and knowing the 
appetite of the Guptas for acquisition of whatever assets 
they can lay their hands on.   
And, you know, having seen that also at Eskom 
10 
itself, I came to the conclusion that they wanted to have 
people in the organisation who would serve their direct 
interest and that it would be easier for them to basically 
capture Eskom.  That was – and it still is – the analysis 
that I ended up with on looking at what is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course about a month after the 
executives had been suspended, Minister Lynne Brown 
announced the secondment of Mr Brian Molefe to Eskom as 
Group CEO or Acting Group CEO and I think not long after 
that, if I am not mistaken, I do not know how many months, 
20 
Mr Anoj Singh – I do not know whether he – I do not 
remember whether he was also initially seconded, I think 
he was seconded but ultimately both of those two men 
were two key positions at Eskom.  Now there are all kinds 
of allegations and there is evidence that has been led in 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 54 of 220 
 
this Commission as to certain roles that they – that it is 
said 
they 
played 
at 
Transnet 
relating 
to 
various 
transactions and if I find in the end that they were – they 
cooperated with the Gupta’s or the associates of the 
Gupta’s at Transnet then there may well be a possibility 
that 
the 
Gupta’s 
had 
dealt 
with 
Transnet 
to 
their 
satisfaction.   
          And now wanted to move onto Eskom that wanted 
people that they could trust, who would work with them and 
did not wanted people that they did not know whether they 
10 
would go along or not, there is that possibility.  And when 
all evidence is in it is one of the things that I must look at 
and see whether there is proper evidence to make a 
finding.  So that it is a possibility and it may well be that 
it’s the Gupta’s and their associates who were responsible 
for this whole idea of an enquiry that Ms Myeni mentioned 
at the Durban meeting that you took to the board.   
          You did say that independently of Ms Myeni, you 
had a view about the need for an enquiry for yourself and 
that the suspension of the executives may have been part 
20 
of that plan.  Remove them so that you can then bring in 
people that the Gupta’s or their associates trusted would 
cooperate in whatever they wanted to do at Eskom.  And it 
may be that they had worked there plan well that in order 
to achieve that you need to first capture the board or 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 55 of 220 
 
capture the majority of the board so that when decisions 
have to be made by the board they would know that the 
majority in the board would be people who would cooperate 
with them.         
MR TSOTSI:   That is the first summary Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Seleka well I want to raise on the 
same page that Mr Seleka was asking you on namely 925 
this entrance report at paragraph 4.6.  It says ATOR that is 
terms of reference and pass order 1.  State expressly that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
investigation 
was 
to 
obtain 
an 
10 
independent view on the credibility and correctness of the 
reports of Eskom’s executive committee as to the board.   
          Now that sounds strange to me because it suggests 
that the entire purpose of this enquiry that was being 
talked about on the 11 t h as it turned out later was to obtain 
an independent view or was about the credibility or 
correctness of the reports that the executives were giving 
to the board.  Is that how you understand that part as well 
about what you might have thought at that time but if you 
read this sentence is that what you understand as well?    
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is my understanding Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now if that is correct then the 
question is what information had the executives really sent 
to the board before the 11 t h  when the board had hardly had 
meetings?   Now of course there may be – I mean the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 56 of 220 
 
committees 
had 
been 
established 
and 
may 
be 
the 
committees had started working, I do not know before the 
first meeting.  But it is strange that the board had not had 
any 
meetings. 
 
So 
when 
had 
the 
executives 
given 
information to the board whose credibility was being put in 
question?     
MR TSOTSI:   It is exactly correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you understand what I mean? 
MR TSOTSI:   I understand exactly Chair because the 
board would not have known before information between 
10 
the old board and the executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   So that is not reference quite right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   The board can only make judgments about 
information that it receives from the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   So what exactly did the board receive from 
the executives.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And in so far as they may be talk about 
20 
information given to the previous board one would think 
that it would reflect that they are talking about the previous 
board.   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   This does not say that.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 57 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And obviously you are able to confirm 
because you were the Chairperson of this board until the 
13 t h of March.  You are able to confirm whether or not the 
executives had by the 9 t h of March or the 11 t h of March 
supplied this new board with any information whose 
credibility was in question.    
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I would Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and was there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Especially because Chair prior to board 
10 
meetings the chief executive and I sat down and look at 
the agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   And we actually discuss those points from 
my perspective obviously because I am aware of Eskom’s 
business and the extend that I can perhaps look at the 
technicalities.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:   So we discuss in detail precisely what is 
being given, information that has been given to the board.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   So I pretty much know ahead of the board 
meeting what the board is going to discuss and the 
credibility of that information.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So as you sit there what is your reaction 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 58 of 220 
 
to this when you here that according to 4.6 the sentence 
says 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
and 
pass 
order 
stated 
expressly that the purpose of the investigation was to 
obtain 
an 
independent 
view 
on 
the 
credibility 
and 
correctness of the reports of Eskom’s executive committee 
to the board.    
MR TSOTSI:   What it says to me Chair is that if they come 
up with a position which says the executives have not been 
providing the board with information that is credible and 
correct then the board is in a position to attribute that to 
10 
these executives that they have been suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.     
MR TSOTSI:   So they are then able to point a finger and 
say you people are guilty of misinforming the board to that 
effect.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are able to say from 
December when this new board was appointed on the 11 t h 
of March there were no reports of any significance that the 
executives have given to this new board whose credibility 
was in question.  Are you able to say that?  
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I am able to say that Chairman and I am 
also able to say that it would have been unlikely that the 
executives would have been able to assess the information 
in any case.  I mean the board members because they 
knew it would have taken them a long time to really 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 59 of 220 
 
understand Eskom’s business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:   To the extent that there is accountable 
information that is not credible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, if the executives had 
given this new board before the 9 t h of March or before the 
11 t h of March the reports that were questionable, I would 
imagine that the new board would have sort to first meet 
and say what does everybody think about this reports.  
There would be a discussion of these reports to see 
10 
whether 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
reports 
that 
they 
were 
questionable thought that they had no credibility and then 
they would then take a view as to what they should do 
about that.  Is it not?    
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that happen? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it did not happen Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not happen? 
MR TSOTSI:   No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka, I think we should take 
20 
the tea adjournment unless you want to follow up with 
some of the questions.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It can wait I thought that when we 
adjourn, I would have finished with Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 60 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I also appreciate that the 
Chairperson 
might 
have 
questions 
arising 
from 
my 
questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So maybe then we could take the tea 
adjournment I would agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   On my return the Chairperson can 
then…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine as long as from your 
10 
side to when you stopped you are satisfied that you have 
covered all these questions.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we take the tea adjournment it is 
about twenty-nine minutes to twelve we will resume at 
quarter to twelve.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  May I proceed Chairperson or you 
are still… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 61 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Mr Tsotsi as I indicated we would 
before 
the 
adjournment 
that 
we 
would 
come 
to 
the 
disciplinary action the board then sought to take against you. 
And you deal with that on page 21 – from page 21 of your 
affidavit.  And I want us to consider that – sorry I will give 
you a moment to get there.   
MR TSOTSI:  Okay I am there Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I want us to consider this together 
with the minutes of the meeting at which the board made this 
10 
resolution to institute charges against you.  That minute it is 
on page 679.  It is a minute and you will get to it of the 
meeting of 19 March 2015.  Page 679.   
MR TSOTSI:  Sorry Chair should I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am contemplating whether to wait with 
this question until you are done with your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair the floor is yours.  I will not forget 
my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well looking at that page that we are 
looking at before the tea break of the [00:02:45] Report and 
20 
in particular I think paragraph 4.9 that Mr Seleka referred 
you to where they said that the Terms of Reference made it 
clear 
that 
the 
investigation 
was 
– 
did 
not 
include 
investigating any misconduct or allegations of misconduct on 
the part of the executives.  My mind goes back to the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 62 of 220 
 
question.  Remember you said yesterday the motivation as to 
why 
the 
executives 
should 
not 
be 
there 
while 
the 
investigation was going on whether you call it suspension or 
special leave or whatever or recusal was that employees 
might fear giving certain information to the investigators.  Is 
that right?  You remember that? 
MR TSOTSI:  I remember Chair correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if the position is that whatever the 
investigation 
was 
doing 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
any 
allegations of misconduct on the part of executives.  Why 
10 
would – why would it be thought that employees might not 
want to say – give certain information to the investigators 
when whatever information they may be asked about would 
not reflect on any allegations of misconduct on the part of 
the executives. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is a good question Chair.  I cannot 
specifically say why.  One would just have to try to put 
oneself in the mind of the employees themselves and I 
suppose the reactive instinct of an employee will be to 
safeguard their own position, make sure that they are not 
20 
prejudiced by any [00:05:13] inquiry that is taking place and 
that if they have knowledge of anything they might feel that 
there is an opportunity for them to express whatever 
knowledge they have concerning the business.  Now whether 
the knowledge itself ends up being the information rather 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 63 of 220 
 
that they give out ends up being prejudicial to the person 
who is suspended one would not say.  I do not know whether 
from ultimately out of the Benton’s Report there was such a 
thing that in fact employees expressed reservations or in 
fact 
direct 
accusations 
of 
inappropriateness 
by 
the 
individuals who were under suspension I do not know 
whether that happened or not but I thought maybe there 
could be a potential for that sort of thing to happen.  But like 
you are saying there the intention was not to find fault with 
them in terms of the Terms of Reference in which case if the 
10 
contractor really understood their responsibility then they 
would not be dealing with that kind of information.  That 
would be irrelevant in their Terms of Reference.  And so this 
should not and would not have come up and if it did come up 
I would be surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because one can understand a situation 
where it might be thought since the investigations in a 
particular case if the investigation – if an investigation in a 
particular case relates to allegations of misconduct on the 
part of the executives one might understand the – the fear 
20 
that employees might not feel free to talk to the investigators 
about the allegations of misconduct on the part of the 
executives, their bosses.  But once you take misconduct out 
of the equation it just seems to me that there might be very 
little to support the fear that employees might not be able to 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 64 of 220 
 
give information to the investigators that they may be asked 
to give which has got nothing to do with allegations of 
misconduct.   
MR TSOTSI:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  So Mr Tsotsi I 
was referring you to the minutes of the meeting of the 19 
March 2015.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I have them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said we must go to what page? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To page 680. 
CHAIRPERSON:  680? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct Chair.  The minutes start on page 
679. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 680 are you there Mr Tsotsi?  
Relevant 
to 
my 
point 
is 
paragraph 
8.3. 
 
Suspended 
Executives.  You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well let us see who was present in this 
20 
meeting.  I see the members on page 679.  You are also 
there as the Chairperson. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you were in attendance of this 
meeting? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 65 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Doctor Ngubane is there.  Ms Mabude, 
Ms Klein, Ms Naidoo, Ms Karrim, Mr Kumalo and Mr Baloyi.  
Paragraph 8.3 reads: 
“Suspended Executives.  With regard to the letters from 
suspended executives including the CE it was agreed that 
the position was clear that no charges would be preferred 
against the suspended executives at this stage.” 
So that was still reiterated. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No charges against the executives.  Well 
they say at this stage but we know that ultimately no charges 
were brought against them. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“The legal department was authorised to send the letter that 
had been prepared in this regard.   The Chairman explained 
the background as to which Nick Linnell was and that he the 
Chairman had been introduced to him in a meeting with 
President.  Mr Linnell had offered to coordinate the work that 
20 
was supposed to be done.  The Chairman stated that he did 
not offer the board an opportunity to agree to appoint Mr 
Linnell and that this had been mistake on his part and Mr 
Linnell had probably believed that the proper processes had 
been complied with and he then proceeded to undertake the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 66 of 220 
 
work.” 
Now Mr Tsotsi let me draw this to your attention.  These 
minutes of the meeting of 19 March 2015 the minutes are 
signed if you go to page 682 – page 682 are you there? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you see the date on which the 
minutes were signed? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you tell the Chairperson? 
MR TSOTSI:  They are signed on the 18 November 2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  19 March must be a mistake.  It should be 
9 March or not? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you see at the – on 679 it says it is the 
minutes of a meeting held on 19 March 2015.  You had 
resigned with effect from the 13 March is it not? 
MR TSOTSI:  13 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  13 March or 30? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought it was 13? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  No 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Oh okay no, no then I am terribly 
sorry.  I thought it was 13. Okay.  Okay no then there must 
nothing wrong with that date ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 67 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes continue.  I think you have put 
a question.  Yes you can – may continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes it is [00:12:25]  Mr Tsotsi you say the 
date of the minutes… 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair the date on these minutes of the 19 
March 2015 they were signed on the 18 November 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is – that is a long time ago. 
MR TSOTSI:  More than a year – more than a year later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About a year and a half. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  In fact a year and a half. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well it is nearly two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nearly two years. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And who signed the minutes? 
MR TSOTSI:  It looks like Doctor Ngubane’s signature. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well there is an inscription there.  Signed 
by Doctor Ngubane. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  It is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For the purposes of the record.  You see 
that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it says Chairperson. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 68 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  It says Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the Chairperson – he was your 
successor as Chairperson of the board. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And now let us go back.  So by the time 
these minutes were signed most probably signifying the 
approval of the minutes you had long left the employment of 
Eskom. – I mean not – [00:13:42] to your position is he 
chairman of the board. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you have the opportunity to look at 
these minutes before your resignation on 30 March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  Not at all Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was a draft of this minutes presented to 
you for consideration? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now I have read that – if you go back to 
page 680 I have read the paragraph which says that:  The 
Chairman explained and I suppose they are referring to  
20 
yourself at the time as the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And explaining the background the 
meeting with the President and that you did not give the 
board the opportunity to agree to appoint Mr Linnell. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 69 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well they are writing about you, is that a 
correct recordal of what transpired in that meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  The aspect which says the quote the Chairman 
stated that he did not offer the board an opportunity to agree 
to appoint Mr Linnell and that is simply a mistake on his part.  
I do not believe this.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That did not happen? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair it could not have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you could not have said that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  No  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or could you have said that? 
MR TSOTSI:  No I could not have said that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Because the minutes of the either the I think it 
is the end committee meeting of the board clearly state that 
Mr Linnell was requested by the board to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Both these committees that were working on 
this project. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  And it was not with purpose and the brief of 
the Chairman to appoint any individual.  And it is that of the 
committee the People and Governance Committee.  So there 
was no question of my affording or otherwise the board the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 70 of 220 
 
opportunity to appoint Nick.  It was for the board or sub-
committee of the board to do the appointment.  So I think 
this minute is clearly not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not subscribe to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you think it factually not true? 
MR TSOTSI:  I believe it is factually it is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do not know whether Mr Seleka you 
10 
want to contrast that with the minutes of the board that Mr 
Tsotsi talked about before you exhaust other aspects that he 
might say are not true or whether you want to first exhaust 
that and then compare.  But I leave it to you whichever is 
convenient. 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair that is correct because there is a 
problem there as well so I want to take him back there 
before I go to that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this Mr Tsotsi relates to the audio 
20 
recordings that you have had the opportunity to look at 
overnight – apology for that and the clip I would like to play 
to you is found on – the transcript on page 692 of the 
transcript Chairperson.  The corresponding audio will be 
played once you are on that page.  692.  Now this as an 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 71 of 220 
 
introduction will be a meeting be back on the 11 March 2015.  
And it is a meeting in which you introduce Mr Linnell. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you are ready Chair we …  
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
Chairperson for your purposes if the Chair does not hear I 
think we can stop and Mr Tsotsi can relate what he is saying.  
Mr Tsotsi you – you use the name Nick. Maybe you could tell 
the Chairperson who you are referring to there or talking  
MR TSOTSI:  It is Nick Linnell. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well maybe the first thing is just for 
him to confirm that the voice we have heard is his voice. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is my voice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is your voice. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then the – answer the question that 
Mr Seleka has put to you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do confirm that Nick refers to Nick 
Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So at this – at this stage in the meeting 
you are addressing Mr Linnell? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 72 of 220 
 
 ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi you say to him that you have 
explained to the board although he has already explained to 
the board. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So by that time the board knew. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About what the purpose of Mr Linnell was 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are speaking to Mr Linnell inside 
the meeting of the board.  The other members of the board 
10 
are listening they can hear you, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you say I have already explained to 
the board if they think that is not true, they have the chance 
to say no, no, what are you talking about? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not speaking to Mr Linnell in some 
other room just the two of you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes, no I was speaking to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Because what happened is this that this 
meeting takes place immediately after the meeting with 
Minister Brown. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  The board sits and deliberates on what the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 73 of 220 
 
Minister’s input was and in the course of that deliberation 
the board is informed of the availability of Nick Linnell to 
support and assist the board.  And the board makes a 
conscious decision that it would be interested in Nick Linnell 
assisting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  In this aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is at that point when then I decided then well 
or the board was agreeable to them saying, let us then invite 
10 
Nick into the meeting so that he can tell us who he is and 
what he does and what he is proposing etcetera.  Which is 
basically the substance of this entire recording on this 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  It is about him and what he is able to offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:  So this is the beginning part where I now 
introduce Nick. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Into the board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 74 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi is that – was it – does it 
correspond with the transcript? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes it does. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who is – what is the question being 
asked? 
MR TSOTSI:  The question is, so Chair is it Executive of 
Finance included as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And who is asking that question? 
MR TSOTSI:  I actually could not identify that particular 
voice.  I am not sure whether it was Vinete Klein or it was … 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a male voice. 
MR TSOTSI:  If it is Naidoo.  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the voice that was doing most of the 
talking in what we have just listened to now is still your 
voice? 
MR TSOTSI:  It is still me yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think each time we have listened you 
must just say that is still my voice so that whoever reads the 
20 
transcript can know ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
MR TSOTSI:  That is now Nick Linnell coming in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is who coming in now?

MR TSOTSI:  That was still Mr Linnell – Nick Linnell. 
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now who is that? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is Doctor Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
MR TSOTSI:  And then he goes on to introduce himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Tsotsi.  Then I want to skip 
that part and please go to time stamp 23.  That is on page 
20 
707 of the transcript Mr Tsotsi.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am sorry who is speaking? 
MR TSOTSI:  That was Nick Linnell speaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is still Mr Linnell speaking? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay can you just go back to where he 
starts just where he started just now.  Not right at the back. 
[AUDIO PLAYING][INAUDIBLE] 
MR TSOTSI:  That was Doctor Ngubani saying sorry about 
who we are contracting with you and not with ENS. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And he is speaking to Mr? 
MR TSOTSI:  Mr Linnell yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair.  Then there is the 
last question on this.  Time spent, 1hour 07 and.23 
seconds.  Give me the page reference?  It is on page 743 
of the transcript, timestamp 1.07.23. 
AUDIO PLAYED INTO THE RECORD – INAUDIBLE

09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 77 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when you say we, the mandate we  
would like to give.  Who are you referring to as the we? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am referring to the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the members of the board are still 
present. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, they are present and listening and 
discussing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And is there any objection to that 
statement? 
MR TSOTSI:   None at all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you know that he said Chair, speak 
for yourself when you said to the mandate, we want to give 
you, nobody said think for yourself, it is not what we want 
to do. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact, we heard earlier the voice you 
identified as that of Dr Ngubane saying Nick, we are 
contracting with you, not with ENS.  Correct?   
 
Now let us see, because we have a copy of the 
20 
minutes of the meeting, of this meeting.  Let us see who 
was present according to the minutes of that meeting, in 
this meeting.  That minute is on page 675. 
MR TSOTSI:   Got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have it.  Page 675, it is a minute

this 
session 
of 
the 
People 
in 
Governance 
Committee, we, as a board invited any member who was 
interested other than a member of this committee was 
welcome to come into the meeting and participate hence

appear here.  So …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Tsotsi, we have got two

20 
trying to resolve to the Chairperson.  Let us see, there are

MR TSOTSI:   Okay, that is not board meeting, in-
committee.

ADV SELEKA SC:   It is also on the 11 March but this 
10 
board in-committee meeting.

ADV SELEKA SC:   11 March 2015 at 12.00. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this would have preceded the P & G 
Meeting of the minutes we referred to earlier.

ADV SELEKA SC:    So present in this meeting is yourself, 
Mr Tsotsi, the Chairman of the Board, Dr Ngubane, Ms V

MR TSOTSI:   The last person is the same Nick Linnell 
whose voice we heard not long ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So all these persons were present 
during that discussion.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now these minutes, if you turn to page 
670, where supposed to have signed and please, you could 
indicate to the Chairperson who signed and which date. 
MR TSOTSI:     Chair, the minutes were signed by Dr 
Ngubane on the 18 November 2016. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Again, nearly two years after the 
actual meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of 11 March 2015.  Now if we look at 
the 
charge, 
the 
first 
charge 
levelled 
against 
you 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi, have you had an opportunity  
of reading these minutes and are you able to say whether, 
20 
although it has been quite some time, whether they seem 
to reflect the discussions and decisions in that meeting 
because you chaired the meeting or are there any areas in 
the minutes that cause you concern? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think having had the benefit of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 81 of 220 
 
audio it helped in, you know, jogging the memory very well 
and insofar as the substance of the minutes, I am fine, I do 
not have any… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have any issues. 
MR TSOTSI:   Any issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, that is fine. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Chair, 
perhaps 
I 
could 
read 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just wanted to clear that out of the way 
because there were those other minutes where you had an 
10 
issue about. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which were also signed close to two 
years after the date of the meeting.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Well, Mr 
Tsotsi, perhaps one could quickly take you through the 
minutes.  You are still on page – you will have to be on 
page 668, under paragraph 7.1.  Are you there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, there are bullet points there, I will 
20 
read – let us see, “it was proposed”, the first one: 
“A number of issues were raised in the in-committee 
session being as follows: 
It was proposed that the P & G committee indicate a 
process and that audit and risk committee be 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 82 of 220 
 
responsible for the ultimate forensic element of the 
inquiry.  It was agreed. 
Confirmed the [indistinct] 11.26 of that, the audit 
and risk committee be the custodian of the process 
and to engage with other committees where it was 
necessary to do so.  The Chairman highlighted the 
view that it may be necessary for employees whose 
11.38 are implicated .39 be requested to step aside.  
Whilst the inquiry was proceeding a question was 
asked about what effect this would have on the 
10 
operations 
of 
the 
business. 
 
Members 
also 
discussed the possible impact on continuity this 
approach would have on the company’s business 
activities.  It was noted that there had been a trust 
deficit and that people may be to blame but not 
want the truth to be found and findings to be made.  
The Chairman outlined a number of misdemeanours 
allegedly committed by some executives.” 
Is that correct, Mr Tsotsi, that you outlined a number of 
misdemeanours? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I did not outline the misdemeanours, 
what happened was, these were statements that I made by 
people during the meeting and I then indicated in the 
summary that these are the things that people are saying.  
I did not outline any misdemeanours, I do not recall doing 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 83 of 220 
 
that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We will find a portion for me 
relative to this aspect in the recording.  So you deny that 
you outlined misdemeanours? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I did not outline any misdemeanours that 
relates to the individuals.  I do not recall that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no that is alright.  There is an 
allegation about a trust deficit.  
“It was noted that there had been trust deficit and 
that people may be to blame but not want the truth 
10 
to be found and findings to be made.” 
You know what they are referring to here? 
MR TSOTSI:      I suspect that in the discussion – because 
what this is doing, is recording what different people were 
saying 
and 
what 
- 
you 
know, 
what 
views 
they 
are 
expressing. 
 
I 
rather 
suspect 
that 
on 
the basis 
of 
allegations of wrongdoing by some of the people that would 
be a trust deficit in that regard.  I am not sure what the 
reference this is making in terms of any board is saying or 
any board concurrence about any of this.  There is no 
20 
concurrence on the board that was given in terms of a trust 
deficit because, I mean, the board did not know the 
individuals.  The board had not worked with the individuals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the individuals you are referring to 
are the executives in this case? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 84 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   The executives, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – and then it carries on: 
“It was pointed out that these issues needed to be 
investigated forensically but that the executives 
were responsible for those areas not be around 
during the inquiry.” 
One could carry on but I need to ask you whether – again 
the same question.  I mean, the minutes are signed many 
months later after this meeting.  The question is whether 
did you – were your furnished with a copy of these 
10 
microscope for approval before the 30 March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I was not, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I have gone through the minutes but I 
could not find these – what you were indicating to the 
Chairperson earlier, a resolution that would indicate that 
Mr Nick Linnell was appointed. 
MR TSOTSI:      No, there was no resolution, what 
happened was that the committee, the board accepted the 
fact that Nick should assist the two committees.  There was 
no resolution as such that was singed or provided by the 
20 
board to that effect.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So was Nick Mr Linnell?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Formally appointed or not by the 
board?   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 85 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, there was no formal appointment of 
Nick because there was no documentation to the effect that 
he was appointed but the board were quite happy to use 
his service and so implicitly he was engaged by the board 
because the board continued to have him assist in different 
roles and different aspects for the preparation of this 
inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, I am going to move on unless 
there is a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can move on. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Then if you turn to your 
affidavit where you are dealing with the first charge 
levelled against you, that is on page 21.  Page 21 
paragraph 18, one eight, it says: 
“Board meeting of 30 March 2015 charges laid by the 
Board against me.  Charge 1, the director procured 
the services ...” 
The director is that – who are they referring to? 
MR TSOTSI:   They are referring to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...”procure the services of an external 
20 
consultant Mr Nick Linnell to provide consulting services to 
the company without following the company’s prescribed 
procurement processes or informing the Board – or informing 
the Board of his actions, in so doing the Director crossed the 
line from being a non-Executive Director to exercising 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 86 of 220 
 
executive power without the requisite authority.” 
 
Now your comment on that, did you procure the 
services yourself of Mr Linnell? 
MR TSOTSI:   No I did not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you fail to inform the Board about 
your actions to procure the services – well to have Mr Linnell 
engaged as a consultant? 
MR TSOTSI:   No I had no reason to inform the Board about 
something that did not happen, the Board knew what Linnell 
had been doing and what his role was, the Board welcomed 
10 
that role. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how did you react to this charge, 
because we hear in the clip that you are there with the Board 
members talking to Mr Nick Linnell and agreeing to him 
being contracted by the Board, how did you react to this? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair if I can just read my response, I mean 
there’s nothing ...[indistinct] my reaction.  I placed the 
history of Nick Linnell’s activities, from the time of the 9 t h 
March Board meeting, the support he gave to both the Board 
and ...[indistinct] and the P & G sub-committees.  P & G 
20 
declined to deal with the matter of Linnell’s appointment, at 
least they preferred that the Board handle it.   Mr Linnell 
could only be considered employed by the Board if he had a 
written letter or contract signed by the Chairman, or had 
received some remuneration or compensation for the work he 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 87 of 220 
 
had done for the Board.  That was my response. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Charge 2 on page 22 I think that’s where 
you are, paragraph 18.3 reads: 
“The consultant commenced with his work to the 
knowledge of the director and without the Board of 
Directors 
being 
informed 
that 
the 
work 
had 
commenced within the company.  The director was 
aware that 
no 
contract of 
engagement for the 
consultant had been concluded, thus exposing the 
company to non-compliance with the FICA statutes 
10 
and procedures.” 
And how I see your responses there how did you deal with 
this allegation? 
MR TSOTSI:   Like I said Nick was merely assisting the 
Board on a pro bono basis at that point, and if he had to 
commence work this would only have been possible and 
triggered by some action of engagement by either myself or 
the Board and incidentally I also indicated to the Board that 
by the same token Mr Khumalo was a board member 
organised a media specialist, Mr ...[indistinct] Ntshingela, to 
20 
review a media statement that had been produced by the  & 
G on precisely the same basis that Nick had been assisting 
the P & G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi we are dealing with the charges 
but unless I missed something I think we may have skipped 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 88 of 220 
 
the part that reflects how the Board appeared to turn on Mr 
Tsotsi on its own ...[indistinct] just tell me how we got to the 
charges, in other words I think there was a meeting, there 
was a lot of discussion and people said certain things before 
you got to the stage where charges were formulated.  I think 
that part is important to see how you moved – the meeting 
moved from a certain point where it seemed to be going fine, 
no problems with the Chairperson and how later on it 
changed.   
 
So if we haven’t covered that I think we – it’s 
10 
important to cover that development. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair, yes and indeed that is not 
apparent on the documentation Mr Tsotsi so you will have to 
give the Chairperson some insight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I may have read it somewhere, Mr 
Tsotsi do you know what I am talking about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a part how the whole thing 
seemed to develop so it might or might or not be in this 
statement 
but 
as 
you 
read 
you 
wonder 
how 
is 
this 
20 
happening, what is happening, what has changed.  So you 
say you know what I am talking about.    
MR TSOTSI:    Yes Chair I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you want to tell us about what that – 
you know you must have felt at a certain stage since the 9t h 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 89 of 220 
 
of March, since that meeting, how the Board maybe seemed 
to be with you and maybe at a certain stage on the 11t h of 
March and the exactly when you began to see a change of 
attitude ultimately how everything then went up to charges 
being formulated, that is the impression I have from what I 
have read, that there is that development you know, but you 
must tell me if you don’t know what I am talking about. 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes Chair, what  happened is that after the 
conclusion of the suspensions I then agreed – the Board 
agreed that there should be a press conference to announce 
10 
the suspensions and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe before you do that, at the 
meeting of the 9t h of March you did – I mean that meeting 
you said was very brief. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, because the Board decided they 
would like to have the Minister address them. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now at that meeting did you sense any 
attitude, any negative attitude towards you on the part of any 
20 
members of the Board? 
MR TSOTSI:    Chairman I can comfortably say no, there 
wasn’t any attitude, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  During the – then you go to the 11t h 
of March. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 90 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said there was a meeting of the Board 
before the Minister arrived, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that part of the meeting – that meeting 
of the Board before the Minister arrived did everything go 
smoothly? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes Chair everything went well, to the extent 
that the Board was insistent that I should Chair the P & G 
meeting which would then be dealing with the issue of 
10 
suspensions.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Obviously as Chairman I would not ordinarily 
chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[indistinct]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, but because the Board acceded and this 
is very interesting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The Board acceded that they really didn’t 
know much about the organisation, the people involved and 
20 
so on, so it ...[indistinct] that they were more comfortable if I 
was leading the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which is what then happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 91 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   And this happened also within production of 
Nick Linnell as we heard on the tape and as I say the 
conclusion of the suspensions up to that point there was no 
indication of any discomfort with me or anything remotely 
related to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just remind me what were the 
important decisions that were taken by the Board at that 
meeting, before the meeting with the Minister if there were 
decisions that were taken or was it just a briefing? 
MR TSOTSI:   The meeting before the Minister had – this is 
10 
now the in-committee meeting, because there were two 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  So I will not – I will only deal with the one, with 
the in-committee meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   That meeting deliberated quite extensively on 
how to deal with the issue of suspension and what the 
impact of this might be and so on, so there was quite a 
robust discussion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also the issue of the inquiry, I guess. 
MR TSOTSI:   On the issue of the inquiry yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I recall maybe the ...[indistinct] will 
correct me here on the basis of the sequence of events, but 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 92 of 220 
 
by the time the Minister was due to speak to the Board, by 
the time she had arrived the Board had taken the position 
that it would like to explore what – rather entertain what the 
Minister report is going to be on the specific issue of the 
inquiry and that it would then wait for the Minister’s inputs 
before it takes – makes a determination as to which way to 
go. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the meeting did not make any final 
decision on the – and on the suspensions of the Executives, 
I am now talking about the meeting before the Minister 
10 
arrived, but there was a discussion on these issues and the 
meeting said we would like to hear the Minister’s input on 
these issues before we make, we take a final decision. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the position Chair ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And at that meeting everything was going 
smoothly. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There seemed to be no animosity towards 
you on the part of anybody in the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes,  you wanted to emphasize earlier on 
that the point about when the – when that meeting was 
concluded, 
you 
wanted 
to 
say 
something 
about 
the 
Executives and I think I interrupted you.  I think there was 
something you wanted to say as to what the meeting was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 93 of 220 
 
saying about the suspension of executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay if I remember well there was no set 
feeling about suspensions, there was no conclusive thinking 
that the executives should be actually suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:    So the affirmation of suspensions happened 
after the meeting with the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I think that is an important observation 
from my perspective. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say that that 
meeting before the Minister arrived was used to inform the 
members of the Board as much as possible about this issue 
of the inquiry and the suspensions without them being asked 
to make any decisions because the Minister was still coming 
to a point to address them. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be correct ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then there was the next meeting was the 
meeting between the Board and the Minister, is that right? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a board meeting at which the Minister 
was invited? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 94 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   And when the Minister came in, she 
addressed the Board and she pronounced herself on the 
suspensions and on the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And gave the Board what would be a leeway 
of nine days to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  With both the inquiry and the requisite 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And during the time when the Minister 
10 
was there the members of the Board participated in a 
discussion and there was discussion on these issues or they 
just allowed the Minister to address them with a view that 
they will have their own deliberations after the Minister had 
left. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, the Board members engaged with the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They engaged with her. 
MR TSOTSI:   They asked various questions and even other 
issues outside of the inquiry issue, you know ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you chaired that meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  The Minister had committed at the 
induction that she would like to be able to see the Board on 
a reasonably regular basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 95 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Touch base on how the Board is doing and 
how things are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
MR TSOTSI:   She is pretty much in touch with the business 
of the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So this was one of those occasions where the 
Minister used that opportunity just to talk a bit about some of 
her thoughts about what situations are facing her and from 
her perspective. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, now by the time the Minister had to 
leave I take it no decisions were taken while the Minister 
was there? 
MR TSOTSI:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but was it pretty clear which way the 
Board seemed to be going in regard to suspensions and the 
inquiry? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was clear Chair because nobody on the 
Board either countermanded what the Minister was saying or 
gave a different view from hers, so one you know had the 
20 
distinct feeling that the Board is going along with the 
thinking on this issue of the inquiry and the suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now the Minister then left. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the Board continued on their 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 96 of 220 
 
own, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct the Board continued and the 
engagement was quite robust. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And at the end of it there was a decision that 
the Board then made and the Board said that they would 
entertain the setting aside of the three executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which was basically suspensions? 
MR TSOTSI:   Suspensions yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say of the three executives? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:    If I recall well yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and when is there four? 
MR TSOTSI:   The fourth came into the picture in the early 
afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so, oh, I though the Minister 
added the fourth one earlier. 
MR TSOTSI:   The Minister might have – I stand to be 
corrected here, the Minister might have made reference to 
four executives, but what I seem to recall was that there was 
a push-back, certainly from me there was a push-back 
20 
against having the Financial Director included in that.  I 
would have to confirm Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, unless I am confusing, was the 
Financial Director’s name added at the Durban meeting?  
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 97 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Because I think I have heard 
evidence or I have read somewhere where I think it was – I 
think it was either Mr Matona or yourself, said the minister 
added the financial director’s name which had not been 
included ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   That could be possible my affidavit, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, you wanted to assist? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is in Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tsotsi’s.  Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Where he says that we – the minister 
10 
joined the meeting, mandated the board to carry out the 
suspensions of the executives.  She even added of the name 
of the financial director who was not part of the original 
three executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And that is at the time when she was 
the minister attending this meeting of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So it was four executives that 
were being discussed after that minister added that name?  
MR TSOTSI:   Okay alright.  Now after the minister had left, 
20 
the discussion continued and the atmosphere, did you detect 
any negative or hostile attitude towards you on the part of 
any members of the board at that stage? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, there was – during this meeting it was 
pushed back against the director of – the financial director 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 98 of 220 
 
being part of the executives.  I think, if I recall well 
Pamensky was also there and uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uncomfortable about that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, about having the FD ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR TSOTSI:   And for reasons which I agreed with him.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   I.e. as the custodian of the company’s 
10 
finances.  The FD had the financial position of Eskom, it was 
very precarious at the time.  And this would in fact reflect 
negatively, as well as, the fact, you know, the finance 
division is the one that dispenses funds to the others for 
operational reasons and, you know, it does not merit the 
inclusion into the inquiry to the extent there could be a need 
to do it.  So the discussion kept going back and forth 
regarding that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I recall speaking to David.  I think I raised 
20 
the issue of speaking to the minister on the phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  
MR TSOTSI:   And seriously questioning why we should be 
adding the finance director.  And the minister retorted it that 
maybe we should do as, you know, as we have been guided 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 99 of 220 
 
in terms of who the executives should be suspended.  So 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When she was at the meeting of the board 
and she added the name of the financial director.  Before 
she left the meeting, did anybody say what has the financial 
director done?  Why are you – why must we add her?  Did 
anybody say that?  And if there was, how was – how did the 
minister respond? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, there was nobody who raised that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody who raised that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
raised 
it 
telephonically 
afterwards, later with the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the same day? 
MR TSOTSI:   On the same day, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And effectively, you were questioning 
why 
the 
financial 
director 
should 
be 
included 
in 
the 
suspensions. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did she give you reasons why the 
financial director should be included? 
MR TSOTSI:   She did not give me concrete reasons.  All she 
said to me is that we should proceed as in the manner that 
we have been advised to proceed. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 100 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Advised by her? 
MR TSOTSI:   By her, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she comes to the board.  The board 
has got three names of executives to be suspended.  She 
adds another name.  When you ask her why, she does not 
give you reasons but she says, in effect, the board must do 
as I have said it should do. 
MR TSOTSI:   In effect, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But going back to the atmosphere 
towards you ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...at that point now.  They were talking 
about the meeting of the board after the minister had left.  
Was there anything that suggested that there was a negative 
or hostile or unfriendly attitude towards you by members of 
the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think when I began to sense 
something when the push back happened against the 
suspensions of the FD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Some board members who had decidedly firm 
about no we cannot exclude.  Should not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now you were against – you are 
against the inclusion of the financial director.  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 101 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying, you are not the only 
one.  There were a number of other members of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   This was the spectrum if people were to be 
removed from their offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Or should not be at their offices for the 
duration of the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   As I am saying, notwithstanding that, there 
was still quite some discussion about – let us not forget the 
10 
intend.  The intend is not to punish these people.  The intend 
is not to prejudice them and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   And there question, you know, that were 
asked by one or two different members as there to, really, is 
there no really no way to avoid using the suspension route.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.  This happened especially when Nick was 
now part of the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
20 
MR TSOTSI:   So... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so at the end of that meeting, 
namely the one which came after the minister had left, at the 
end of that meeting, you were sensing something but nothing 
concrete or...? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 102 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair I was sensing.  There is something 
else that happened in that meeting which incidentally is not 
recorded ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...which gave me quite a bit of apprehension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which kind of clouded my mood all together.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I do not understand why.  And this is 
important Chair in my view.  I see no reason why this 
10 
particular conversation is not part of the recordal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because the recordal system was there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   They were in the same room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And if there were audio problems, the 
technicians are there to take care of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Now the issue I am talking about is the 
20 
discussion about the people who were supposed to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who were? 
MR TSOTSI:   Supposed to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To act, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  That discussion took a strange turn in 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 103 of 220 
 
my view.  First of all, the purpose, amongst others, of the 
PNG Committee was to come up with the names of the 
people who were supposed to act in the places of this 
executives to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   What happened was, I came across names 
that had been produced from somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the first question I asked is:  Where on 
earth do these names come from because none of you in this 
10 
meeting know anything about the executives at Eskom to the 
extent that you can say that this was a disqualified worth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the response I got was that these names 
came from the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And specifically, this was a response that I got 
from Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Now I was taken aback because the minister 
20 
does not know anything about who is – got the capacity or 
the capability of acting.  She would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So immediately I had the sense that there is 
some hand here, external hand that is driving this particular 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 104 of 220 
 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   This applied to the three of the executives.  
That is Finance, that is Group Capital and that was 
Commercial and Technology.  Now when it came to the chief 
executive, the suggestion was that Zethemba Xhosa should 
act.   
 
Now I have a very clear recollection of the fact that 
Zethemba said immediately that he does not feel he is up to 
it.   
10 
 
And Zethemba just came from, I mean, at that time, I 
think he was involved with Telkom somewhere, in Telkom’s 
business.   
 
And there was a dismissal of his concern that:  No, go 
ahead.  You will be fine.  You should do it.  And I was 
uncomfortable with that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And quite frankly, I felt that he was out of his 
debts.  Admittedly, I did not know him but I did not have a 
comfort level and I have engaged with him for the brief time 
20 
that I did but, you know, this would be something he could 
deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   I will not cast any aspersions on his 
performance as acting CE.  I mean, that what I used to do.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 105 of 220 
 
But I am just saying that was my feeling at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I am saying Chairman that that exercise 
and the way it was pushed made me begin to wonder what 
actually is going on.  For the first time I had a sense that 
something was afoot.  So that is when I felt that there are 
things beginning to go in a direction which I – is not a 
positive direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But that is now, you say, at the 
meeting of the People in Governance Committee? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not the same, or is it that meeting 
that happened after the minister had gone? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the meeting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is an extension of that meeting because 
the board had a discussion after the Minister left and then in 
the afternoon went into the People in Governance meeting, I 
think it started at – what was it, half past two or something 
like that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I think earlier on you may have 
said that the board decided that the board at the meeting 
immediately after the minister had left, the board decided 
that certain issues should be dealt with by the People in 
Governance Committee.  Is that right? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 106 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The suspensions.  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is now the execution.  Was that 
going to be the execution in ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the decision had been made? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then the question of who were 
going to act in the position of the executives to be 
10 
suspended that that was one of the issues that the board 
said should go to the People in Governance Committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And the People in Governance 
Committee, did it happen after lunch? 
MR TSOTSI:   It happened after lunch, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because yesterday you said you went to 
lunch and when you came back you were ten minutes late to 
that meeting.  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So but by the end of the 
meeting by the board that happened after the minister had 
left, the position is that you had sensed something but 
nothing concrete as yet about the board’s attitude towards 
you or some members of the board, their attitude towards 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 107 of 220 
 
you or not really? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not really.  Not by the end of the board 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was only at the People in Governance 
Committee that you began to sense that there was some 
other hand? 
MR TSOTSI:   Before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, because the board... I am trying to 
remember now Chair at what point the push back... No, I 
think you are correct.  I have got the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...the sequence wrong.  Yes, the push back 
against the FD, I think occurred after the meeting with the 
minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because it was a full board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That gave you ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   So that is when... yes, you are correct.  That 
is when I began to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You started sensing ...[intervenes]  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 108 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   ...to sense that something is not right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But nothing concrete.  But just 
a sense? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then at the People in Governance 
Committee meeting, did you begin to have any – feel 
anything concrete or did you – was your sense did it become 
stronger that there was something and was it just about 
something or also the attitude towards to you?  Did it begin 
to change or not really? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, Chair as I have said, you know, the way 
the acting roles were dealt with simply heightened the 
apprehension now that I started to develop.  It really pushed 
it to a point where I now said to myself surely there is 
something afoot here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I was convinced without any 
reasonable doubt that there was no way anybody in the 
entire board other than myself, except of course for the 
executives ...[indistinct] 
directors 
on the 
board.  The 
20 
executive directors, there was no one else who knew 
...[indistinct] better than I did, and I knew who would be 
suitable for that role.  So that straight away just pushed me 
into the apprehension mode and started to wonder what on 
earth is going on.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 109 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but at that stage you were just sensing 
that there was something and some outside hand outside of 
the committee or the board but you were not sensing 
anything towards you as chairperson in a negative way. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that I think is fair to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was not sensing anything towards me 
specifically 
but 
that 
there 
was 
something 
on 
the 
go 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   ...which I could not really fathom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  That meeting of the People in 
Governance Committee, it ended with an endorsement of the 
names that you were told had been given by the minister as 
the people who would act in the positions of the executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was confirmed? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And were you given no answer with 
regard to:  But you people do not know these people.  The 
20 
only answer you were given was that the minister gave these 
names. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you said but the minister would 
not know those people themselves, nobody said anything 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 110 of 220 
 
when you said that? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Now this part that I am 
talking about where it seemed that the board was turning on 
you, it may be that you did give evidence about it previously 
and that is where I am getting it from.  Did you cover that 
when you gave evidence previously about how you were 
kicked out? 
MR TSOTSI:   I probably referred to my own suspension 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...as an indication Chair that the board has 
turned against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, have you had the chance to 
look at the previous evidence?  Do you know whether it was 
covered?  Because I do not want us to cover something that 
we have covered? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I think I have read his testimony at 
the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  You are not sure about it. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But it doesn’t ring a bell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It doesn’t ring a bell? 
ADV SELEKA SC   Immediately ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  You remember there is a meeting 
where you came with a lawyer to the board meeting? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 111 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And there were discussions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is when he is already in the 
suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did you – do you think you have 
covered that last time when you gave evidence?   I just want 
to make sure that we do not leave out something important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   I don’t recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you know what I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you know what I am talking about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I know what you are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting was in the evening and I 
think your counsel was Advocate Kassiem if I am not 
mistaken. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Nazeer Cassim. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Okay I know where you are. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know... ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So basically, I just want you to cover.  At 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 112 of 220 
 
what stage the board began to accuse you of doing this or 
that or not doing that and that and beginning to say you 
brought 
in 
somebody 
without 
authority 
or 
without 
procurement, it talks about Mr Linnell, and then when then 
they started to basically put you in the dock and then up to 
the end? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me just quickly cover that Chair if I 
may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just so we can bridge that gap. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Following the day of the suspensions and then 
there was – they said there was a press conference the 
following day.  That would have been around the... what is it, 
the 12t h, 13t h, maybe?  But there was a time then when 
Linnell was focussing his attention now with assisting the 
ARC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the Audit and Risk Committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Audit and Risk Committee.  Now Nick reported 
to me that on the morning of the 17 t h, that was now at about 
20 
04:20 a.m.  We received an email from the secretariat who 
said to him:  Look, your scheduled meeting with the 
committee of Audit and Risk has been – you are no longer 
required to attend that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 113 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   And essentially, the people that he was due to 
interact with that day, everybody seemed to stand off and 
there was a point where he had an arrangement to meet with 
Ms Mabude as part of the work that he was doing.  I think 
that meeting also got cancelled or something to that effect.  
And he does say in his evidence, I do not know where it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Should I assist, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please.  Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With page references? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on – from page 152 Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I just realise now that we have gone past 
one o’clock.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us eat.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But let us quickly, you know, just cover 
this part.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   The evidence leader has promised to buy me 
lunch Chair because I did not want to bring my lunch today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I offered to do that, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Yes, 157. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His affidavit Chairperson, the relevant 
section that Mr Tsotsi is referring to are on page 152 and 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 114 of 220 
 
153. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   At page 151, gives you the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So if you look at page 152 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, this is the earlier affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Mr Nick Linnell’s affidavit to this 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Yes, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says at paragraph 34 – so he is 
explaining 151.  He comes out of the meeting.  There is a 
press conference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The press conference, Mr Tsotsi 
announces 
the 
suspensions. 
 
Announces 
him 
being 
appointed as the coordinator.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then he deals with what happens 
20 
thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   He then, because he is appointed as the 
coordinator, he receives... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 115 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 34: 
“Following 
that, 
I 
received 
a 
number 
of 
communications from Eskom including an invitation 
from Mr Naidoo...” 
 
I think that should be Dr Naidoo. 
“...a director to join the board, recovery and build 
programme 
review 
committee, 
workshop 
the 
following 
week. 
 
His 
communication 
with 
that 
committee 
included 
reference 
to 
the 
board’s 
intention to commit a deep dive investigation.  This 
10 
is relevant to the recognition that the inquiry was 
underway.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then he receives some invitation to 
attend the Audit and Risk Sub-committee, 19 and 23r d.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
“On the 12 of March, Minister Brown releases a 
media statement dealing with the suspension of the 
– rather the inquiry.  And I was about that time 
20 
required to provide my proposed draft terms of 
reference.” 
 
Now that is all around the 12t h of March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you go to page 153. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 116 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Paragraph 40.  He says then: 
“I then emailed the first draft of the terms of 
reference to Ms Mabude.  Then the company 
secretary on Sunday, 15 March 2015.” 
 
Paragraph 41: 
“On the evening of Monday, the 16t h, I had a 
discussion Ms Mabude regarding the terms of 
reference which I had submitted.  That discussion 
was brief, I was concerned that Ms Mabude now 
10 
refused to allow me access to the input received 
from the executives.  There was a notable cooling of 
enthusiasm.  That conversation ended with an 
agreement that I would meet Ms Mabude the 
following morning at around midday, 17 March.” 
 
Then this is what Mr Tsotsi is talking about: 
“At 04:50 am on the 17t h of March, I received an 
email from Mr Thulo Selele copied to the company 
secretary reporting to inform me that the Board 
Audit and Risk and Compliance Committee would 
20 
now be handling the forensic FIT finding inquiry.  I 
assumed it to be referring to an inquiry I was 
preparing for.  I was informed that I was no longer 
required to attend the meeting previously arranged.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so maybe I got a lot of information 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 117 of 220 
 
from this affidavit because you can see that there seems to 
be a change in attitude towards Mr Linnell as well.  And I 
think either simultaneously or soon thereafter, there seems 
to be negative or hostile attitude on the part of the board 
towards Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right, Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, answer the Chair ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Yes, Chair that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   By what you want to say Evidence Leader.  
But I was going to say it is then three days later, essentially 
two days later on the 19t h that the committee then first 
indicated that I was going to be charged for whatever the 
reason they gave at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   That was now patently clear that something 
had been happening and that between the 16t h and the 19t h, 
something very specific happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Now I do not know if this appears in this 
affidavit but Mr Linnell has its own view of what had 
happened on the night of the 16t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which he... well, he shared this with me at 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 118 of 220 
 
some point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   What is the reference there of that specific... I 
just want to make sure I am... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, what do you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where he gave his taking of what 
happened. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I think it is somewhere... is it in this 
affidavit?  I have seen it in one of his documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you tell Mr Seleka what it is 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...he might know where to find it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Chair, what Nick said was that he 
heard that there was a secret meeting that night with some 
of the board members were in attendance together with... 
well, it says the suspended executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And Salim Essa is said to have been at that 
meeting together with Tony Gupta. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   There is no indication of what was discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   But there is a clear indication of what 
transpired.  It seems to be the impact ...[intervenes]  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 119 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...of whatever was discussed at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   It certainly had a direct impact on what Nic 
Linnell was supposed to be doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And ultimately, I think, on what I... my own 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because it was on the 19t h that... of the 
10 
board, the 19t h board meeting, that the whole issue of 
accusations against me began. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Okay alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, we... if it is here on affidavit 
one would look at it but you can highlight what you think you 
have not highlighted in relation to your removal if... whatever 
you think you might not have highlighted that you would like 
to highlight to say out of the process, out of my removal 
here, the important things that I would like to highlight.   
20 
 
So but maybe we could take the lunch break and then 
when you come back, then you can quickly deal with that and 
then we moved towards what Mr Seleka wanted to cover.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But during the lunch break would give you 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 120 of 220 
 
a chance to reflect on what you think is it that you think is 
quite important in relation to your removal that you would 
like to highlight.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that alright? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let take the lunch break 
now.  We will resume at half-past two.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you may proceed.  We have taken 
much longer than you anticipated, Mr Seleka, yesterday 
with Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I believe that the issues that we 
have canvassed were important issues that needed to be 
covered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But probably we should be able to finish 
20 
within an hour from now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we took the break, I said, Mr 
Tsotsi, there may be some important features of the 
journey to our ultimate removal that happened that you 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 121 of 220 
 
might wish to emphasise.  If you would like to emphasise 
some features of that episode, this is your chance. 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you, Chair, I will try to be as 
expedient as possible.  I want to focus from the 19 t h which 
is the time when – or the date when the issue of the 
suspensions came.   
First of all, I was extremely surprised when I was 
asked 
to 
recuse 
myself 
from 
that 
meeting, 
this 
in-
committee meeting …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was a meeting of the board or the 
10 
audit and risk committee or some other committee? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was an in-committee of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Whereupon my supposed 
suspension or my supposed charges were going to be 
discussed and …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, Mr Tsotsi, are you referring to 
the meeting of the 19 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chair, meeting of the 19 
March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Of March 2015? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   19 March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 122 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   And by this time my state of mind, Chairman, 
was that the only thing I really have to do is to focus on 
defending myself in this situation.  So I was effectively a 
rudderless Chairman from that point onwards because the 
board was making decisions in my absence. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now when was the last time you chaired 
a meeting of the board?  Which meeting was the last one 
that you chaired? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was on the same day but it was an 
ordinary board meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the 19 t h. 
MR TSOTSI:   On the 19 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the morning. 
MR TSOTSI:   In the morning, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and then that went well while 
you were chairing or that is where things began to unfold 
that led to your ultimate …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:    Well, there was not much that was being 
shown but I already had a sense that there was beginnings 
of disconnect.  In fact, I was – I should say this, before – 
20 
before then, I was receiving emails from one or two of the 
board members which were demanding me to answer to 
different things which they thought that I am not – I did not 
do or did not accomplish.  I unfortunately do not recall any 
of these emails nor do I have copies of them but I do recall 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 123 of 220 
 
that there were to some degree somewhat hostile.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to remember from which 
members of the board they came from? 
MR TSOTSI:   I remember from Mark Pamensky in 
particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, he was particularly the one who was 
vociferous about whatever it was that was concerning him 
or concerning me at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   unfortunately, as I say, I just do not recall 
exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I remember the sentiment for sure.  So it 
was clear that there was something that was afoot.  So by 
the time they came along with the charges I pretty much 
knew that I was up against something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say it was clear that there was 
something, you mean at that meeting of the in-committee – 
at that in-committee meeting on the morning of the 19 t h? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I think the in-committee took place in 
the afternoon, I think.  The ordinary board meeting was in 
the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ordinary board meeting was on the 
19 t h? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 124 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the meeting where you say it 
became clear that there was something?  Is that the one? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it did not become clear, the clarify came 
when they actually preferred the charges against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell the story. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me not interrupt you. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Following then, the issue where I was 
asked to recuse myself because they wanted to discuss 
me, I did not resist or put up any - you know, any struggle 
of any kind and I simply said fine, let us go ahead.   
And when they reverted back to me – I have to now 
recall precisely, maybe the minutes may say so, they then 
issued out this document with – or informed me that they 
were going to put some charges against me and I think I 
recall that I actually got the formal document on a Sunday 
by email or, no, it was not by email it was actually hand 
20 
delivered but I did not get a corresponding email. 
Then the next thing that I recall happening was that 
they then made a decision to go and brief the Minister 
about their intent to ask me to step aside as a director and 
they once again, I was not invited to that meeting, I was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 125 of 220 
 
not even informed about it, I just heard from the company 
secretary that they have gone to Cape Town to go and 
meet with the Minister.  I have yet to see the minutes of 
that meeting, I do not know whether in fact we have copies 
of that meeting but I really do not know, that meeting 
happened possibly between the 19 t h and maybe the 22 n d, 
something like that, somewhere there. 
So at this point, Chair, I am simply just floating, not 
being engaged in the business, I tried to do what I thought 
I should be doing but there was no response really from 
10 
the board, they were having their own interactions among 
themselves.  I do not recall when next they had a board 
meeting but that we can establish somehow.  But, as was 
the previous case, I was now essentially not invited to – 
rather, let me put it this way, board meetings were not 
being convened by myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now on the 19 t h, that ordinary board 
meeting, you say they asked you to leave the meeting 
because they wanted to discuss you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that time, you were charging the 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When they asked you to excuse yourself. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 126 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was there a Deputy of Vice-
Chairperson of the board or there was no Deputy of Vice-
Chairperson of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, there was no such position. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
so 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
Chairperson, 
what 
would 
happen, 
would 
the 
board 
members elect a Chairperson for the time being? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, they would not really elect but they 
would decide …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would just decide, ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That a particular individual can chair the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Did you get to hear 
at any stage who was chairing their meetings in your 
absence?  At that time did you get to hear from one source 
or another? 
MR TSOTSI:   I heard the name of Ben Ngubane 
mentioned, Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And really, I cannot say …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot say for sure. 
MR TSOTSI:   For sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you stepped out of the meeting, they 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 127 of 220 
 
had their discussion, did they call you back at some stage 
on the same day? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think so, I do not know the in-committee 
meetings what they say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, thank you, the answers 
you are asking – I mean, the questions you are asking may 
be answered by the document itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The minute of the meeting which is 
10 
found on page 679. 
CHAIRPERSON:   679. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we did refer to parts of the 
minutes and aspects the Chairperson is dealing with 
appear further down in those minutes.  So at page 679, Mr 
Tsotsi, of the bundle, is a copy of Eskom – now it says 
here Minutes of the Eskom Holdings Special Board In-
Committee Meeting of 19 March 2015.  Now it does not 
specify the time but you will see later on that this is late at 
night.  The members present are there, we went through 
20 
that list.   You must be on page 679.  On which page are 
you, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am on – sorry, on page 679, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, so the list of the members are 
present there, you are the Chairperson, as indicated.  Can 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 128 of 220 
 
you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dr Ngubane is also present, we have 
gone through that list.  The questions the Chairperson is 
asking you, turn the page to 681.  At the middle of the 
page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, I can see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  At the middle of the page you 
have Mr Kumalo joined the meeting, resolution by the 
board.  Do you see that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then break and resumed at 23.40.  
That is twenty to twelve, before midnight.  The Chairman 
was excused from the meeting, Dr Ngubane was elected to 
chair the meeting.  You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then I think you come back on the next 
page, page 682.  The Chairman then came back to the 
meeting at 12.37.  Mr Tsotsi, that is…? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, yes, I see that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that twenty-three minutes before 
one o’clock? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 129 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   After midnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That looks like you were out of the 
meeting for about an hour or so? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, just short of an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and it does appear from the 
minutes that Dr Ngubane was elected Chairperson after 
you had left. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And yet you did come back but the 
minutes do not appear to indicate what you were told when 
you came back. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember what – whether you 
were told anything? 
MR TSOTSI:   My recollection, Chairman, is that I was told 
that the charges that have been – that are going to be 
brought against me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  At that stage you were not given 
20 
any particulars as to what the charges were? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you came back you were not 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 130 of 220 
 
allowed to take the chair. 
MR TSOTSI:   I did not take the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I may, Chair?  Mr Tsotsi, why did you 
have to recuse yourself from the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, I did not literally recuse myself but 
they asked me…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, why were you excused?  I beg 
your pardon, they used the word excused from the meeting. 
“Chairman was excused from the meeting.” 
10 
Why were you excused? 
MR TSOTSI:   They said to me that the board wants to 
discuss me and for that reason they would prefer that I not 
be present when they discuss me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember who in the board said 
that?  Among the board members, do you remember who 
came up with that or do you not remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I honestly do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The probability – oh, wait a minute, wait a 
20 
minute, this was also every interesting.  Now that I see 
that Mr Kumalo joined the meeting.  Chairman, there was 
something very strange about the way this thing went 
about.  We were sitting in this meeting having this meeting, 
as indicated here, and the Romeo Kumalo walked into the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 131 of 220 
 
meeting.   
The moment he walked into the meeting I was then 
asked to excuse myself because he came from somewhere, 
I do not know where he came from, it is as though he came 
and brought some message because he shared a private 
conversation with one or two of the board members and I 
seems to recall it was Dr Ngubane, maybe he can tell us if 
that was him but I seem to think that he did share 
something.   
But 
what 
I 
do 
specifically 
remember, 
I 
even 
10 
commented about this afterwards, that Romeo Kumalo 
seems to have brought something which triggered this 
reaction from them to say right, Chairman, we would like 
you to excuse us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, but you do not know what it 
is, a message or whatever? 
MR TSOTSI:   I have no idea, Chairman, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but your being asked to leave the 
meeting happened soon after Mr Romeo Kumalo had come 
in? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and had come in and talked to one or 
two members of the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Until that point what was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 132 of 220 
 
your assessment of the board towards you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I did feel that there was no sense 
of comfort from the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   There was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was some uneasiness. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, we focused on this because I 
10 
asked you certain questions, you were just telling the story 
about your removal or resignation.  You were highlighting 
what you wanted to highlight. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Chair, if you pardon me, there is 
something also very important which I forget to mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   In relation to all of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
What 
happened 
the 
day 
after 
the 
suspensions were effected, I then went and had a press 
20 
conference 
where 
I 
announced 
this 
to 
South 
Africa 
basically.  By middle of the day – and this press 
conference was something in the morning, maybe around 
nine, ten o’clock in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that would have been the 11 t h or the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 133 of 220 
 
12 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was on the 12 March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was on the 12 March. 
MR TSOTSI:   I think so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The press conference, Mr Nick Linnell 
talks about in his affidavit.  According to him it was after 
your – the suspensions took place. 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
The 
following 
morning 
because 
the 
suspensions finished at about midnight or something like 
that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, so again, Mr Dan Marokane, 
which is one of the suspended executives I think confirms 
that position. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because he was suspended the next 
day. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the press conference came 
after his suspension. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the announcement of the suspension 
of the executives happened after you yourself had been 
suspended? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, no.  No, he is back to the 11 t h and 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 134 of 220 
 
12 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I am back to the 11 t h now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, because the decision to 
suspend the executives was taken on the 11 t h. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
the 
announcement 
of 
those 
suspension to the public, did it take place on the 11 t h or on 
the 12 t h or whatever other day? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was on the 12 t h.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It happened on the 12 t h.   
MR TSOTSI:   It was my son’s birthday that day, I 
remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   It was on the 12 t h, Chair, during the morning 
hours and the issue that I wanted to highlight on that day 
was that something – let me put it this way, the event that 
happened after that, you know, turned out that that was 
probably the worst day I had at Eskom, as an Eskom 
Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What happened? 
MR TSOTSI:   I was informed by the head of Treasury at 
Eskom that there was a series of phone calls that I was to 
entertain from our investors.  It turns out  there were some 
52 
investors 
who 
had 
organised, 
you 
know, 
a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 135 of 220 
 
teleconference, anything from Hawai to Japan.  I mean, 
that is right across the globe, who wanted to find out what 
is going on.   
 
And 
the 
focus 
of 
their 
interest 
was 
what 
is 
happening with the financial director in the company?  The 
financial director is the only executive that is mentioned in 
the main by the people by these investors and they were 
all asking the same question, what is going on, what is the 
problem?   
 
And, Chair, as I said in my submission at the 
10 
parliamentary 
portfolio 
committee, 
I 
felt 
like 
it 
was 
defending the indefensible.  That is how I felt, I was 
completely drained at the end of that experience because 
in all conscience I could not really say that there is 
plausible reason for us to have done what we have done. 
 
So that was the first real feeling of betrayal coming 
out of that notwithstanding the fact that I had been part of 
the process myself but, you know, I had to deal with these 
things on my own and so when that passed, you know, the 
feeling settled quite well that I am now in a very 
20 
uncomfortable position and anything could happen. 
 
So when the 19 t h happened, you know, it was as 
though it was in the making because of the events that had 
been taking place prior to that, some of which I have 
already mentioned. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 136 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now on the 12 t h, when you addressed 
the press conference, did you address it on your own 
without any of the board members?  
MR TSOTSI:   No, the board members were present.  There 
was a – I think -  it does say, I think in one of the 
documents, which board members were asked to attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so but you were not alone? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I was not alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did they participate in terms of 
dealing with questions of you dealt with all the questions 
yourself and they were just there I guess to support? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, it was the only thing that happened, 
they were just there to support. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   They did not say anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Now – so you dealt with these 
queries and questions from investors all over the world but 
you felt that you were defending the indefensible? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When you had to deal with those 
investors, I guess the board members were not there, 
these were just phone calls that you were answering. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I was all alone. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 137 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Why did you feel you were on 
your own when you were answering those questions from 
the investors?  Was it simply because you were feeling that 
you were defending the indefensible but you thought that 
everybody else in the board thought this was defensible or 
what was the situation?   Why did you feel you were on 
your own? 
MR TSOTSI:   I felt I was on my own, Chairman, because I 
did not believe that any of the board members would be 
able to substantiate the action in any credible way at all.  
10 
Apart from the fact that it would look very strange to some 
investors talking to someone who has been in a business 
for a month and a half, two months, three months, who 
would be expected to have the requisite understanding of, 
you know, Eskom’s relationship with its investors. 
 
As you are aware, we discussed in one of those 
board meetings the road shows and so on, so those kinds 
of questions they would not have been able to deal with in 
terms 
of 
the 
expectation 
of 
our 
investors 
in 
the 
circumstances where things like this are happening.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the investors who called 
focused simply on the financial director, their questions 
related to the financial director and what is happening at 
Eskom 
but 
they 
were 
not 
asking 
about 
the 
other 
executives? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 138 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, they were not – they did mention that 
they 
are 
hearing 
that 
some 
executives 
have 
been 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Some did also question the suspension of 
the Chief Executive, I must confess, but the majority of 
them had a concern about, you know, the custodianship of 
the investment.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Through the - you know the management of 
10 
the FD.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So that was really their focus. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Given that it had been said and you said 
that the suspension of the executives was not based on 
any accusation of wrongdoing on their part.  Why does it 
seem like it was more difficult to defend the suspension of 
the financial director than it was to defend the decision to 
suspend the other executives because all of them were not 
said to have – the suspensions were not based on any 
20 
allegations of wrongdoing?  
MR TSOTSI:   I think, Chair, is because the perception is 
that if the custodianship of the finances of the because has 
in a way being placed in jeopardy from their perspective 
then they should be worried about this company’s capacity 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 139 of 220 
 
to protect their investments because Eskom has got loans 
and they have been money into the Eskom bonds, etcetera.  
So I understand pretty well why they were concerned about 
focusing 
their 
thinking 
and 
their 
expression 
on 
the     
financial side of the business, you know, through the 
enquiries they were making about the financial director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of conduct, would you agree 
that there may have been no basis to distinguish between 
the 
FD 
and 
the 
other 
executives 
because 
their 
suspensions, all of them, was based on saying there is no 
10 
allegation of wrongdoing? 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, there is certainly no differentiation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the only difference with regard to 
the financial director may simple be that certainly in the 
eyes of the investors her role may have been seen as quite 
critical for their purposes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja 
the 
basis 
of 
defending 
her 
20 
suspension would be the same as the basis for defending 
the others, namely we are not saying that the FD has 
committed any misconduct. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   All we are doing is there is going to be 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 140 of 220 
 
an investigation and we think that it would be better if the 
FD and the other executives are not there when the 
investigations happen so that employees feel freer to say 
whatever they might wish to say to the investigators.  That 
is the same story with everybody, is it not? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that it is not like there is a 
separate explanation for her, her suspension, different 
from the explanation for the suspension of the other 
executives. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  If you had not finished 
what you wanted to highlight you can continue and finalise. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, let me just wrap up here, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   As I said, the team that went to Cape Town 
to meet the Minister, and of course I was excluded from 
that meeting as well.  I think it was a Friday the day they 
went.   
And the following week, sometime in the middle of 
20 
the week I then received an invitation to appear before the 
board to answer to these charges and I went to hear and 
obviously I organised my legal support and we were given 
a very tight timeline within which to respond and we 
requested 
a 
postponement 
and 
we 
requested 
a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 141 of 220 
 
postponement and eventually we then had the this meeting 
on the 30 March. 
 
Now this meeting I think is in the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   There should be some record of it, it is in 
the bundle… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 683. 
MR TSOTSI:   683. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is 30 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Chair, this meeting then was 
constituted by the board, including myself, and then the 
board had its legal advisers and I also brought in my own 
legal advisers and the substance of it really is that the 
board then asked that there are the charges that have 
been given and how do I plead in terms of those charges? 
 
I then went on to deal with them – obviously we had 
prepared in advance with my team and I went on to defend 
myself and at the end of my presentation there were one or 
20 
two interventions by my lawyers and their lawyers on their 
side and then following that I was asked to recuse myself, 
which I did, and in essence I was pleading my innocence 
and that I – there is no reason for me to be pursued in this 
manner because the essential charges was that I am not fit 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 142 of 220 
 
to be a director.  Yes.   Now after a while the board 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the factual basis for that allegations 
that you are not fit to be a director, being what? 
MR TSOTSI:   The four charges that we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The four charges that we have looked 
at? 
MR TSOTSI:   That will be – yes, that is right.  So at the 
end at some point in the evening the board sent a 
delegation to come and talk to me consisting of Dr 
10 
Ngubane and Romeo Kumalo.  And they then made a 
proposition to me that  if I agree to resign, they would then 
drop the charges against me because they did not want 
there to be a long messy engagement between us. 
 
Now in the interim I had been assured by my 
counsel that the basis upon which these charges were 
founded is quite flimsy and in essence they were easily 
dismissible before a court of law but I had reasoned in my 
own mind that this sort of thing can impugn the reputation 
of the business, not least of all mine, and so I thought it is 
20 
in the best interest – my best interest and that of the 
company to step out, accept the offer of resignation and 
then, you know, move away from the company. 
 
So what then happened was, I said fine, I will 
accept but we need to go back to the board so I can tell 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 143 of 220 
 
the board my response.  So I went into the board meeting 
and of course I told them in some respects something of an 
earful in terms of what I thought they were doing and at the 
end of it all I made my request to the board about certain 
issues pertaining to me personally which were, first of all, 
that my belief is that I am entitled to my legal defence by 
the company to which the board readily agreed. 
 
And secondly that I was left with three months or so 
of my term for the first year because my contract was such 
that it was a three year contract renewable every year.  So 
10 
there was about three months left before expiry of the first 
year and I asked that I should be compensated for balance 
of the time left.  The board responded to say they thought 
they could do – that they agree to that but that matter is in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
Minister 
because 
the 
Minister 
is 
responsible for the remuneration of directors. 
 
And then the third aspect, I think had to do with my 
request to retain my tablet, I think, and my phone at my 
own cost.  So that the board granted me as well. 
 
Then I of course requested time to clear my office, 
20 
which time I was given.   
 
Then, Chairman, what happened shortly thereafter – 
of course the media was all over the place and we are 
talking about 1 a.m. I think by the time we got out of the 
building but certainly the next day I was inundated by 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 144 of 220 
 
media.  There was a particular interview that I had, I think 
it was a day after, where I was asked a very specific 
question and the question had to do with what do I think, 
how it is that I was in the situation that I was in?  And 
specifically, has the Minister anything to do with it?  I 
responded in the affirmative to say I believe that the 
Minister has something to do with my removal or had a 
hand in it. 
 
Shortly thereafter, I think about two days thereafter, 
I was informed by Dr Ngubane that the Minister objected 
10 
strenuously to the statement I made in the media and if I 
do not retract that statement I will not receive any 
remuneration and sure enough, almost a week later, I 
received a letter from the Minister turning down my request 
for the balance of my term.  
 
That, Chairman, is the essence, the substance of 
what happened up to the time I literally stepped out of the 
company.   
But one unfortunate fallout also is the fact that 
despite numerous attempts to collect my legal fees from 
20 
Eskom, Eskom has consistently denied paying my legal 
fees and up to now my fees have not been paid.  So that is 
the essence of what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well – no, thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  It 
seems the method seems not dissimilar to some of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 145 of 220 
 
methods I have heard evidence about where people, 
officials in either state owned entities or in government 
departments or organs of state who were perceived as 
people who would not cooperate with those who wanted to 
do wrong would be put on suspension, they would be told 
that they would face a disciplinary hearing, that it would 
take long before any charges were put together or 
sometimes they were not put together and the people were 
then offered settlements to go away.   
It happened to Dr Dower(2) at SAA.  There has 
10 
been evidence about how Mr Nxasana, who used to be 
National Director of Public Prosecutions was removed.  His 
settlement agreement with the government said he is fit to 
be employed in any senior position, if I recall correctly, but 
he was removed.   
There may be something similar with regard Mr Vusi 
Pikoli but you also have – there was Ms Mpshe at SAA as 
well.  There was a CEO at Denel who was put through quite 
a process and ultimately had to leave.   
There is a big number of people who were treated 
20 
like that about whom I have been given evidence.  Of 
course, it also seems that what happened to you is also 
not very different from what happened to Mr Matona. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You get suspended and before there 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 146 of 220 
 
could be a full ventilation of what the issues are, then 
there is discussion of a settlement.  And he gave evidence, 
I believe you were here, to say in the negotiations those 
who represented the board said going back to your job is 
out of the question and he was given 12 months’ salary. 
 
So it is very worrying.  Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
just to emphasise the point the Chairperson is making with 
you is that when you look at these charges against the 
backdrop of the decisions that are taken on 11 March 2015 
10 
meeting, the video recordings of which we have played 
parts of it where we hear that one of the board members 
saying Mr Nick, we are contracting with you and not ENS.   
 
And you look at subsequent engagements made 
with him, Mr Nick Linnell, you have seen in his affidavit he 
says he receives the invitation to attend some of the 
subcommittee 
meetings 
exactly 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
assisting the P & G committee, People in Governance, and 
the Audit and Risk committee and there is also the board 
programme workshop he refers to, all that emanating from 
20 
the board itself.  It puzzles one to thereafter – this is 
happening of the 11 t h and there is further engagement with 
him on the 12 t h, on the 13 t h and so on. 
 
So on the 19 t h you have a meeting eight days later, 
maybe even shorter because Mr Linnell said the email that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 147 of 220 
 
cancels his invitation was only received on the 17 t h.   
You get a board that resolves to charge you for 
engaging Mr Linnell.  You get a board that resolves to 
charge you for allegedly Mr Linnell starting to work without 
board approval.  That is charge 2. 
And I was asking you how do you deal with those 
charges but I think you have now provided an answer 
during your explanation to the Chairperson that your 
lawyers said these charges will be dismissible, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was going on in your mind, if you 
could just give me a picture, as you were sitting there 
defending yourself to a board that, as far as you knew, had 
endorsed all of these things with you about Mr Linnell, that 
board turning on you and charging you with contracting Mr 
Linnell 
without 
following 
procedures 
or 
without 
them 
getting involved.  What was going on?  What were you 
thinking was happening?  Could you believe what you were 
seeing? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I certainly was, with possible 
description, flabbergasted.  I was - you know, one of the 
questions I asked the board members, I asked them if 
having appreciation of the gravity of the situation, not only 
that they placed me in, but they are placing the company in 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 148 of 220 
 
and I said – and this is occurring at the time when literally 
only one of you has any knowledge of this company’s 
business.  The rest of the board did not have the 
knowledge of the company’s business and I said you then 
have the temerity to take action of this nature.  I think 
there is something that is seriously wrong with the thinking 
that has taken you to where we are now.  You have not 
applied your minds to what you have now placed the 
company in.  And so I do not think that you merit to be 
where you are. 
10 
 
So I think hopefully they had time to reflect on what 
I had to say and probably did some introspection to 
understand at the end of the day the gravity of what they 
had done.  So I hoped that that would happen.  
 
And on a somewhat lighter note, Chairman, in a 
grave situation, I said to them that one of the things I 
learnt when I was living in the United States is an old 
expression that I learnt from my American friends which 
goes, what goes around comes around.  And when I think 
of what has happened since I left Eskom, I reflect and say 
20 
indeed, what goes around does come around because if 
you look at what has happened to the very people who 
were orchestrating my departure from Eskom, what has 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Also, I have never heard of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 149 of 220 
 
Chairperson of a board being charged by the board and all 
of that, I had never heard of anything like that before I 
heard about your being charged. 
 
You have sat in many boards, is that something that 
does happen reasonably….  
MR TSOTSI:   I have never encountered it, Chair, it is the 
first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did they have power to bring 
charges against you, do you know?  Could they bring 
charges against or if they did not have confidence in you, 
10 
they just needed to vote and say they have no confidence 
in you, that is all or is that something you do not know? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have to consult my legal adviser, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is something you never applied 
your mind to. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  And then charge 3 
deals with some media statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You know, part of the reason 
why I ask is because they did not appoint you to the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
They 
did 
not 
appoint 
you 
as 
Chairperson. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 150 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I wonder where they would get the 
power to dismiss something they did not appoint.  Maybe 
they do but I am saying that is part of the reason why I was 
asking. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  There is – the 
matter is taken further in charge 3: 
“The director authorised a commissioning of a 
media statement in relation to an inquiry into the 
10 
affairs of the company with the assistance of the 
consultant without the knowledge and the consent 
of the board.” 
But, Mr Tsotsi, you have gone through the transcripts.  
There is a point there where Mr Linnell says, I have 
prepared a draft and they are all excited, want to see the 
draft he has prepared and one of the board members in 
fact goes further to say Mr Linnell should work with – I 
think they say Mr Mark Pamensky or is it Dr Naidoo – on 
the draft.  Do you recall that? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I will get that portion for the 
benefit of the Chairperson.  And then the remaining 
charges deal with the integrity of the company and that you 
have failed to meet the minimum requirements of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 151 of 220 
 
standard of care expected of yourself.  
 
Now it seems to me that if the board was accusing 
you of all these aspects, pointing a finger at you, the other 
fingers were pointing at the board itself.   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That means the board itself would have 
had to similarly step aside for the very reasons that they 
were charging you with. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And not a single person, not a single 
10 
member of this board stood up at any time and faced the 
rest of the board members and say you people, what are 
you talking about?  We all agreed to this.  Not a single 
person said that when you were being charged with these 
charges or was there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I understood later on that the 
board had an issue with Norman Baloyi and Norman 
actually left the board.  I think he was also dealt with by 
the board and he had to leave and he was questioning the 
actions of the board.  There have been times when Mr 
20 
Baloyi has made – remember when I made the example of 
those people who were - at least the spectrum I spoke of, 
on the liberal said where people are saying we are rushing 
into this thing, let us think about it, we might get into a 
situation that we would regret we have gotten into as 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 152 of 220 
 
against those who wanted things to get done and get done 
immediately.  Now Norman Baloyi was the one person who 
raised flags continuously and he was very much ignored.  
 
So I heard – I think the people who will come to 
testify should be able to say because I was not in the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at no stage during the time that you 
were at the meeting with the board either responding to the 
charges or being told the charges, at no stage did 
somebody did say in your presence I want my position to 
10 
be clear that I do not go along with this because we all 
went along with this together as a board.  Nobody said that 
in your presence. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV

CHAIRPERSON:   Well, 799 which you told us about earlier 
does have – or does seem to me to have part of what we 
hear. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where it says: 
10 
“Capture all that.  Did you capture all that?” 
I thought that is what they are saying.

statements.   I would imagine this can have such a 
positive effect on the public that you would find 
10 
your 
Minister 
and 
the 
President 
will 
make 
a 
statement to this effect.   Now we all know he is 
talking in Parliament today and so if your Minister 
has told him about it he might also make a 
statement in Parliament today.  Who knows, but you 
have to anticipate that your announcement might 
not be the first announcement because if the 
Minister sprang up and said, President, we’re doing 
this he’s going to – politically, he should tell the 
public, he’s the leader of the country, he should 
20 
stand up and say, guys the Board is doing this and I 
support it.” 
Okay now, I think I would obviously have to call the 
Minister and tell her about the outcome of this, of 
the meeting, right and I would also indicate to her 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264

that…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your voice Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you confirm Mr Tsotsi, that’s your 
voice. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, continue. 
AUDIO PLAYED: 
“We intend to send …[indistinct 1.03.40] statement 
tonight just about the decision of the Board to do 
10 
this fact-finding inquiry, just so she knows that is 
coming out in the media. Now she may have 
whatever responses she has but, certainly it’s 
…[intervenes]. 
 
It’s good protocol. 
 
She may want us to have that emailed to her. 
Ja, listen to this Chairman, Board”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who’s voice is that Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  It’s Pat Naidoo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
20 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
“In its pursuit to, can I say it, Board of pursuit in its 
pursuit of making Eskom world-class, something 
like 
that 
has 
resolved 
the 
Commission 
an 
independent fact gathering exercise on the health 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 160 of 220 
 
and condition of Eskom.  To this end the Board has 
requested four of the top Executives of the company 
to be relieved of their duties during the period of 
the fact gathering exercise. 
I wouldn’t do that, that’s premature.  I think 
...[intervenes]  
We still need to have that meeting with them. 
Ja, I think adjectives like world-class organisation 
are superlatives which are not necessary because 
you are business people, that’s marketing tool – I 
10 
agree what you want to do is say, we, as a Board 
have taken a decision to do this.  The reason is, we 
want to better understand the status – the condition 
of 
our 
capacity 
and 
capability 
and 
make 
adjustments as are necessary in the circumstances 
and 
then 
reassure 
the 
public 
that 
there’s 
no 
immediate risk that you’re concerned about that, 
they haven’t been previously told about.  So it’s a 
positive 
statement 
with 
countering 
negative 
…[indistinct]. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, please confirm, whose voice 
is that? 
MR TSOTSI:   That was Nick Linnell, who is the last one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, members of the Board are 
engaging with him? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 161 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On what I gather he is formulating a 
wording for a media statement that Eskom will release after 
they’ve suspended Executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   Exactly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Continue. 
AUDIO PLAYED:  
“You’re going to have to put something together. 
To capture all that. 
Did you capture all that? 
10 
 
But you can work with Nick. 
Ja.   
And Andrew …[indistinct 1.06.07] where does he fit 
in here? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s just go back, there was a female 
voice at 1.58.11. 
AUDIO PLAYED:   
 
“But you can work with Nick”.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Isn’t that – just stop there, whose 
voice is that, Mr Tsotsi, we hear but you can work with 
20 
Nick. 
MR TSOTSI:   You can work with Nick, that’s Ms Naidoo or 
Venita, I can’t tell it was too short. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was either Ms Naidoo or Ms Venita 
Klein.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 162 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Continue. 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
“And Andrew…[indistinct 1.07.02] where does he fit 
in here”. 
MR TSOTSI:   That was Twaita [?]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Mabude? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Mabude yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
10 
 
“Let me just get my…[intervenes]. 
 
I did draft something. 
 
Did you draft something? 
 
Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Pause there.  That is Mr ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:  I did draft something, that was Nick Linnell, 
did you draft something, that was me asking him, Nick 
came back and said yes, then I said, so let us have a listen 
then. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So then, that’s charge 3, 
20 
charge 3, 
“The Director authorised a commission with a media 
statement in relation to an inquiry into the affairs of 
the company with the assistance of the consultant, 
without the knowledge and/or consent of the Board”. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 163 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he’s there, he’s saying to them, I 
did draft something and they further engaged with him on 
that.   You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi the audios that we have been 
hearing here are of what was being said in a Board 
meeting, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Board members are taking part in 
10 
discussions about what should go into a media statement 
that is going to be sent out or read out, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is happening in a Board 
meeting?   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are there, they are there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But later they charge you with saying, 
you authorised a media statement without their knowledge. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s right Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How does that happen? 
MR TSOTSI:   I – it beats me, I – that’s why I said I 
was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was going on, really here? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 164 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman there was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because people have been appointed to 
be a Board of a very important state-owned entity but on 
the face of it, what one is hearing here, is just something 
unbelievable. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe somebody – one of them or 
more will explain and maybe we don’t understand now 
because they’ve not explained, maybe when they explain, 
we will understand. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Let’s listen on 
further Mr Tsotsi, just a little bit more. 
AUDIO PLAYED: 
“But again, it’s your decision, I mean, I just – 
because obviously I’ve been thinking about.” 
Ja, you all need to go ahead and do that. 
They’re going to leave the offices. 
Can I just test an understanding…” 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s the first time you hear the voice of 
Zetembe Xhosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and what is he saying? 
MR TSOTSI:   He’s saying we are delaying the process in 
telling the people that they are gone, they are going to go, 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 165 of 220 
 
presumably talking about the Executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Executives yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   The executives and they’re going to leave 
the offices. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, thank you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh no, my mistake, he’s referring to people 
who 
would 
be 
receiving 
this 
information 
in 
the 
organisation, he wanted …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Executives, is he referring to the 
Executives? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  I think he is referring to the staff at Eskom, I 
think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which staff? 
MR TSOTSI:   That the organisation should know that – 
this intent to carry out the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So, the media statement, the idea was, it 
should go out before the staff leave the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   I think that’s what he’s talking about here, I 
20 
think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I got the impression – maybe wrongly, 
that the discussion is the Executives who are to be 
suspended should get the information as soon as possible 
because they are going to go, but I may have completely 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 166 of 220 
 
misunderstood. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was my impression as well Chair. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well Mr Tsotsi you were there, you 
would know better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he would know better. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please continue. 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
“Would you – as I understand it, I might not be right 
but”…[intervenes]. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you please just go to where he 
starts, Mr Linnell, I believe that’s him, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page are we going to be on 
now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It’s page 801 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the top of 801. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
20 
“…table decision to do this, the reason is, we want 
to better understand the status of the – the 
condition of our capacity and capability and make 
adjustments …[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no stop there, no that’s way back. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 167 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   799. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are on the wrong place.  Okay, 
start at 158.39. 
AUDIO PLAYED:    
“…Ja you all need to go ahead and do that. 
They’re going to leave the offices. 
Ja, Can I just test an understanding with you?  As I 
understand it, I might not be right, but did the 
Minister inform any of the individuals that they 
could, well be, suspended. 
10 
No, the Minister is not involved. 
The Minister is not involved. 
This is a Board…[intervenes]. 
This is a Board discussion. 
Okay”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Stop there.  
MR TSOTSI:   Okay so, these various members of the 
Board was making the statement that, in response to the 
question by Nick Linnell as to whether the Minister has 
informed 
any 
of 
the 
individuals 
that 
could 
well 
be 
20 
suspended, and all of them were saying no the Minister is 
not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they don’t – I don’t understand that 
the Minister wouldn’t be the person to tell the Executives, 
you are suspended. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 168 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, Chair, I think the idea here, if I 
understand it, is that the decision to suspend is made by 
the Board so it’s the Board’s responsibility to inform the 
Executives that they are suspended.  I think that’s what 
Nick was referring to here, I presume, as against informing 
the Minister about the suspension of the Executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I thought that Mr Linnell was 
asking whether the Minister had informed the Executives 
who were going to be suspended, that, that was his 
question. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s right yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then somebody says, no the 
Minister is not involved another one says, no our Minister 
is not involved and then another, the one says, this is a 
Board decision.  So I’m just saying, maybe it goes back to 
the point you made yesterday and today, that this Board 
hasn’t even begun to understand the business of Eskom 
and to – they don’t know the Executives that they are 
making decisions about but somebody, one or more of them 
seems to – or maybe that was Mr Linnell, maybe I’m being 
20 
unfair to them.  Mr Linnell might have thought that the 
Minister would be the one to tell the Executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the Board members, okay ja, maybe 
I was being unfair to them, okay. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 169 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, he makes his point 
clearer later on, Mr Linnell himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let’s listen on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it might answer the very 
question you have in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, because – let me explain it after 
that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
AUDIO PLAYED:   
“...but did the Minister inform any of the individuals 
that they could well be suspended? 
No, the Minister is not involved. 
Our Minister is not involved. 
This is a Board discussion. 
This is a Board discussion. 
Okay”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So – pause there.  You see the answer 
20 
to that question, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It’s not an answer to that question, it’s 
a response to the question but it’s not an answer to the 
question.  The question is whether, did the Minister inform 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 170 of 220 
 
any of the Executives whether they could be suspended. 
MR TSOTSI:   Right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Board members answer, they say, 
no this is a Board decision. 
MR TSOTSI:   I suppose – well sitting in the meeting and 
listening to Nick saying what he said, Chair, it says to me 
that the suspension of Executives, probably should be 
announced or the said Executives should be informed by 
the Minister as against the Board, that’s how I interpreted 
what Nick was saying.  So, what the Board members are 
10 
responding to is that, no, it is the responsibility of the 
Board to do that and not of the Minister, that is why they 
are saying the Minister is not involved …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it is a Board decision. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it is a Board decision. So, the idea of 
communicating the suspensions to the Executives should 
not involve the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me put a different proposition to 
you, because you’ll see what Mr Linnell says thereafter.  
Mr Linnell seems to suggest that one of the Executives has 
20 
prior knowledge that they are going to be suspended.  
Could that be what Mr Linnell is saying? Just read further 
what his response …[intervenes]. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I see that yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, just read it. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 171 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   He says, 
“Okay, it might not be so, in which case they 
already know”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In other words, so they could have 
been informed by the Minister.  So he’s not asking a 
question of authority to make the decision, he’s asking 
whether there is prior communication, which then makes 
one of the Executives to have prior knowledge of the 
decision before it is made, that’s exactly his point. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, I see.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what – the impression one – it’s not 
even an impression, because what you see from the 
deliberations or discussions in this meeting, and you see 
that right at the beginning – and I hope the technician will 
help me, very quickly, I’m going to refer you to the second 
of the audio recordings, time stamp 22.45, Chairperson I’ll 
give you the page reference number, I think it’s page 879. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   879. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it’s a long piece Chairperson, 
let’s start on page 880, time stamp 22.47, and 245 
AUDIO PLAYED: 
“...the right way. 
Correct, I agree. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 172 of 220 
 
...[indistinct] I want to compare Mr ...” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whose voice is that Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s Gwaita Mabuda. 
ADV SELEKA:   Thank you. 
AUDIO PLAYED 
“We are in South Africa in case we ...[indistinct] 
forgotten.  We are in South Africa and the problem 
in South Africa is that most things are discussed on 
these and I don’t want us to leave this meeting 
forgetting 
that 
in 
as 
much 
as 
we 
have 
the 
10 
responsibility to take care of Eskom we have a 
responsibility to protect our leaders.  The point that 
we have said here ...[indistinct] here to say means I 
must be excused on ...[indistinct] that we talked 
together about.  It is something that we need to 
take very seriously.  The mention of the President in 
these ...[indistinct] is something that we need to 
know that it is wrong.  If it is mentioned to 
emphasize something we must not, even one person 
must leave with the ...[indistinct] because we know 
20 
...[indistinct] and for him to or for us to open an 
attack as well at our level that could be – that 
would result in him being attacked further than he is 
now is not right, and for us to as ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 173 of 220 
 
Of its process. 
...[Indistinct] the Minister might have given us 
guidance but she cannot own this business, we 
need to own it and the mention that ...” 
ADV SELEKA SC   Do you see that Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We can’t hear her properly, but you 
could read ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to raise your voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  We can’t hear 
10 
her properly on the audio but the transcription could assist 
us and if you could read that last part.  There is a part 
where she says we must protect our leaders, did you see 
that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes I saw that. 
ADV SELEKA:   The next page, can you start from there.   
MR TSOTSI:   It says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that on 879 ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   880. 
CHAIRPERSON:   880 okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA:   Thank you Chair, thank you Mr Tsotsi.    
MR TSOTSI:   It says – she says herein as much as we 
have responsibility to take – I don’t know what this is – we 
have a responsibility to protect our leaders, the point that 
we had said here was when the Minister was here to say 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 174 of 220 
 
the Minister must be excused on some of the decisions that 
we need to report to her about it is a good – it is 
something that we need to take very seriously.  The 
mention of the President in this boardroom is something 
that we need to know that it is wrong, it is – if it is 
mentioned to emphasize something we must not, not even 
one person must leave with the word President because we 
know the attack against government through our President 
and for him and for us to open an attack as well at our 
level that will result in him being attacked further than he 
10 
is now.   It is not right and for us to, as the doctor says we 
need to take ownership of this process.  He might have 
been shady, the Minister might have given us guidance but 
she cannot own this process.  We need to own it and 
remember that the newspaper is going to outline that she 
arrived after this inspired her.  So it means therefore that 
we can’t – we need to defend we need to always make sure 
that we prevent our leaders and we fail to do that, we have 
failed Eskom as well, and we have failed the country if we 
are part of people that are sabotaging effectively our 
20 
leaders we have failed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Mr Tsotsi.  Right, you may – 
well you could explain to the Chairperson the context in 
which that statement was made. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 175 of 220 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because we understand from you that 
you had met with the President. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We understand from your evidence but 
you had told about the President is the one who asked you 
to test the proposal. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  Chair the – this sentiment came 
through in the meeting of the 9 t h, the very first time we 
dealt with this matter to the extent that there was it is said 
as a set of minutes that mentions the President and there 
10 
is 
another 
set 
of 
minutes 
that 
doesn’t 
mention 
the 
President, because some members felt that we shouldn’t 
invoke the name of the President in our discussions or 
minutes so this sentiment is once again coming across 
when the deliberation as we had said earlier, remember 
earlier when Nick made the suggestion that if we don’t 
move quickly we might find that the President may want to 
put out a statement about what is happening at Eskom, so 
there is a certain or there was a certain reluctance on the 
part of one or two of the board members to mention the 
20 
name of the President and they were very uncomfortable 
when I specifically spoke about the fact that I had been 
summoned to the President’s residence and had a meeting 
with him, there was some level of discomfort about that, so 
this is reflective of the same sort of discomfort once the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 176 of 220 
 
President’s name is mentioned in a board meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we see there too also that Ms 
Mabude says the Minister might have given us guidance 
but we must own this process.  Right, what was that 
guidance? 
MR TSOTSI:   When the Minister came to speak of course 
the Minister declared her position regarding not only the 
inquiry itself but the suspensions and as I said earlier so I 
am presuming that she is referring to the fact that the 
Minister gave her support to the Board for the carrying out 
10 
of the inquiry and as well as effecting the suspensions, so 
I am presuming that she is referring to that aspect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it appears to be a clear 
acquiescence by the Board in a proposal made from 
outside of the Board to initiate an inquiry and suspend 
executives.   Is that a fair assessment of what is 
happening? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As I said to you yesterday the Board is 
succeeding, and I will say this time around not a demand, 
20 
but a request/proposal which originates outside of the 
board. 
MR TSOTSI:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it is taking a conscious decision to 
own this process. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 177 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It may have originated outside but they 
are deciding let’s own it to protect our leaders.  Correct, is 
that a fair assessment? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is a fair assessment yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And so your charges must be 
understood in the context of this meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we can’t divorce your charges from 
this meeting, is that correct? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes absolutely.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chairperson I have got one 
last question, Mr Tsotsi you – the issue of Sumitomo came 
up yesterday and you talked about it in the context of Mr 
Koko. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In his statement to the Parliamentary 
Portfolio Committee and in his affidavit to this Commission 
he outlines that aspect in regard to the suspension of Mr 
Malesela, what’s the surname, help me with the surname 
20 
again? 
MR TSOTSI:   Sekhasimbe. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sekhasimbe, that he had been 
suspended and you wanted that suspension to be reversed.  
You, according to him, sends Mr Matona to him to reverse 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 178 of 220 
 
the suspension otherwise he says, him and Mr Matona 
would be suspended and according to him he says their 
suspension on the 11 t h of March 2015, he believes, was 
orchestrated by you in relation to that aspect of his refusal 
to 
un-suspend, 
the 
word 
he’s 
used, 
Mr 
Malesela 
Sekhasimbe, you response to that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, what…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, what I would like you to tell the 
Chairperson, is whether the underlying reason for the 
suspension of Mr Koko and Mr Matona had to do with the 
10 
failure by him to reverse or withdraw the suspension of Mr 
Malesela Sekhasimbe? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair, that is incorrect, that is without a 
doubt, incorrect.  Mr Malesela, when I saw his affidavit, 
speaks of this incident as having occurred on the 8 t h – 
Sunday the 8 t h, the same day I was at the Presidency and 
that I asked Mr Matona to instruct him to un-suspend this 
gentleman that he had suspended in his division.  No, I 
was here when Mr Matona was giving his evidence, he 
clearly indicated – and sorry before I get there, to say then 
20 
if I don’t – if he does not suspend this gentleman in his 
division then – or un-suspend him I’m sorry, if he does not 
un-suspend him, I will then suspend Mr Matona and 
himself, hence, that is the reason why he has been 
suspended.  So, I’m saying that, because he claims that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 179 of 220 
 
this communication with Mr Matona took place on Sunday, 
for me that leaves much to be desired because, Mr Matona, 
when he was here clearly made a statement to the effect 
that the first time he encountered this idea of suspension 
was on the afternoon when he was called by the Committee 
to be addressed on the issue of suspension.  I would have 
expected Mr Matona, if that were the case, to have 
indicated clearly that he’d heard of the suspensions of 
himself and he heard about it as early as Sunday when I, 
purportedly phoned him.  So, I reject what Mr Malesela is 
10 
saying, he is a good Engineer Chairman but he has a great 
imagination as well, which two things don’t seem to go 
together.  So, I think – I certainly do not agree with this 
statement.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson, that wraps my 
questions to Mr Tsotsi, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Tsotsi, if, later 
on, because the Commission’s investigations continue, if 
later on there is something we wish you to come in to 
clarify, we will ask you to please come back but we will try 
20 
and make sure that we don’t ask you to come back unless 
it’s really necessary.  Your legal representative may be 
wishing to re-examine you, I’m going to ask him whether he 
wishes to do so, would you like to re-examine or you have 
no re-examination? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 180 of 220 
 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you Chairperson, I will have 
re-examination.  During the lunch break, I engaged my 
colleague, Mr Seleka and intimated to him that perhaps 
you’ll give guidance whether you wish us to do that now or 
you have other witnesses and we can deal with it in the 
morning? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have an idea of how long you 
might be with – if you were to re-examine now? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   I’d imagine about half an hour, 
maximum 45 minutes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   About half an hour, what is the time 
now? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   I’m mindful of the timeframes of 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well before we start with another 
witness it would be better to finish with Mr Tsotsi, it may be 
that – I see it’s twenty past four, it may be that we should 
take a short adjournment.  The witnesses who were 
supposed to have testified today, let’s talk about that, how 
long would the next witness be, you think Mr Seleka, do 
20 
you have an idea? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson they said one Judge said 
any estimation of time that a legal practitioner give you 
multiply it by two.  Let me try to give the Chairperson an 
answer during the adjournment. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 181 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you know what I am thinking is that 
next week I think there is room for hearing some witnesses 
next week, now it may well be that if some of the days next 
week are available and all concerned are available it may 
well be that we have to 
choose whether 
we move 
everybody by one day so those who were to testify today 
testify tomorrow, those who were to testify tomorrow testify 
on Friday and then we find a day next week when we can 
complete or whether we take today’s witnesses and put 
them next week on one of the days and then tomorrow 
10 
continue with the witnesses who were going to give 
evidence tomorrow and Friday, so maybe if we take this 
adjournment you can apply your mind to that as well as 
discuss with whoever you might be able to discuss with, 
who may be affected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With that arrangement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that might affect how far we go 
today but I think we should if possible try and get Mr Tsotsi 
20 
to be re-examined so that if possible he is done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is a sensible approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, so let’s take an adjournment 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Each of the remaining witnesses will 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 182 of 220 
 
not be – each of the remaining witnesses Chair will not be 
less than three hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will not be less than three hours. 
ADV SELEKE SC:   Will not be less than three hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay alright, let us take this 
adjournment and it is nearly twenty five past, shall we say 
we resume at quarter to, just to give a little bit more time 
to discuss. 
ADV SELEKE SC:   Indeed, yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so we will resume at quarter to 
10 
five.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   He will be asking you questions aimed at 
giving you a chance to clarify whatever he thinks might need 
clarification.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chairperson.  Just a few 
20 
points Mr Tsotsi that I would like you to clarify.  You were 
asked by the Chairperson earlier in your evidence that to the 
extent that you did not apply for the first term as a director 
and the fact that Mr Tony Gupta if I recall well would have 
intimated to you that we put you in we could take you out 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 183 of 220 
 
whether you knew how it came about that you were 
appointed.  Now in your evidence you mentioned that Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu approached you.  Do you want to tell 
the Chairperson what the nature of your relationship with Mr 
Mahlangu was that would have led him to approach you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair Mr Mahlangu and I got to know one 
another with the work that we were doing in the ANC.  And I 
had… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that you were doing? 
MR TSOTSI:  In the ANC the African National Congress. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you knew him from the ANC? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is prior to your taking your first term 
as Chairperson of the Eskom board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You knew him already? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  I used to lead some discussions within 
the workshops and the work that we were doing inside the 
20 
ANC and at times I would see him attending some of these 
and having had the experience I had when I was working for 
Eskom there were certain aspects which I was charged with 
to – to assist in growing the consciousness of you know part 
of the political school it will – work we were doing.  So 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 184 of 220 
 
Mahlangu got to know me then and I think out of that grew 
the interest once he was now senior enough and was now 
the advisor to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  It seems as though he latched onto those 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  That experience he and I had at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Did I understand you correctly that you 
10 
said you used to work for Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes of course I mean I think I – he also was 
aware that I worked for Eskom for what nine years in a 
senior capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is previously before you became 
Chairperson of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he knew you had experience of working 
at Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you very much.  If I may move 
to the next point then.  Mention was also made of the 
meeting that was initiated by Ms Dudu Myeni former 
Chairperson of the SAA and the fact that she facilitated this 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 185 of 220 
 
meeting according to your evidence which occurred as I 
recall on the 8 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just raise your voice Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you.  That occurred as I recall 
on the 8 March in Durban at the President’s residence.  Now 
please clarify in your own mind and knowledge why a 
member of another state owned entity unrelated to Eskom 
business would be in a position to facilitate a meeting 
between you as the current Chairperson and the President of 
the Republic? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair apart from having been colleagues with 
Dudu because we were both in the SOE space we knew one 
another in that fashion but I think in this instance the fact 
that I was aware that she had a close relationship with 
President Zuma and she chaired his foundation so – and 
besides that I do recall at some time in my communication 
with President Zuma that he did say to me that should I need 
to see him urgently I should feel free to ask Dudu to make 
arrangements for such a meeting.  So at the time then when 
Dudu came forth and said this … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Myeni 
MR TSOTSI:  Ms Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Myeni ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Said this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure that we – we stick 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 186 of 220 
 
to … 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is acceptable of course her name is 
Dudu but let us refer to her as Ms Myeni. 
MR TSOTSI:  So at the time when Ms Myeni made the call to 
me and the request I understood that indeed this is a 
plausible communication coming from the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  So I had no qualms about the fact that I am 
being called by somebody who is not related to the Eskom 
10 
business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to remember when it was that 
President Zuma said to you should you need to see him 
urgently or speak to him urgently you should free to connect 
Ms Myeni who would then make all the arrangements.  Are 
you able to remember around about when would – that would 
have been in terms of the year obviously.  I am not looking 
for the exact date. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair it could possibly have been maybe in 
2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. It could have been 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 187 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that have arisen out of any meeting 
that the Chairpersons of the boards of different SOE’s might 
have had with Mr Zuma?  Or you – you were having a 
meeting with him and he mentioned this.  It is not like you 
had a meeting with him and Ms Myeni and he mentioned this. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I – it was – I was having a discussion with 
him at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  In [00:08:08] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just the two of you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes just the two of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then he said should you need to 
see him urgently or talk to him urgently the person to contact 
would be Ms Myeni? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At that time did that surprise you or 
not really? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what you knew? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  It did not surprise me because as I said I knew 
that she had been at the time the Chairperson of the Jacob 
Zuma Foundation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And so her closeness with the President was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 188 of 220 
 
you know a matter of public knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall whether this meeting 
between you and him was at the Presidency or the 
Presidential residence Mahlamba Ndlovu or elsewhere? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair it was definitely not.  I – it could have 
been in Cape Town I just have a sense that there – 
something was happening in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  And I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  In his residence in the office or maybe 
10 
at some function? 
MR TSOTSI:  No it should have been at some function. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that it sounds strange to me 
because I would have thought that you – your discussion 
would have been that if you needed to talk to him about 
Eskom work, I am assuming it was during the time that you 
20 
were Chairperson of Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I would have thought that he would 
say and maybe he would not need to say this should you 
need to see me you can phone – you can phone my office 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 189 of 220 
 
and arrangements can be made.  So I am – it just seems 
strange to me that he would say if you need to see me 
urgently just contact Ms Myeni and he does not ask you to 
contact his office.  As I say he would not need to say that 
because you would know if you need to see him you contact 
his office.   
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I – I hear what you saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  But I did not put too much credence in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  It is just that it is a 
piece of information that you have just mentioned now and it 
is – yes Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chairperson.  If we may 
move to the point regarding the donation or support or put 
differently attendance to the ANC January AIDS dinner – 
business dinner as it was discussed in Nelspruit on the 2014 
– 2015 January if I understood well. Question was and 
correctly 
so 
why 
would 
Eskom 
being 
a 
state 
owned 
20 
enterprise be seen to be partisan in donation a political 
party?  Now your response obviously was what it was.  Did 
you perhaps try and follow through on this by any chance to 
verify what the true state of facts may be? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair I certainly was concerned about the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 190 of 220 
 
– your concern on this matter and I thought to myself maybe 
it might be useful if I could find and get some information on 
this.  And I spoke to a gentleman who at the time I was – at 
the time of this particular event was the Director of – or was 
the – yes the Director of Communications at Eskom.  And I 
sent him a message to say look I am at the commission and 
this matter has come up can you shed any light on whether 
actually Eskom actually paid money to the ANC or the ANC 
benefited financially from Eskom at the event.  And he sent 
me a message back to say as far as he recalls there were no 
10 
payments that were made to the ANC at that particular event.   
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  How was this communication received 
or sent by you? 
MR TSOTSI:  It was a whatsapp message yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  But with your permission Chairperson 
it appears as a very short exchange if I may ask you to just 
read it to number 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether – because I think it is 
something important.  Maybe the person could be asked to 
depose to an affidavit rather 
20 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To depose to an affidavit and I think the 
commission can just investigate further also.  So maybe he 
might not need to read it but. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  That should suffice. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 191 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that should suffice.  Ja. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Ja.  But certainly what is more 
important is what your understanding of why you had to 
honour the appearance at the ANC Gardena – what was your 
state of understanding? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes as I said I took it that there was an 
opportunity to state the support that Eskom is giving to its 
customers and to the public in general through the 49M 
Campaign and that there was an opportunity.  Apart from that 
to speak to a large customer base of Eskom both present in 
10 
the room in the form of the business people that were there 
and others who were there and especially those who were 
accessible by via the television of the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation.  So I took advantage of that and 
that is really the essential reason why I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Put differently were you aware at the 
time of appearance there that Eskom as was suggested 
would have paid a fee to – for you to sit at the table? 
MR TSOTSI:  No I was not aware at all.  That thought never 
20 
crossed my mind at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja I just was not aware Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  If I may move on I think this probably 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 192 of 220 
 
is my last point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  You mentioned that prior to the 
suggestion 
proposal 
instruction 
depending 
on 
who 
is 
listening and how they receive it about the inquiry into the 
affairs of Eskom that you yourself at some point harboured a 
view which you expressed to some of your board members 
perhaps in an informal session the previous year about an 
independent assessment as you put it.  Could you clarify 
what you meant by that? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Okay Chair what was in my mind at the time I 
was thinking about an independent assessment of Eskom’s 
situation was we needed to engage an inquiry that would 
illicit where the difficulties Eskom is experiencing are and as 
I said in my testimony by the time I was invited to the 
Presidency – to the President’s residence to talk about this 
the idea was not new to me at all.  I had canvassed the idea 
with a few individuals.   
At the time my thinking was that I would like with the 
permission of the stakeholders who would be interested or 
20 
impacted by this to put together a high – very high level 
think tank or an expert advisory body to deal with the Eskom 
situation.   
And the reason why I felt I needed to do this is 
because increasingly I was becoming aware of the fact that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 193 of 220 
 
Eskom is reaching a point where it cannot solve its own 
problem by its own.  And one reason for that Chairman is the 
tremendous amount of shall I say interest in Eskom from a 
variety of stakeholders.   
There 
are 
so 
many 
entities 
and 
bodies 
and 
individuals and so on that have a stake in the company that 
as you want to drive the business in one direction you run 
into a situation where a certain stakeholder is not happy with 
that direction and you try something else you think will work.  
The same thing happens.   
10 
So I felt there was a need for a very high level group 
of experts and I started to speak to some people primarily in 
the private sector at the time just to test the ground with 
certain people that I felt could be role players there.  Some 
from overseas.   
And so my idea was then coupling that with doing an 
inquiry on Eskom would then result in a situation where there 
is an independent understanding of where Eskom’s problems 
lie.  And so it would give the opportunity to an independent 
group of – or a group to see to what extent they can infuse 
20 
their own thinking and support of this to ensure that Eskom 
is able to get out of the situation that it is now relatively I am 
inhibited or encumbered by a lot of self-interest that exists 
already.   
So that is one of the reasons why I had an interest let 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 194 of 220 
 
alone the fact that obviously the company was bleeding and 
it needed to get some independent way of assessing what its 
problems are.  And obviously in such a process there was no 
contemplation of anything about suspensions and this sort of 
thing.   
So I just feel Chairman that unfortunately that 
process pretty much was hijacked and it defeated the whole 
intent that I in my mind had had to the extent that even I was 
removed from the situation.   
So there was – what I would call fairly noble reasons 
10 
why I had an interest in the whole question of an inquiry at 
Eskom.  It had very specific intents.  So I just thought that 
because I really did not elaborate on that I needed just to 
mention that and – there are people out there who know 
about this intention that I had. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Is there following through on this very 
point an organisation of a similar to Eskom anywhere else 
that perhaps strives and is a model you have wished to 
consider in that process? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair Eskom as being a member of an 
20 
international organisation consisting of other utilities and so 
one has had the opportunity to be exposed to very 
successful Eskom’s all over the world.   
And incidentally that you should ask that because I 
then even had the thought that is now down the line that with 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 195 of 220 
 
the difficulties that we are experiencing now one could 
contemplate some sort of partnership with a company that 
does exactly the same thing that Eskom does which 
practically mirrors Eskom and one of those companies is a 
company called CAPCO who is very successful Korean 
electricity company in South Korea.  It is a little – about one 
and a half times the size of Eskom but with the same 
vertically integrated setup as Eskom with the same energy 
mix as Eskom and even more.  
So I said to myself even in the current environment 
10 
where there is a lot of speculation out there about how to 
improve Eskom’s current performance where there are 
thoughts about private sector investments and this type of 
thing.  I just feel that had I had the opportunity I think we 
would have had a good chance to have good go at what we 
can do with Eskom given that there are other likeminded and 
like-structured entities such as the ones I am talking about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, when you talk about other 
Eskom’s of the world it is said that there was a time when 
our Eskom was the envy of the world.  That is how respected 
20 
it was once upon a time. 
MR TSOTSI:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Absolutely Chair.  Founded on very free, very 
basic principles. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 196 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  Produce and supply electricity at an affordable 
and reliable way.  Create employment with the purpose of 
creating expertise along with it and make sure that you are 
self-sustaining.  Those are the only three things Eskom is 
required to do.  That is the mandate Eskom had at its 
inception. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And that is exactly the same mandate Eskom 
has today.  So all you are doing – all we were striving for is 
10 
to bring Eskom back to that basic mandate of those three 
requirements that is all.  And I think the support Eskom can 
get exists out there without the concerns of privatisation and 
over corporatisation and all of those concerns that a lot of 
stakeholders at Eskom had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  And obviously you are talking about a 
government owned entity having a negotiated arrangement 
with another government owned entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  So I think there are ways we just need to be 
willing imaginative.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Thank you Chairperson I must indicate 
that Mr Tsotsi is quite passionate about this aspect and 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 197 of 220 
 
within the constraints of re-examination I will not take it 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is alright. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  But I thought it was important to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  To link as it were his concept of an 
assessment independent and what that would contemplate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  And the coincidence of an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  That in his evidence he says was 
hijacked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Now just to complete this point Mr 
Tsotsi.  You have said in your view this noble initiative of an 
inquiry standard to suspensions as you testified and others 
did appears to have been hijacked.  Now my intentions is not 
for us elaborate so much into that I am sure the Chairperson 
will make his own determination on the facts as he receives 
them.  However of interest I just want to understand if you 
20 
did take note and my apologies Chairperson, I may not be 
able to refer you to the exact pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Because I do not have the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 198 of 220 
 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  But certainly, my recollection of Doctor 
Ngubane’s affidavit amongst other things discloses that he 
has an erstwhile partner of Mr Salim Essa in a private 
business of their own which according to him says it never 
really took off.  Were you aware of this at the time that he 
joined the board? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chairman absolutely not. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Was this more importantly ever 
disclosed at any point under the declaration of interest if it 
so happened that there would be such? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  I would have known if that was the case and I 
do not recall that it happened. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Secondly and I am trying to rush.  Mr 
Romeo Kumalo public knowledge that he resigned fourteen 
months after appointment, you aware of that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I became aware of that. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Were you aware that he and Mr 
Pamensky were also co-directors of a company at some 
stage before appointment to Eskom board? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
20 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  As per the articles that were published 
in the newspapers. 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair I was not aware. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Now post your removal from Eskom 
certain developments occurred that included replacement of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 199 of 220 
 
executives.  And certain business dealings occurred.  Are 
you aware of any that occurred that appeared to have been 
aligned with Gupta interest or Gupta company interest? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  What is this noise?  You switch off 
cell phones.  Okay.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair in answer to the question.  Yes I am 
certainly became aware of the controversy that came about a 
few months after I had left Eskom and the change that 
occurred at Eskom of the executives that those – some of 
those executives got embroiled in an issue that had to do 
10 
with the purchase of Optimum Mine by the company Tegeta 
which company was owned purportedly by the Gupta family 
where in fact Eskom was said to have financed that 
purchase.  So yes I – from that perspective I became aware 
of that and – and subsequently other things that came to the 
fore. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:  Right and a very last one.  I believe it 
is again now this time I think it is Ms Brown the former 
Minister’s statement which inter alia intimated that she could 
not comprehend how as Chairman who merely had to deal 
20 
with four meetings a year a non-executive role and a staff of 
eleven.  Of course and a driver – full time driver.   
Of course you responded to this by saying that you only 
had two that were supporting you over and above access to 
the Chief Executive’s office whenever there was expertise 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 200 of 220 
 
required to support you.  But I am interested for you to 
clarify for the attention of the Chairperson the nature of your 
job  
a. What in your view and understanding was your key 
areas of performance as Chairperson?  And to expedite 
the thing two would be 
b. How often would you need to attend to Eskom business 
as it were in terms of your diary per week or per 
month? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair it is true that there are six formal 
10 
board meetings per year but you know the complexity of 
Eskom is testimony to the fact that though you may be a 
non-executive director you will not get away with less than 
two board meetings a month.  Sometimes more.   
So the whole response to the Eskom environment is driven 
by the fact that the company is extremely complex.  So the 
efforts that is required to keep abreast of what is going on in 
the business of Eskom is quite big.  It is – it requires for a 
non-executive director to be able to avail at least 60%, 70% 
of their time.  I am talking about a person who is in the role 
20 
of a chairman.  Now if you consider the key role in the 
organisation that a director has to undertake.   
 
Obviously, there is the control of the business and there 
is oversight of the business and then there is the strategic 
interest that Eskom has with stakeholders outside of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 201 of 220 
 
organisation which are a multiplicity of stakeholders.   
 
You know, there is parliament, there are the customers 
and there are all, this government itself a shareholder and 
the external stakeholder even outside of the country, 
institutions that Eskom belongs to.   
 
And you expected to be able to be visible as a business 
so that the concerns of the company has, are addressed and 
is seen to address adequately and that applies to non-
executive directors as well.   
 
So I think, I would say if one really truly understood the 
10 
role that the chairman of a company, such as Eskom, had to 
undertake, one would appreciate that the complexity of the 
business mandates that person be busy at least 67% of the 
time.   
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   So the proposition that you only had 
to attend to four board meetings a year, would that be 
accurate? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, of course not.  That is totally inaccurate.  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because as I have said, it is not attainable. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So based on what you have just about 
how many meetings you had to attend, it seems that it would 
be fair to say you may have had to attend, certainly, more 
than double than what the four or six that were mentioned.  
Actually, the meetings you had could be as high, as what, 16 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 202 of 220 
 
per year, in a year? 
MR TSOTSI:   Very easily. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, depending it could go to 20, even 
24 if it is two per month. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And sometimes more.  So it could easily 
go to over 20. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if you look at the number of meetings 
that your board had during your first term as chairperson at 
10 
that first board that you led.  Would the number of meetings 
that you are talking about based on what happened during 
the term when you say about two meetings a month, is it 
very much based on that experience of that first term? 
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because after all, in the second term 
you were not there much.  You were removed quite early. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  And, so that is quite a lot of 
meetings.  So.  Ja, okay.   
20 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Did you occupy an office at Eskom’s 
head office. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I am chairman.  Normally there is an 
office at Eskom and as I say a PA.  And the driver is not a 
full-time individual.  The driver will do work for the chairman 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 203 of 220 
 
for business of Eskom.  And once that is done with, then the 
driver is available to the organisation.  He is not dedicated 
to the chairman.  He drives whoever.  And there is always 
some need for that in the organisation. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Of more interest Mr Tsotsi.  Were you 
in a position to accept any other job at the time as a result of 
this appointment. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the point, Chairman.  It would have 
been virtually important to do another job.  It is actually not 
possible.  You cannot.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   I was offered a job and I had to turn it down.  
So there was no way I could do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  You just cannot.  Even the non-executive 
directors who are just directors in the company were 
experiencing some difficulties with their own jobs and having 
to attend to Eskom business.  So I knew that because at 
times people were unable to attend meetings because of 
commitments of work and so on.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So during your first term as chairperson of 
the Eskom board, you did not have any other full time job or 
you did not have a full time job because I guess the Eskom 
one was also not full time but it nevertheless took a lot of 
your time. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 204 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I could not hold on another job, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you say something along the lines 
that it took about 60% of your time, that is now being 
chairperson of Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, at least... I would estimate about 60% to 
70%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you spend a lot of time in the 
10 
office or most of the time you worked from home or from 
whatever office and only went to the Eskom office when 
there were to be meetings of the board or of committees that 
you had to attend or your meetings with some of the 
executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I did not go to the office every day.  I 
had an arrangement where I had an executive office who 
essentially looked after the office because she was there on 
a daily basis.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Often times, they would send documents to 
my house that I will have to deal with one way or another. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I resisted the temptation of spending 
everyday at the office because I had other things that I 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 205 of 220 
 
wanted to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you very much.  And if... I beg 
your pardon.  I know I said last time but I just need to make 
reference to this statement.  I think it is in page 224 of the 
Eskom Bundle 07A. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 224? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   224. 
MR TSOTSI:   024? 
10 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   It is 224. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Page number.  Eskom Bundle 07A.  
Statement by Nicholas Linnell.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is the statement of Mr Linnell? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   That is correct.  Did you find it Mr 
Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, 224.  I have it. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Now I just want to zoom into the 
matter of interest here which is on the last page, paragraph 
20 
53. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   It reads: 
“Given the nature of the work that I was anticipating 
being engaged to do, I have since the 11 t h been 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 206 of 220 
 
receiving information from anonymous sources that 
might be relevant to an inquiry of this nature, 
amongst others, if the people would want, that the 
CEO had been given advanced warning of his 
possible suspension prior to the 11t h.” 
 
At 53.2.: 
“That the minister met privately with some of the 
board members prior to the formal meeting of the 
11t h.” 
 
At 53.3. 
10 
“That 
the 
minister 
had 
previously 
cancelled 
a 
scheduled board meeting on the 29 t h of February...” 
 
I suppose he means the 26t h, but any way. 
“...as is it had come to her knowledge that the board 
used to raise the issue of no-confidence to the 
chairman.  This was presumable well before the 
inquiry was ever made.” 
 
Now are you aware of this?  Are you aware of any of 
these allegations contained in Mr Linnell’s statement? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am only aware of I think J1.  That was the 
20 
one which relates to the probable reason for the cancellation 
or postponement of the meeting of the 29 t h.  I am sorry, the 
26t h actually.  That there was an attempt to affect a notion of 
no-confidence in the chairman.  That I have heard prior to 
seeing this here. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 207 of 220 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Let us clarify.  Did you hear prior to 
seeing it here or you had not heard prior to seeing it here? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I heard about it.  Nick had told me about 
it.  We spoke about it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
was 
that 
prior 
to 
the 
11t h of March 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, that would have been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you hear about it before the meeting 
of the 11t h of March 2015 or did you hear about it only later? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   It probably would have been shortly thereafter 
Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shortly after the 11t h of March. 
MR TSOTSI:   I think so.  The environment was such that 
Nick himself was unhappy about what was going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Subsequently so.  I think we were talking what 
could be the goings-on, if you like ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR TSOTSI:   ...round the, you know, Eskom engagements.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  Okay. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Paragraph 53.4: 
“That the board, in fact, informed the minister on the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 208 of 220 
 
20t h of their determination to remove the chairman.” 
 
Were you aware of this? 
MR TSOTSI:   Now, the 20t h... I am trying to understand in 
relation to... yes, this I was aware of.  I mentioned this in my 
testimony. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   You say the 20t h.  The 20t h of which 
month if I may just confirm? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay the 20t h of March. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   20 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  You recall Chairman I say ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Let us go onto the next one. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Paragraph 53.5: 
“That the minister was reported having told the 
portfolio committee on the 26t h or thereabouts that 
she was expecting a formal letter with regard to the 
board’s intention to remove the chairman.” 
 
That you were also aware of or not? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I am not aware.  I presume they are 
talking about the 26t h of March. 
20 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Of interest to me is that Mr Nick 
Linnell in this statement that you say it was said to you, 
appears to suggest very clearly that prior to the first ordinary 
meeting of the board that was scheduled that ultimately was 
cancelled at the eleventh hour, there was already the view 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 209 of 220 
 
that you must be – notion of no-confidence. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I think in simple terms Chair – I even 
think it may be laughable because there would have been no 
basis for anything like that.  It would have been the first 
board meeting.  I think it would have... I do not know what to 
say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you gave evidence that Minister 
Brown had told you early in 2015 that if you did not stop 
interfering in certain matters, she would find somebody else 
to do your job.  And you have said that you were told by Mr 
10 
Tony Gupta early in 2015 that they had put you into this 
position and they could take you out. 
 
Were there any other people who ever spoke to you 
about you being out of this position as chairperson of the 
board other than those two? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to the 11t h of March. 
MR TSOTSI:   After? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to the 11t h of March.  Because my 
recollection is that these two spoke to you prior to the 
20 
11t h off March.  Actually, either January or February. The one 
was around the SONA time, is it not? 
MR TSOTSI:   Both were around the SONA time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Both of them around.  On the same day, 
by the way? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 210 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and SONA would have been either bee 
in January or early February.  Do you remember whether it 
was in January or February, the SONA 
MR TSOTSI:   The SONA would have been most likely early 
February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Early February. 
MR TSOTSI:   Early February, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So early February 2015, you are told by 
these two people, different times but same day, they – each 
10 
tell you something about you possible no longer being in this 
position.   
 
And about a month later you start sensing certain things 
within the board but two months do not – you do not last 
more than two months after that because you would then end 
up resigning on the 30t h of March.   
 
So it takes two months after you are told, about two 
months after you are told these things by the two people and 
you are out of Eskom, you are out of this position. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Chair, I am trying to think.  I cannot 
20 
recall other than those two occasions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ys. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...if I had been told or had heard that I would 
be facing a notion of no-confidence.  On the basis of the 
rational you are raising now, it seem to me that had that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 211 of 220 
 
been the intend of it, that would have been the genesis of it 
because there would be nothing else that the board members 
would have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But members - as you said when you 
spoke to the minister when she said there are complaints 
from some board members and from the executives about 
you interfering.   
 
You said:  Board members hardly know how I look like.  
So they did not know much about you.  There was not 
enough time for them to come to any conclusion about 
10 
whether you should be chairperson or not in terms of your 
performance. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, and thus make of some external 
influence, really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Should it have been, I should have come to 
pass, it would clearly would have been external influence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay.   
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Before I 
formally conclude.  Is there anything on your side that you 
20 
feel perhaps needed clarity that we may not have covered? 
MR TSOTSI:   The only thing that I think I have mentioned in 
my affidavit Chair.  It has to do with what transpired out of 
the Gupta email leaks.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 212 of 220 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I mention there that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To the Gupta leaks? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I mention there Chairman that the – a certain 
gentleman named Mr Goha who worked in the Gupta 
companies.  Apparently ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Was he the TMA Editor? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am not sure whether he was the actual editor 
10 
but he was involved in ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Yes, proceed.  Gupta business. 
MR TSOTSI:   And there is an email which is attributed to Mr 
Goha which is addressed to Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And this email deals with an offer of 
assistance by Mr Goha to Dr Ngubane in the drafting of a 
letter resignation of myself.  And this communication occurs 
approximately ten days before I resigned.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So that would be around 20 March? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   Unfortunately, I do not have the requisite 
documents but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, the Commission has got a hard 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 213 of 220 
 
drive that is helpful in this regard.  The... it might be that 
one or other work stream of the Commission has got that.  I 
think they – the legal team investigators will find that.  They 
will find that and they will communicate with you so that you 
can have a copy that would be brought to the hearing as well 
so that it forms part of this. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair I would happy because I think it 
reinforces my proposition that there has been an external 
hand in all of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   And that invariable it seems to point to the 
Gupta Family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And it has come as no surprise.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Considering the threat that I have received 
from Tony Gupta some month or so before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I just thought, it also obviously reflects on 
the what would be collusion between that family and 
20 
members of the board, who were board members along with 
me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.   
MR TSOTSI:   If indeed the veracity of that email is 
confirmed.  It would certainly clarify some aspect which has 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 214 of 220 
 
got to do with this relationship with the board members with 
the Gupta Family.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Of course, I think you have said that 
Mr Tony Gupta had accused you at some stage of not 
assisting them.  Is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, I have had a lot of evidence in 
this Commission since August 2018 when the Commission 
started hearing evidence.   
 
I have heard evidence from Mr Themba Maseko who said 
10 
Mr R J Gupta said to him in effect, you know, anybody that 
does not want to cooperate with us, in talking about 
ministers and I assume DG’s, you know, we report to the 
president, President Zuma.   
 
And as I recall, Mr Themba Maseko said Mr J R Gupta 
said to them that person would be dealt with.   
 
But ultimately, either on that occasion or another 
occasion, according to Mr Maseko, R J Gupta said:  Well... 
he said to him... No, it was another occasion.  He said:  
Well, you are not cooperating with us.  So I will report you to 
20 
your seniors and they will replace you.   
 
So if that evidence of Mr Maseko is true, and at this 
stage it stands unchallenged, then it would mean that Mr R J 
Gupta may have reflected on how they operated.  Mr Maseko 
is subsequently moved from his position at UCIS.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 215 of 220 
 
 
And in circumstances where, about six weeks or so 
before that, his minister was part of a panel that assessed 
his performance at UCIS and gave him more than 100% 
points to show how happy they were with his performance in 
his job.  He was moved.  And ultimately had to get out of the 
public service.   
 
Mr Jonas gave evidence before me and said that he had 
a 
meeting 
at 
the 
Gupta 
residence 
on 
the 
23 rd of October 2015.  That is the same year we are talking 
about.   
10 
 
He said one of the Gupta brothers – and it does appear 
that it would have been Tony Gupta because it is common 
cause that he was in the house and he was the only Gupta 
brother in the house on that day.   
 
So if Mr Jonas’ evidence is correct, is true and I know 
that Mr Duduzane Zuma denies it.  Mr Shongwane denies it.  
So I will still assess and see which version is true.   
 
But if Mr Jonas’ evidence – version is true, then the 
position would be that, according to him, Mr Tony Gupta told 
him Mr Nene was going to be fired by President Zuma 
20 
because he was not working with them and they wanted Mr 
Jonas to work with them and take the job of the Minister of 
Finance.   
 
And six weeks or some weeks later, Mr Nene was fired.  
He was fired in circumstances that seemed very strange as 
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 216 of 220 
 
well.  Tony Gupta was allegedly involved there.   
 
Mr Kona was Chairpersons of the SAA Board.  I cannot 
remember the year.  Maybe 2011.  I am not sure or 
thereabout.  And he was made acting CEO.  He has given 
evidence and said he was called to a meeting at the Gupta 
residence where Mr Tony Gupta was there and I think Mr 
Duduzane Zuma was there as well.   
 
He effectively was asked to facilitate some job for the 
Guptas or something, a contract and he was offered initially, 
I think, R 100 00,00. And when he did not take that, I think 
10 
he said it was increased to R 500 00,00.  He did not take it.  
It did not take long before he was removed from that 
position.    
 
Mr Dukwana has given evidence before.  Mr Dukwana 
was an MEC in the Free State Government.  He gave 
evidence that he was taken by Mr Magashule to the Gupta 
residence.   
 
Ja, I think he went there on two occasions but to one of 
the occasion, Mr Tony Gupta – or on both occasions, Mr 
Gupta – I think it was – he met with him and Mr Duduzane 
20 
Zuma was there too.   
 
He says Mr Tony Gupta wanted him to sign a certain 
document 
which 
would 
have 
given 
the 
Gupta’s 
some 
contracts in his Department of Agriculture if I remember 
correctly.  He refused.  He offered him a lot of money.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 264 
 
Page 217 of 220 
 
 
He said he did not know how much but he said it was full 
in a briefcase similar to a briefcase that lawyers carry.  He 
said it was open, it was full of notes there.  He turned it 
down.   
 
Of course, he was later removed from the position of 
Being an MEC but he says he was told by Mr Magashule that 
he was being removed in order to make space for a woman 
so that there will be more women in the executive council.  I 
am sure there are other stories.   
 
So you had interactions with Mr Tony Gupta who

threatened you with taking you out of this position?  And Mr 
Jonas - one of the things that Mr Jonas said was that the 
Gupta brother who was in the meeting with him on the 23rd 
of October, told him that there were a number of people who 
worked with them, worked with the Gupta's and he mentioned 
some.   
 
And amongst those that you mentioned was Miss Lynn 
Brown and Brian Molefe.  And Mr Jonas - this Gupta brother 
told him that these ones that worked with them the careers 
were fine.  They will be well- looked after.

So when I look at your evidence and what you say 
happened to you, I have to look at the totality of the 
evidence I have been hearing and I am just mentioning some 
parts of evidence that I have that info of Mr Tony Gupta and 
the other people.
