PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 6 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody.  You will have to switch on your microphone.  I 
have been told that there are challenges with the light or 
now hopefully it is going to be sorted out in a matter of 
minutes but I think I can – I can read what is in front of me 
but the lighting is quite bad where you are Mr Notshe.  Just 
speak to Mr Stimela behind you Mr Notshe to find out what – 
what is the latest.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair I am informed that it – it will take 
10 
about ten to fifteen minutes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten to fifteen minutes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  But for me the lighting is fine I can 
read and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ja.  I am not shaking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think there is a further message 
coming to you.  Ja.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we are – I am told that if 
you can read I can and the witness can read the cameras 
20 
will be able to roll until tea time then they can sort it out.  
So they say we can proceed if the participants... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Participants can read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay no that is fine so it will not 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 4 of 90 
 
affect your – this lightning. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It seems as if it will not.  They say the 
camera will roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Okay alright.  Okay let us start. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson before we get to the – the 
witness.  The – today was scheduled for two witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr – it was scheduled two witness Mr 
Cedric Frolick and the witness who will testify Mr Charl Le 
Roux.  Unhappily Mr Frolick physically indisposed as he is 
10 
unable to attend which would leave can then be – his 
testimony be postponed [00:03:22] and then we arrange 
another date for his testimony.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Today and this week we were going 
to – I was going to hear evidence for at least I think two or 
three days relating to Bosasa.  Mr Cedric Frolick had 
applied for Leave to Adduce to give evidence and to deal 
with the allegations made against him by Mr Agrizzi in 
relation to Bosasa and – and the arrangements had been 
that he would come today.  But as Mr Notshe indicates he is 
20 
apparently unwell and we will have to adjourn the hearing of 
his evidence to a date to be determined the Chairperson in 
due course.  So the hearing of Mr Frolick’s evidence is 
therefore adjourned.  But the evidence that we – I will hear 
from another witness also relates to Bosasa.  Do you want 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 5 of 90 
 
to take it from there Mr Notshe just to give the context? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson today the witness who is 
scheduled to testify is Mr Charl Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The genesis of his evidence is the 
evidence of Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And in the statement given by Mr Agrizzi 
paragraph 22 of Mr Agrizzi’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He refers to repairs … 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Maybe you can – if you refer to a 
paragraph you can indicate what that statement of Agrizzi is 
– what date it was given because he gave a few. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affidavits just for the record so that 
whoever reads the transcripts knows how to identify the one 
that you are referring. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Mr Chairperson.  Chairperson it is 
the – the statement of Mr Agrizzi – I just want to get it 
20 
there.  It is AA – it is Exhibit AA004 this is the first 
statement that he gave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the date? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Excuse me Chairperson I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that the Exhibit number? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 6 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is the Exhibit number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. AA? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is AA – it is AA and then it starts at 
AA01. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But the statement is given the number 
AA – Exhibit AA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  AA okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  But then what will help the AA we 
will have – because I can then take the Chairperson to the 
10 
relevant paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you do not have the last page of the 
affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Let me get to the last page of the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because that will help indicate when he 
deposed to the affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  The affidavit Chairperson is dated 
the – the 15 January 2019.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes then you can go to the 
20 
paragraph that you said. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then to paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least the reader of the transcript will be 
able to… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  To follow yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 7 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – to identify which affidavit of Mr 
Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are talking about. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  It is – the relevant part of Mr 
Agrizzi’s statement is paragraph 22 and page AA036 of the 
– of the – of the Exhibit.  It is the genesis if they – there 
Chairperson you – one will see that it is – it is given a 
specific 
heading 
of 
Nomvula 
Mokonyane 
and 
in 
that 
paragraph he then deals with the [indistinct] things, the 
10 
repairs that were done at the house of Ms Mokonyane – Ms 
Mokonyane.  And thereafter the – the – Mr Richard Le Roux 
– Mr Richard Le Roux’s statement also refers to the – let 
me just take you to it.  It is T3 the evidence – the statement 
of Richard Le Roux wherein he also refers to the repairs 
that were done at the house of Ms Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Where – where is – where are the 
other – where is Mr Agrizzi’s statement and everything?  I 
had asked that I should have it with me.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Mr Chairperson it is printed – it has 
20 
been – there was a problem with the office printers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But fortunately, we found a printer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is being printed as – as we speak. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 8 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What we have done we have printed 
three statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There is the statement – the statement I 
have referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
Then 
there 
is 
a 
supplementary 
statement after he testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There were issues that you raised and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That were raised during the hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He made a supplementary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And also, there was a statement – and a 
response to Ms Mokonyane’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Wherein he gives you those.  Those will 
20 
be presented shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay including Ms Mokonyane’s 
affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Including Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 9 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Chair this morning as a result 
– yesterday arrangement will be – legal representation of 
Ms Mokonyane we visited her home and – and the – the 
only purpose for this 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, maybe before we get there let me just 
give the context as I recall it from the evidence and 
affidavits of Mr Agrizzi and the affidavit of Ms Mokonyane.  
Mr Agrizzi gave evidence last year implicating a number of 
people including some politicians and among other things 
he testified that while he was at Bosasa there were a 
10 
number of people who were paid – who were given monthly 
payments by Bosasa and he said Ms Nomvula Mokonyane 
was one of them.  And also, evidence was led by him as 
well as Mr Richard Le Roux to the effect that there was a 
project within Bosasa I cannot remember what they called it 
in terms of which Bosasa installed CCTV cameras and other 
security equipment at the homes of certain people.  And he 
mentioned Ms Mokonyane’s home as one of the – they – 
that is Mr Agrizzi and Mr Richard Le Roux I think mentioned 
Ms Mokonyane’s home as one of the homes of certain 
20 
people 
in 
which 
Bosasa 
installed 
certain 
security 
equipment.  And Mr Agrizzi also gave evidence to the effect 
that he visited Ms Mokonyane’s residence.  It may be that 
he said different residences if he went to both residences 
that the official residence and the personal residence and 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 10 of 90 
 
he said on one occasion he went to Ms Mokonyane’s 
residence together with Mr Gavin Watson and they met with 
Ms Mokonyane and he said – I think he said it was on that 
occasion that Mr Watson had brought money for Mr – or Ms 
Mokonyane 
which 
was 
either 
– 
it 
was 
given 
to 
Ms 
Mokonyane or was left on the chair in the house.  I cannot 
remember the details.  And there was also evidence by Mr 
Agrizzi that I think there were deliveries that were sent to 
Ms Mokonyane from Bosasa. Of course, there is on a 
number 
of 
occasions. 
 
The 
commission 
asked 
Ms 
10 
Mokonyane to depose to an affidavit and deal with these 
allegations and she dealt – she co-operated and she 
submitted an affidavit in which she gives her side of the 
story.  My recollection is that she denied that Bosasa had – 
was paying her – or had paid her any money as alleged by 
Mr Agrizzi and he – she also said that Mr Agrizzi had never 
been to her house if I recall correctly.  And the commission 
then continued to make investigations arising out of Ms 
Mokonyane’s denial.  And the evidence that will be led 
today 
by 
Mr 
Charl 
Le 
Roux 
relates 
to 
the 
further 
20 
investigation conducted by the commission.  And Mr Notshe 
will also talk about a visit to Mr Mokonyane’s residence 
yesterday where her lawyers were present.  And as I 
understand the position there was much co-operation from 
Ms 
Mokonyane 
and 
her 
lawyers 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 11 of 90 
 
investigation and their visit to her home yesterday.  Mr 
Notshe.  I thought let me just put that myself. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you – you are new in the 
commission. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I have been around so I can 
remember some of these things because the affidavits are 
not here yet. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes thank you – thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is just important so that everybody 
who listens to the evidence that is led today can remember 
the context. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is this evidence about.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Well thank you Chair the – as fair as 
recalled the project regarding Ms Mokonyane and was 
called Project Blouberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I think it is because of the house is in 
20 
Blouberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was another – there was – I think 
there was a general name for the project of installing 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 12 of 90 
 
security equipment at the residences of different people but 
it may be that they called it according to each person.  Like 
Project Blouberg or Project PRASA or Project something 
else. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the way I understand Mr Agrizzi’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The whole issue of repairs and all that 
generally was called Project Shiftron. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then by then there was sub-projects 
under it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Of different residences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then the one in Blouberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:    It was called Project Blouberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – Blouberg okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair and thank you for the 
assistance you gave me.  Chair the – the before the witness 
does testifying we – yesterday and by agreement between 
us or the commission and the legal representatives of Ms 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 13 of 90 
 
Mokonyane we met at Ms Mokonyane’s house and the 
purpose was to confirm the features that were identified by 
a [indistinct] by Mr Le Roux in his statement that he saw 
when he went to do some repairs at Ms Mokonyane’s house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, actually rather than to confirm to see 
whether they are there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  To see whether that they are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Chair at the end of the 
inspection we then sat down and recorded what had been – 
10 
what we had seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And pointed out by Mr Charl Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And which will give and by agreement 
between the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I beg leave to read this into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And Chair understand it is also in your 
20 
bundle Exhibit T13 and it is on page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry just repeat that I 
missed that. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And this statement – this memorandum 
of agreement it should be in the Chair ’s bundle as well – in 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 14 of 90 
 
the commission bundle Exhibit 13 – T13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  T13. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The – okay maybe what we will do 
I know that I have confused some of the members of the 
legal team.  Shall we call this Bundle something that is the 
lever arch and Mr Charl Le Roux’s statement Exhibit 13 and 
its annexures.  Is that fine if we do it that way? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The – what we have Chair is – is it in 
Exhibit R13? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no what I am saying is, shall we say 
Exhibit T13 is Mr Charl Le Roux’s affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  And annexures but the box we call it 
bundles we give it a bundle number or bundle a letter 
bundle or something.  So that it is clear that the exhibit is 
not the box. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Oh I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the affidavit that is the Exhibit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can I just confer with my 
20 
attorney? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm.  Or alternative… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It – I am advised that we will after I 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 15 of 90 
 
have handed up the exhibit – I mean the – formally handed 
up to you this exhibit 13 I am referring to we will then give it 
a bundle number which will be Bundle A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  And if – if you know 
there are different bundles that are being – that have been 
used.  I know that certainly under the PRASA work stream I 
think they have following through with my inference handing 
up these lever arch files as bundle B or bundle whatever 
and then the affidavits inside would be Exhibit this, Exhibit 
that and Exhibit that.  But if what is most important for now 
10 
is the Exhibit for the – for the affidavit. The bundle number 
or 
bundle 
letter, 
Bundle 
A 
or 
whatever 
that 
is 
for 
convenience and that can be – can be attended to ever 
later. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not have to go into the record 
as such but it is convenient if everybody knows that you will 
find Exhibit 13 in Bundle so and so. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So and so I understand, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson we will attend to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Before – before we adjourn today I – we 
will have attended to it so that it also goes to the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the record yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 16 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As – and we will find bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair before… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Before I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe let me – let me get this out of 
the way.  The – you see I see that there is a state – there is 
an affidavit also of Van Biljon. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that will have to have a separate or 
10 
exhibit number.  So the one that will be T13 is that of Mr 
Charl Le Roux. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but we – we can deal with that if and 
when we come to it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one for Van Biljon. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Van Biljon yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the affidavit of Mr Charl Le Roux – 
Charl Jax Le Roux is admitted and is to be marked Exhibit 
20 
T13, 13. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As the Chairperson pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together with his annexures. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As the Chairperson pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 17 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair with you leave and your guidance 
the – the memorandum or the minute of yesterday’s 
inspection that will form part of the affidavit of Mr Le Roux.  
Should we have – should we have a separate exhibit 
number? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it should have a separate exhibit 
number but maybe the best time to hand up might be at the 
end of his evidence.  I do not know what you think about 
that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson that – that is also fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you will… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He would have testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He will have testified and then you 
say here is an agreement that was signed after the visit – at 
the end of the visit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Chair can I then move – and 
20 
then also the – what I had – but we will deal – we can deal 
with it after he has testified.  The – because he was 
employed by Mr Van Biljon so I was planning but we can do 
it the other way around.  I was planning first to deal with 
the – sorry – sorry Chair.  I was planning to deal with the 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 18 of 90 
 
evidence and read into the record the affidavit of Mr Van 
Biljon but Chair it does not matter.  Let the witness testify 
and then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then we will deal with the other 
issues thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The – it depends on what the – what 
sequence you – you want.  I do not mind if you refer to – 
well to the affidavit of Mr Van Biljon.  It does seem to me 
that to the extent that agreement who has been reached on 
10 
things that were seen in the – in Ms Mokonyane’s residence 
it may be that her affidavit or his affidavit – Mr Van Biljon’s 
will not be challenged.  So I think you – you can – we can 
get it admitted as an Exhibit and you can read the relevant 
portions thereof.  If later on they challenge it we will look at 
that.  You – as I understand the position Mr Van Biljon left 
South African. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last year I think. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He now lives in New Zealand. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So calling him may not be necessary if a 
lot of what he says is not being challenged. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 19 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also, if it is covered by what Mr Charl 
Le Roux says we – it might not be necessary to call him 
here but the affidavit could be [indistinct] enough. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously Ms Mokonyane and her lawyers 
will be free to challenge whatever they wish to challenge. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the – the affidavit of Mr Van Biljon 
you will find it – it is in two places in the – in T13 and it is 
10 
on T13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember when you say T13 you talk 
about Mr Charl Le Roux’s affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chair that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they better give it an exhibit of its own 
– an exhibit number of its own if you are going to refer to a 
number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can I made a [indistinct] can I make this 
– can I make this proposal? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And so that this is formally changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Can I leave for now the affidavit of Mr 
Van Biljon until the secretary would have given it a 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 20 of 90 
 
separate… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Ja.  That is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  A separate number so that when I read 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Because I understand Chair it will cause 
a confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  If I talk about T13 later on is admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What – what – but what – what can 
be done is that different exhibits namely different affidavits 
can be in the same lever arch file.  What is important is to 
always identify the correct exhibit number for the correct 
affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it could still remain here if we know for 
example – if we mark it as Exhibit T14. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then when you refer to it you say I am 
referring to Exhibit T14. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  Then we can still use it later 
on you – you will mark the lever arch file as Bundle 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 21 of 90 
 
whatever and in the spine – on the spine of the lever arch 
file. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It becomes – you make it clear that the 
contents are Exhibit T13 and Exhibit T14.  So whoever picks 
up the lever arch file. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Knows what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Knows that the contents are these two 
exhibits. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if there is an index that will 
show where to find each one of those exhibits. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words, I am saying it is up to 
you – we can still deal with Ms Van – Mr Van Biljon’s 
affidavit now but we would need to give it an exhibit number 
first.  If you are able to give it an exhibit number now but if 
you cannot give it an exhibit number now then we can deal 
with it later when you are ready to give it an exhibit number. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair with your leave can it then be 
20 
recorded that Mr Van Biljon’s affidavit will be T14?  Did we 
not start from page 18? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Renier van Biljon, his affidavit. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...will be admitted and marked as Exhibit 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 22 of 90 
 
T14. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the affidavit and its annexures. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  That is on T14, page 38, CLR38.  It is 
the commissioned statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  CLR38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You want me to go to page 38? 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, Chair.  Just to... I am just indicating 
that commissioned... and I want it to go on record that the 
commissioned statement starts from 38 to 42 because before 
that, it is a mere statement that has been signed but it was 
not commissioned.  It had to be sent back to have it 
commissioned, properly commissioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you know what we must do?  Are they 
not identical the statement and the affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  They are identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why do we need the statement?  Why 
20 
do we not just have the affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the identity... I guess because we have 
now given... you have paginated them all.  It could cause 
some problems here.  Then we should rather simply say, the 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 23 of 90 
 
statement has opposed to affidavit, is the one that is Exhibit 
T or D. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether the statement had 
annexures? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The statement has annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so the statement of Mr Renier, R-e-n-i-
e-r van Biljon.  Biljon is B-i-l-j-o-n.  His statement dated... it 
is undated. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is undated statement, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The undated statement together with its 
annexures will be Exhibit J14.  And his affidavit will be 
admitted and marked Exhibit T15.   
 
So I am correct in what I said earlier on.  I said earlier 
on, the affidavit of Mr Renier van Biljon would be admitted 
and marked as Exhibit T14.   
 
I am changing that.  Exhibit T14 is his statement.  
Exhibit T15 is his affidavit and the affidavit is dated or was 
deposed to on the 2n d of July 2020. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is together with its annexures and 
that will be Exhibit T14. 
RICHARD LE ROUX’S STATEMENT WITH ANNEXURES ARE 
HANDED UP AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT T14 
RICHARD LE ROUX’S AFFIDAVIT IS HANDED UP AND 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 24 of 90 
 
MARKED AS EXHIBIT T15 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, it is a short affidavit that I can 
quickly read into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I start reading.  It is: 
“I the undersigned Renier van Biljon do...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Um, okay.  Until you got... I do not think 
you should read it into the record as such but you... if you 
10 
want to read a particular portion of it, you can do it.  
Otherwise, you can just say what the gist of his evidence or 
the crust of his evidence in that affidavit is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is available as an affidavit.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The... Chairperson, the... it merely refers 
to the... what is relevant for today is his reference to the 
work done at Mr Mokoena’s house.  And that appears on 
page T15, CLR39, paragraph 6 of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think he... his evidence on the 
20 
affidavit is briefly that he... he is a qualified electrician and 
that in 2015 he owned a company... what is his company 
called?   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He owned a company which used to get 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 25 of 90 
 
work from Bosasa.  Bosasa would sub-contract it to do 
certain work for Bosasa and he...  
 
This seems to have started when he attended a call-out 
in 2015 at Mr Agrizzi’s home and he used to work with... I 
will get instructions from Mr Richard le Roux from Bosasa. 
 
Well, maybe I was wrong to restrict you Mr Notshe not 
reading.  Can I leave it to you if you want to read it? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chairperson, just to... I think paragraph 
6 just gives the context and then paragraph 7 then deals with 
the with the work of where the witness did some work.  And I 
10 
just quickly read that paragraph 6.  And he says: 
“To my knowledge, I was doing the work for Bosasa 
as a sub-contractor in the usual manner in which we 
operated was as follows. 
Mr Le Roux would inform me of an address where 
services were to be provided and I would meet him 
on the side.  
I would evaluate the work to be done and then quote 
Bosasa for this work, stipulating the items required 
such as CCTV fittings and the like. 
20 
I would not stipulate the residential address on the 
quotation but would simply refer to Bosasa on the 
quotation, for example, if the pumps for the water 
feature had to be changed at a residence, the 
heading of the quotation would merely state “water 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 26 of 90 
 
feature pump”. 
As a freelance electrician I sub-contracted and it was 
normal for me to quote by simply placing “water pump 
replaced” as the wording of the quote and invoice. 
This were never high-value jobs.   
In certain instances, I would purchase equipment in 
order to affect the repairs and in other instances, 
Bosasa would purchase the items and provide this to 
me. 
I would then commence with the work and invoice 
10 
Bosasa after completion. 
All the quotations and invoices were made out to 
either Bosasa and/or Richard.   
There was normally no mention of address where the 
work was provided on the quotation or invoice. 
I recall this as I had to redo certain quotations and 
invoices, making sure that there was no mention of 
the address. 
His instructions were given to me by Mr Le Roux.” 
 
There where... in the reference here with Mr le Roux, 
20 
Richard le Roux, not the witness. 
“I would email the quotations and invoices to Mr le 
Roux who would then arrange for payment into my 
account.” 
 
And then the heading “Work performed at Minister 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 27 of 90 
 
Mokoena’s residence”, paragraph 7: 
“I recalled that I performed work at house number 
105, Blouberg Street, Krugersdorp. 
The Commission’s investigation’s team has provided 
me...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Um... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, can I continue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am thinking of... I think the residential 
address, do not mention it... do not read it into the record.  
Just mention that the address is given for security reasons. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  My understand... I 
understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, from then... from now onwards, we... 
although it is on the record, I will not mention it in reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then he says he was given the 
annexure by the investigators... he was given the annexure 
RVB1.  RVB1 shall be page 23 of the bundle.  And then he 
says...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I am just thinking about the issue... 
Well, one is trying to be sensitive to security issues but this 
witness, for example, needed to specify in his affidavit what 
the address was, just like Mr Biljon needed to specify 
because there was a denial that Bosasa had...[intervenes]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 28 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Gone to the residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So there was a need to do that.  So 
that it made it necessary.  Also, they implicate that they 
know what address as they were talking about but maybe 
even when he gives evidence, we all now know which 
residence he is talking about.   
 
Maybe he could say that it is the residence given in his 
affidavit without mentioning the street number and so on. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just trying to see how one strikes a 
10 
balance...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...between... 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The... Chair, the way I see it, especially 
with yesterday which makes me now know the premises that 
we visited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no need to...[intervenes]  
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
The 
witness, 
when 
I... 
when 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja....[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...when he will testify...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja., 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...we advise him just to refer if he wants 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 29 of 90 
 
to talk about, “the residence that we visited”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And that ...[indistinct] the residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We have agreed that this is the 
residence that we have visited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja-no, that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And as I understand it Chair, it is all 
done for the purpose of security. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
10 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
So 
that 
one 
does 
not 
expose 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...the people to unnecessarily insecurity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Chair, on page 23 the... Mr van 
Biljon tells the Commission that on page was shown 
photographs 
and 
on 
pages 
23 
and 
24, 
he 
confirms 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I was at page 40 when... I 
20 
thought you were at page 40.  I am not referring to CLR.  At 
page 40, when I thought you were... I thought you were at 
paragraph 8. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, at paragraph 8.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 30 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, what I wanted... so I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are going to annexures. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I beg your pardon.  What I had done is I 
had removed the statement instead of moving to the 
affidavit.  I was reading from the... no, which is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go to the affidavit because that 
is...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  No, I am going back to the 
affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now he confirms that the photographs 
that were sent to him, is the photograph of the “house that 
we visited”.  And then he confirmed that in addition, he was 
also provided with the deeds of this document of that 
address and there is a deed registry extract which gives the 
owners of the residence as Mr and Mrs Mokoena. 
 
And on the affidavit and on the document, their names 
and ID documents are there.  And I, with your leave, I would 
not read them into the record but they are. 
20 
 
And then he says that he was informed that Nomvula 
Mokoena was a minister of parliament.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am quite happy for you to read as you are 
reading. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is it... okay, I have been informed by... I 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 31 of 90 
 
am now at paragraph 10 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   
“I 
have 
been 
informed 
by 
the 
Commission’s 
investigating team that Nomvula Paula Mokoena was 
a 
minister 
of 
parliament 
in 
the 
South 
African 
Government.  I have checked an open source media 
where it is reported that a certain Mokoena was the 
husband of Ms Nomvula and died in April 2019. 
At the time I was unaware that the house in Blouberg 
10 
Street belonged to or was occupied by Minister 
Mokoena.  
The fact that there were two police officers at the 
main gate, obviously, alerted me to the fact that it 
was occupied by someone important. 
On one occasion I was called to the house one 
evening to attend to the backup power system where 
the generator system would not start and met such. 
He was a friendly guy but he did not mention his 
surname and did not mention his wife’s position. 
20 
On most occasions, Mr le Roux met on site at 105 
Blouberg Street and he showed me what needed to 
be done.   
I think in all of the time that I did work at this site, 
there was possible two occasions where I went to the 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 32 of 90 
 
Blouberg site without Mr le Roux being present, and 
below is a list of some of the things I recalled doing 
at the house: 
- I repaired and reprogrammed the generator change 
over. 
- I replaced the distribution board for the swimming 
pool.   
- Replaced the outside stair lights leading to the 
house.   
- Repaired the electric fence, called out to repair air 
10 
conditioner system one night.   
- Called out to repair the generator one night. 
- And replaced and rewired some of the water 
features. 
I would estimate that I went to the site to perform 
work there on approximately ten occasions.   
I have searched for and located certain quotations 
and invoices for work performed the invoices.  And 
then...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think you can just read that as well 
20 
because there is some significance because he gives details 
of what work was done. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He gives the prices as well. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  The first invoice is...[intervenes]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 33 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he gives dates...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...for when the work was done. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes, the first invoice, he has... three is 
quoted 
as... 
3232UE 
and 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
9t h of October 2014 and the invoice quotation made to “cash 
– Ricard”.  And then type of work done” “inspect and rotate 
alternator” and it is R 750,00. 
 
And 
the 
second 
invoice 
is, 
323 
invoice. 
 
It 
is 
15 October 2014, “cash – Ricard; the generator is tested and 
10 
is hundred percent operational.  A separate test report will 
be made”, and it is R 750,00. 
 
And then another 323, the 10t h of October 2014, “cash – 
Ricard; replace pool DB at R 2 999,23”. 
 
The next invoice is 323 and 15 October 2014, “cash – 
Ricard; replace pool DB and it is R 2 741,89”. 
 
And then the next invoice is 161 repairs to lightning”.  
Then refer and then “labour, normal time, Blouberg” and it is 
R 6 609,00. 
 
And then 
another invoice 1 and 
5, 
3rd May 2015, 
20 
Blouberg Street “the extra lights at Blouberg”.  It is 
R 1 044,70. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And he makes...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...just noting here, the boardroom there of 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 34 of 90 
 
the ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He makes... and he makes a note, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It is a document state on my system as 
Q324QUE and 241 invoice.  However, the documents 
referred to 323QUE and 323 Invoice which appeared to be 
have been admitted in error. 
 
He goes on to say: 
“Copies 
of 
these 
quotations 
and 
invoices 
are 
attached hereto as Annexures RB3.  And it must be 
10 
noted that certain of these may not have been the 
final documents sent out to Mr le Roux. 
With regards to invoice dated 15 October 2014, in the 
table above, where it is stated “generator has been 
tested and is hundred percent operational”, I also 
managed to locate a copy of the generator test report 
which is attached hereto as Annexure RVB4. 
The generator test report reflects the address as 
being... (and then gives the address) and the date of 
inspection, 10/15/2014...” 
20 
 
Chair, I think there is the American system of putting the 
month before the date.  I think it is the 15 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Oh, yes.  Okay.  Yes.  We can say 
that the address that he gives there of the house is the 
...[intervenes]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 35 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Is the house... that was...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...is the address that you visited. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, to complete his affidavit.  He says: 
“I performed services for Bosasa under Mr le Roux 
for approximately May 2014 to 2018. 
Over these years, I estimate that I performed 
services at approximately four sites. 
I recall that I performed work at Mr Gavin Watson’s 
10 
house, where I replaced certain plug points. 
Mr Watson arrived whilst I was on site and he 
introduced himself to me. 
I no longer have the business and ever since 
immigrated.   
I do not have documentation reflecting the detail of 
all the work I performed and I cannot remember every 
job I performed.” 
 
It is a sworn statement.  Chair, here the... my junior has 
referred me to... there is an issue that he raised of the name 
20 
of the business.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it not...[intervenes]   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  He... on 3.2 of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 3.2? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  3.2.   
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 36 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  On page 38, it is Sanimo Electrical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes.  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I apologise, Chair.  I also had read it but 
with the blood ringing in my ears and in my eyes, I could not 
recall where the name and where I had found it in the 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Um...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, can I beg leave to have 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking for RB... RVB4.  Where is 
RVB4? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot see an annexure marked RVB4. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Let me just... Chair, can I also explain 
what the problem also may... we have is... Chair, you will 
20 
note... just bear with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just bear one minute with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will see at page 43 the Commissioner 
of Oaths says this is the document marked A referred to in 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 37 of 90 
 
the affidavit of Renier van Biljon but I do not remember 
that... 
MECHANICAL INTERRUPTION 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...what the Australian... the New 
Zealanders did Chair is, they did not give the annexures the 
number that is in the affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  For as all the invoices instead of RV, 
they gave them numbers A, B, C, D, E, F, G.  And then... but 
if the statement that he has signed... the statement that he 
10 
has signed maintains the numbers that he had given but 
these were then...  the Commissioner of Oaths then gave 
them different numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Can 
you 
arrange 
that 
we 
get 
supplementary affidavit from him that clarifies the position to 
say the document marked so and so by the Commissioner of 
Oaths is actually the document I referred to as so and so in 
my affidavit? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Actually, Chair I would also 
arrange... we must also see if he can get to the same 
20 
Commissioner of Oaths who can confirm the document.  And 
then Chair, can I take you to T14, CR34... 37, I beg your 
pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  [No audible reply]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 38 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There, Chair, you will see this is the test, 
the generator test report that he refers to but it is left out in 
the affidavit.  Perhaps the supplementary affidavit, we will 
deal with that as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I just want to make sure that 
there is consistency between what the affidavit says and 
what the annexures are marked. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what they are marked as because if the 
10 
affidavit says a certain document is marked RB... RVB4 and 
you go to the annexures and you do not find RVB4, you are 
entitled to think there is no RVB4 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I take your... I take your point, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we just need to make sure that that is 
sorted out. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I take your point, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Then with your leave, can the statement 
and the... the statement and then the affidavit be admitted as 
20 
Exhibits T14 and T15?   
 
And then Chair, let the record then also reflects that an 
additional affidavit is sought to align the... what is the said in 
the affidavit with the exhibits that the witness is referring to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we have already admitted them, 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 39 of 90 
 
Exhibit D14 and Exhibit D15.  I think or have we not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, I think...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  We have marked Exhibit T15. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, you did make a ruling to that 
effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  But it is for completeness sake, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair, then the witness can... can I 
request that the witness be sworn in? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Before we... 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes, 
please 
administer 
the 
oath 
affirmation.  I see the lighting is taking long to arrive.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Apparently Chair, it will be set up during 
tea-time.  Unless the Chair would want us to adjourn now?  It 
is eleven o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, if it is ready, we could adjourn now 
so that it is sorted out if they are here and it is ready. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then we can come back at quarter... 
20 
come back at quarter...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  At quarter past...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:  At quarter past eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They want to tell you something. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, then... I am advised that the best is 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 40 of 90 
 
to proceed as we are proceeding...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...so that they can take the fifteen 
minutes between now and tea adjournment...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  ...to set themselves up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Okay administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR LE ROUX:  Charl Jacques Le Roux. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR LE ROUX:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR LE ROUX:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
20 
MR LE ROUX:  Yes.  And so help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHARL JACQUES LE ROUX:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, you may be seated. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr le Roux, is it correct you were 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 41 of 90 
 
contacted by the investigators of the Commission?  The 
investigator of the Commission at some stage talked to 
you? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As a result of the interview, you made 
a statement. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you have the statement in front of 
you? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, I do. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, the statement is T13.  It is 
EXHIBIT T13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it has been admitted already, his 
affidavit.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you then go through and read the 
statement for the Commission? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, he must not read the statement, 
ask him to tell the story.  I think he was employed by his 
cousin or somebody, Mr van Biljon.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr van Biljon (indistinct – recording 
20 
distorted) background or how did you get to be involved in 
this? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, I worked for …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr le Roux, he will ask you questions 
most of the time but when you give an answer, face me? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 42 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  You were – were you 
employed at some stage by a company that was owned by 
Mr van Biljon? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the name of the company? 
MR LE ROUX:   SAN Electrical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   SAN Electrical? 
MR LE ROUX:   Electrical, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He gives in his affidavit a full name for, 
10 
SAN, is Samina or something? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, that is it, we just used the 
shorter version, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  From when up to when were you 
employed by that company? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was from mid-2014 until last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Until last year? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, middle of last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  What was your position in his 
company? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   I was learning to become an electrician? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you a qualified electrician? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you know - you are able to do 
some electrical work? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 43 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that is what you were assisting 
him with. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, take it from there, Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then did you then do some work 
on then the instructions of Mr van Biljon? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And as you must have heard during the 
interaction with the Chairperson that we want to stay away 
10 
from giving the full addresses of the work you did.  Is it 
correct that yesterday, you together with the investigators, 
the legal team for the Commission and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Notshe, before you come 
to yesterday, I would like to hear him talk about what he 
did at the address that you  - we are not mentioning at that 
time before you come to yesterday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No, Chair, with your leave, I just 
wanted him to confirm he went to a place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Where he did some work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then we go back to… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay, okay, that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You visited a house in Krugersdorp. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 44 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And that house you visited, did you do 
any work on the house? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, we did some work. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you tell the Chairperson about the 
work you did? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, I can.  We fixed some lights 
there, outside lights on the staircase and the water feature 
and the power system would not – the backup power 
system would not start and we fixed that as well. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And what was wrong with the – with 
what you had fixed, what you were fixing?  If you went 
there, what did you find wrong with the issues that you 
fixed? 
MR LE ROUX:   Automatic changeover would not work on 
the backup system and we fixed that and then the outside 
lights, it was not working, any of them, so we took them 
out and put new ones in. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now can you just tell the Commission, 
when you went there for the first time did you make any 
20 
observations when you entered the house, the premises? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes.  There was – I could see on that 
high fencing there and there was guardhouse there with a 
man there that opened for us when we came there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now just stop there.  The guardhouse, 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 45 of 90 
 
when you entered the premises, on which side is the 
guardhouse? 
MR LE ROUX:   On the left side. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  You entered the premises, was 
there any other thing you noticed? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, when we worked there, I noticed 
there was an expensive car there, an Aston Martin. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry, I did not get that? 
MR LE ROUX:   I noticed there was an expensive car 
there, an Aston Martin. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is that then the name of the car? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, Aston Martin. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Where was the car? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was in the middle garage door. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Was it standing there on its own and 
how was it standing there?  How was it parked there? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was covered with a special car cover so  
I just looked at it and looked because I like cars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you go to that house once or more 
than once prior to yesterday? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   I am not sure, it was many times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Now, as far as possible I 
want you to tell me – give me your evidence from your 
recollection but your statement, your affidavit is there in 
case you want to refresh your memory.  Are you able to 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 46 of 90 
 
remember what you went to do on the first occasion you 
went there? 
MR LE ROUX:   On the first time we just …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can look at your affidavit to 
refresh your memory and Mr Notshe can assist you in 
terms of where that – in which paragraph that is dealt with, 
if necessary.   
MR LE ROUX:  If you look at …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So want you to tell me on the first 
occasion I went there, this is what was wrong, I had been 
10 
instructed to do a, b, c, d.  I went there, I did it or I did not 
do it, for whatever reason.  On the next occasion again – 
you might not need to deal with all of them but at least 
some of them. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, I can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, the first morning I met there with Mr 
le Roux and then he showed us that the backup power 
system does not work.  So we then had a look at it but then 
I left and Mr van Biljon, he went back and he fixed it. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you -do you remember when, what 
year, what month, what date was that? 
MR LE ROUX:   I am not hundred percent sure. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would you remember the year?  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 47 of 90 
 
Would you remember the year, even if you do not 
remember the month or the date? 
MR LE ROUX:   2014, it was just when I started working, 
about, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then on another occasion - you 
say you left then, Mr Biljon went back and then? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, then I went there the next time, they 
said the outside lights on the walkway to the house does 
not work.  It was the lights on the staircase and the lights 
10 
were – or they were no longer working, so we took them 
out and put new lights in. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In the house or outside the house? 
MR LE ROUX:   Outside the house. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  What year was this?  Do you 
remember? 
MR LE ROUX:   Also, that same year. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then, the next occasion? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was in that same week we were there to 
fix the – there is the small water feature there, it was not 
20 
working.  We pumped out all the water so we could put a 
new pump in there and then – and there was lights on the 
outside entertainment area that we fixed, down lights in the 
ceiling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now before you talk about the third 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 48 of 90 
 
occasion or one of the occasions, another one of the 
occasions when you went there, can you just go back to 
describing some of the features of the premises at that 
house or at that address that you had seen and you had 
included in your affidavit?   
So I am leaving out what you may have seen 
yesterday, Mr Notshe will come to that in due course.  
What you did recall before yesterday, when you deposed to 
your affidavit to say this is what you remembered about the 
house.  Did you remember about the – did you remember 
10 
the guardhouse? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, guardhouse, there was one guard 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LE ROUX:   He was always there, he opened for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was it the same person?  When you 
went there was it the same guy? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  I am going to jump to 
yesterday just for now.  Did you find the same person 
20 
yesterday or it was different? 
MR LE ROUX:   I do not remember because it has been 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It has been a long time, okay.  So 
you do not know whether it was the same guy or not. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 49 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR LE ROUX:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the guardhouse, where in relation to 
the gate is the guardhouse, as you remember it from that 
time, leaving out the fact that you say it yesterday? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is – when you walk into the main gate it 
is on the left-hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is on the left hand side. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What other features of the house did you 
remember before yesterday which you included in your 
affidavit? 
MR LE ROUX:   I just know it was a big house and a pool 
was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LE ROUX:   And the generator that we worked on, it 
was behind the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was behind the house. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The generator. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes  and it had a small board that switches 
it on and off, it was inside next to an open garage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And one of the occasions your 
affidavit says you were working there and you were in the 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 50 of 90 
 
garage and you saw something.  Tell me about that? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, I worked there then I saw what looked 
like to be an expensive car and then I looked and I saw it 
was an Aston Martin standing there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and what was the colour of the 
Aston Martin that you saw on that day, 2015 or 2014? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was long – it was too long ago to 
remember exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR LE ROUX:   But I know that it is white, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, in your affidavit you say it 
was dark or dark blue or black. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct?  That is what you say in 
your affidavit. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that remind you of how it looked 
like?  What the colour was? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Notshe, take it from 
20 
there. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, I see the time is quarter past 
eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Yes, let us take this – will the 
ordinary 15 minutes be enough?  Or if it is not enough, I 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 51 of 90 
 
will be told.  So we will adjourn until half past eleven but if 
they are not done sorting out the light then I will be told. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We will send a message. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we adjourn. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr le Roux, you are just reminded you 
are still under oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are still under oath, Mr le Roux.  
10 
Will the personnel of the Commission try and arrange a 
light that can put here on the desk?  I did ask that this be 
done some time back.  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, Mr le Roux, you were telling the 
Commission about – that you went in and you saw a motor 
vehicle in the garage.  What is the colour of the – do you 
remember the colour of the motor vehicle you saw? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, I am really – I am told it was dark and 
that it was a long, long time ago, so I was not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in your affidavit which was deposed 
20 
to on the 17 March 2020 you gave the colour of the motor 
vehicle as I think that blue or black. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did you remember the colour then?  
How did you remember the colour in March but you seem to 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 52 of 90 
 
have difficulty telling us the colour now. 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, it was – I mean because yesterday 
I had a look on the car and I saw that it was in fact white. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yesterday I did have a look at the car and 
I saw that it was white and that in March my memory – I 
told you that it was either dark blue or black. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say that when you saw it 
yesterday that it was white? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was not blue or dark blue? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or black? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Okay, but – so you see in March 
your recollection was that you had seen an Aston Martin in 
the garage of the residence and that it was dark blue or 
black. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what your recollection was? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say yesterday you saw an Aston 
Martin at the residence concerned but the colour was 
white? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 53 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Notshe, do you want to take it 
from there? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And that make of the car was it that 
you saw yesterday? 
MR LE ROUX:   Aston Martin. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay.  Now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, when you saw a white Aston 
Martin yesterday did you recall that the Aston Martin you 
had seen in 2014 or 2015 at the same residence was white 
or you assumed that it was white and was the same car? 
10 
MR LE ROUX:   It might be a newer version of that same 
model, I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now dark blue or black car is quite 
different from a white car, those colours are very different.  
How does it come about that …[intervenes] 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your recollection in March was that the 
car you had seen was dark blue or black but now you – 
now that you have seen a white one, you do not seem to be 
confident whether the one you had seen was dark blue or 
20 
black. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How does it come about - I would have 
thought that if something was white or if the car that you 
had seen was white or was black it would be quite easy to 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 54 of 90 
 
remember that you had not seen a white car, you had seen 
a black car or blue car rather than not being sure. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, they had many cars at that house 
that was dark so my memory just said that it had to be dark 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would that be anything that you 
noticed that convinced you that the car you saw yesterday 
was the same car you say in 2014 or 2015 or could it be 
that the car you saw yesterday is a different car from the 
one that you saw in 2014 or 2015? 
10 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, it might be a different car, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure. 
MR LE ROUX:   I am not sure, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But what you are sure about is that 
the car you had seen was an Aston Martin. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, that I am sure of. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Just on that, Mr le Roux, how long – 
how much time did you have and how long did it take you 
to look at the car, did you open the cover, spend time 
20 
looking at it or u just lifted the enclosed car, the cover? 
MR LE ROUX:   I just lifted it and looked at it and closed it 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And at the time – sorry, Chair, it is – 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 55 of 90 
 
Chair, I must just apologise because of the distance now 
and again I have to run back and forth and I apologise for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I understand yes, because of 
the social distancing. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I understand.  It is okay, it is okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is good for exercising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She might not like your suggestion that 
she needs exercise. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is the – the issue I was with, Mr 
le Roux, is you say you just lifted this and then closed it 
again. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now, tell me, when you went 
there, when you looked at the car, did you look at it with 
the purpose of observing it so that you can report about 
the colour of the car and the cover, you were just looking 
at it for interest sake? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, I just looked out of interest to see 
20 
what is underneath the cover, that is all. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now this other point you raised 
in your statement; how did you get to the premises?  How 
did you get to the premises?  When you get to the 
premises, outside the premises, how do you get in? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 56 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   There is a man that works there in the 
guard room, he opens for us. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   How do you communicate with him to 
open for you? 
MR LE ROUX:   I just hoot. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  And then he would open? 
MR LE ROUX:   Then he would open, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In the time that you were there did he 
ask you why you were there, what you would do, what you 
were looking for? 
10 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, nothing, he just let us in and we 
would do what …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   You would hoot and they would open 
for you. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you go in and do the work. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Okay.  Tell me, the van you were 
driving from SAN Electrical did it have a marking on the 
side to show where it was from? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   No markings, no. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So you did not identify yourself to the 
person at the gate? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Excuse me, a guard at the gate is 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 57 of 90 
 
supposed to only allow family members in and if it is 
people who are not family members you would have – or if 
you would have to check that the person is authorised to 
come into the premises, I think.  How could the guard – do 
you know why the guard would just open for you without 
asking you questions? 
MR LE ROUX:   I think that he recognised my car and he 
opened for us because he had seen us there in the past 
working. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, I cannot hear that.  Would you 
10 
please just repeat what you said? 
MR LE ROUX:   I think he would open for us because he 
would recognise my car as I had worked there on other 
days when he was there as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about the first occasion you 
went there.  Did you go there alone? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, I went there and then Richard was 
there as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Richard le Roux? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he arrive at the premises first so 
that when you arrived, he was already inside? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How did – what happened before you 
entered, did you hoot on that day, did you not hoot or what 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 58 of 90 
 
happened?  Tell me about that. 
MR LE ROUX:   No, no, it was open and then I saw him 
standing inside of the main gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Richard le Roux was standing on the 
inside of the gate? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was – so he would have spoken to 
the guard to say he must let you in. 
MR LE ROUX:   I can get in, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say as you approached the gate 
10 
the gate was already open or it opened as you were 
approaching? 
MR LE ROUX:   It was open, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but Mr le Roux was there and the 
guard was there. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you just went in. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Now on the subsequent occasion 
when you came after that without Mr le Roux being there – 
20 
because I take it there were occasions when you came 
without Mr le Roux, is that right? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, there was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you remember whether the first 
or second occasion you went to the premises Mr le Roux 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 59 of 90 
 
was there or not? 
MR LE ROUX:   No, I am not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you cannot remember? 
MR LE ROUX:   I am not sure, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but when you came after that first 
occasion without Mr le Roux being there, did the guards 
just open to you after identifying your car? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you always go there in the same 
car? 
10 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Notshe? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now, Mr le Roux, 
can you also deal with something here.  On T13  page 205, 
that is the statement, paragraph 16, you say, I am reading 
from your statement …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where? 
ADV 
NOTSHE 
SC: 
 
 
On 
T13, 
CR05, 
Chairperson, 
paragraph 16 of the witness’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   His affidavit, paragraph 16.  Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   His affidavit.  You say there: 
“On an occasion during 2017 or 2018 I was again 
contacted, Mr van Biljon, to go to premises situated 
in Blouberg Street where I was to meet Mr le Roux.” 
Now during this evidence this morning, you said you first 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 60 of 90 
 
went there in 2014.  Can you explain this? 
MR LE ROUX:   Unless it is just – it might have been after 
the initial visit for some extra work. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR LE ROUX:   In my affidavit it was after we went there 
for the first time. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So, the first time was 2014? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And thereafter you went in 2017 and 
2018? 
10 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now whilst we are on your affidavit, so 
you – or before we go there, is it correct that after you 
have spoken to the investigators you were then shown 
some pictures, photos.  You were shown some photos. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can you turn to page 12 of your – it is 
called CR2 and it is on page 12, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There is a picture there of – you were 
20 
shown the picture? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, I was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chairperson, can I just pause there 
just to explain this.  These were taken by and shown to the 
witness by Mr Groenewald.  We have his statement and he 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 61 of 90 
 
is also physically indisposed but this witness I would want 
to discuss Mr Groenewald’s statement with him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Right. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Tell, me what is depicted in the picture 
on the photo?   
MR LE ROUX:   It is the house that we worked at. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see.  Now on the photo we see -  
CR12 – we see something like there is something like  a 
gate, what – is the wooden that, can you see? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, on the left hand there. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you see a roof as you look at 
it, where the gates, what roof is that? 
MR LE ROUX:   On that roof behind the gate is the guard 
room. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now if you go to – can you go to 
CR14, what is depicted on that picture? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is also that gate at that guard room. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   In the…? 
MR LE ROUX:   The guard room. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The guard room? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   And the gate, yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Notshe, why does it look 
like these annexures are not marked?  You see there is a – 
I see that is annexure CLR2 but it is much better if on the 
actual photograph there is also – it is marked otherwise 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 62 of 90 
 
while you are looking at the paragraph and you say by the 
way which annexure is this, then you go to…[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …need to go back a few pages.  Okay, 
but it is annexure CLR2 and annexure CLR3. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but you are dealing with CLR2, is 
that right? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I am dealing again with CRL2 and then 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You went to …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I moved to CRL3 now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   My children will be proud of me, I 
pronounced three as they always correct, me not tree, I 
have managed to pronounce it properly, three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think there are many people who 
pronounce three differently.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is the point that was made 
20 
with reference to CRL2?  With the gate? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, is the gate and the guardhouse, 
the roof of the guardhouse.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, now Mr le Roux, did you say that 
before deposing to your affidavit in March you were shown 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 63 of 90 
 
this picture? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say the roof that one can see 
above the wall, the perimeter wall is the guardhouse. 
MR LE ROUX:   It is, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in your affidavit as well as in the 
affidavit of Mr Agrizzi, if I remember correctly, both of you 
say that the guardhouse is to the left of the gate, is it not? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That does not look me to be to the left of 
10 
the gate. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, if I may …[intervenes] 
MR LE ROUX:   It is the angle that the picture was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, but do you agree with me that 
when you look at the structure that you say is the 
guardhouse, that does not look to be to the left of the gate 
or are you saying that it is on the left to the gate or are 
you saying it is on the left to the gate? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is on the left, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, can Mr le Roux take the 
20 
Chairperson to CLR3? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I have the same problem on CRL3.   
As I see it, it seems to me that the main gate that the 
guardhouse is directly – if you get into the gate you would 
go – and you did not turn right or left with the car, you 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 64 of 90 
 
would go hit the structure and that would it not be left of 
the …[intervenes] 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, I think the photographer 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It did not come out clearly as – can I 
clarify that with the witness, the next step about the visit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The witness will confirm and I do not 
want to testify from the bar, but …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine.  You can ask 
him questions which will clarify this, if possible. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, this thing becomes important.  
I hope that the agreement that was signed also indicates 
which side of the gate the guardhouse is because it is 
important. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Mr le Roux, it is your CLR3, the 
pictures. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, sir. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And you were present yesterday when 
you went to the house. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, I was. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now in relation to the gate when you 
enter, in relation to the person entering the premises, 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 65 of 90 
 
where  on which side will be the – was the guardhouse 
yesterday? 
MR LE ROUX:   On the left. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And whilst we are on that, can I take 
you, Chair, to CLR – I think now we should call this T16.  
We have got …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   EXHIBIT T...? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   We have got T13, T14, T15 and then 
should be T16.  That will be …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   T15, that is Mr Renier van Biljon. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T15 is Mr van Biljon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Then can we take it to T16? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think we have T16. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   If we take it as T14 and it was marked 
– it was marked as CLR T13, CLRL15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what I am saying is I do not think 
there is one that we have admitted and marked as T16. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so what is the document you want 
20 
me to go to? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It is called the memo on inspection in 
loco Charl le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is it? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is on CLR15. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 66 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   One five? 
MR LE ROUX:   One five.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is the Chairperson with me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, this is confusing.  Okay, ja, I 
have got the memo on page 15.  Yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now, Mr le Roux, are you on there? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want us to admit this memo? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   This memo as EXHIBIT T16 and this, 
10 
Chairperson, is handed up by agreement between the 
parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should not be T – if it is here at the 
beginning maybe we should make it what, EXHIBIT T12?  
Is 
there 
EXHIBIT 
T12 
in 
another 
work 
stream 
or 
something? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the memo should come at the 
end, the agreement of what was seen yesterday but if you 
already have put it here in the front... 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chairperson, we can change that, in 
terms of slotting it in.  If the Chair, with your permission, 
you can allow us to call it T16 and then it can be arranged 
that it is at the end of Mr Charl le Roux’s evidence.  
Chairperson, there is a T12 which is the affidavit of 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 67 of 90 
 
Richard le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you suggest that we admit it as 
EXHIBIT what? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T16. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   T one six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   EXHIBIT T one six. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will write EXHIBIT T16 at page 15 at 
the top.  Okay, yes, so the memo on the inspection in loco 
10 
will be admitted as EXHIBIT T16. 
MEMO ON INSPECTION IN LOCO CHARL LE ROUX 
HANDED IN AS T16 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As it pleases you, Chair.  Chair, the 
agreement was that I would read this into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   But with your leave I will read it and 
then but in conjunction of the evidence of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you may – you can just read the 
whole of the memo. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the witness can then just 
confirm because it is agreed, it is something that has been 
agreed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Mr le Roux, I am going to - do 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 68 of 90 
 
you have the memorandum of …[intervenes] 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes, I have it. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Listen carefully, I am going to read it 
into the record.  Just listen carefully and then – so that you 
confirm or correct whatever you want to correct. 
MR LE ROUX:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Now the memorandum I am reading 
relate to: 
“The pointing out/inspection in loco by Charl le 
Roux.  Individuals present, the witness Charl Le 
10 
Roux, the Commissioner staff Adv Viwe Notshe, Mr 
Alan Nixon, Mr Tshepo Maleko, Ms Refiloe Molefe 
and then for Mrs Mokonyane, representatives is Adv 
L Hodes and Mr G Madlanga. 
1. Pointed by witness is a high fence and a 
guardhouse to the left side at the entrance and 
the photographs obtained as annexures A.”’ 
Chair, that photograph A is on page – it will be on page  
16.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then: 
“2. 
Generators situated behind the garage in a 
cage where the wires fed through the wall 
into the garage where they were connected 
to the control panel.” 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 69 of 90 
 
And that photograph of the generator is on B which is 16.6, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And over the page it is: 
“Lights fitted on the...” 
 Chair, the panel referred to, you will see the panel 
referred to on paragraph 3 as B, it – also it goes over the 
page to 16.7, is the panel.  And then over the page of the 
memorandum, Chair, it is: 
“Lights fitted the side of the walls the either sides 
10 
of the stairs that was replaced.” 
And on 16.9, those were the lights and 16.10 is the 
staircase.  And then for …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, can I take you 
back, I think you – what is that 16.6?  Is that the 
generator? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair, just bear with me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you have left me behind. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   16.6 is the generator. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then it is connected with16.7, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes.  Chair, if you were to go back, 
Chair, to 16.6 you will see next to the generator there are 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 70 of 90 
 
wires which go to into the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And the witness was saying those 
wires would then connect to 16.7, the panel on 16.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then 16.9 are the lights that were 
repaired on the staircase and 16.10 is the same staircase 
where the lights were repaired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then at paragraph on 16.1 is 
10 
repairs on the fountain situated in the corner, the witness 
stated I recall that we had to fit a small pump to the 
fountain in order to pump the water out and I think I 
repaired some lights at it or in the fountain. That will be 
found at 16.12. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair can you ignore the colour of the 
water and the – its condition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then paragraph 5 garage or where 
20 
Austin Martin valet covered, where the trampoline was 
parked and 16.14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then 6 is other features, other 
features just identified or pointed out whilst we were there, 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 71 of 90 
 
it is the lights in the covered patio were not covered when 
the work was done.  The witness whilst we were there 
Chairperson, he pointed out lights in the patio and the 
lights were, he says but the patio at that stage was not 
covered, whereas when we were there it was covered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, Chair you will notice also, I didn’t 
you to this, at 16.15 there is the lifted cover of the car 
showing the Austin Martin emblem, by agreement the 
registration was redacted, it has a registration but we 
10 
agreed for security reasons that we will take it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Le Roux you heard me reading 
through all this, is this correct, is this what happened when 
we were there? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes it is. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then is it in line with the affidavit 
and the evidence you gave today? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chairperson that is the evidence of Mr 
20 
Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what is at page 16.17?   Is that a 
certain line or an X. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Sorry Chair I will get there.  16.7 it is 
what is written, it is a manuscript note of the additional 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 72 of 90 
 
observation where he says on paragraph, in paragraph 6 of 
the memo he says – Chair just bear with me.  Chair it is 
just I can’t read the – there is a word I can’t read, oh it is 
ceiling.  It is the ceiling light in the covered patio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Which was not covered when the work 
was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then you will see that is the – that 
and on 16.8 again it is the ceiling, the lights on the ceiling. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.   Yes continue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Mr Le Roux do you confirm the 
contents of your statement? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the road if somebody is standing 
on the road next to this particular residence or is passing 
would they be able to tell whether the guardhouse is to the 
left of the gate?  So somebody who has never gone into 
the premises can they tell? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes they can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see from outside? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That it is to the left of the gate? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes you can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, would you know it is a guardhouse, 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 73 of 90 
 
would somebody know that it is a guardhouse? 
MR LE ROUX:   I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, there is nothing that can tell you 
from outside? 
MR LE ROUX:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now Mr Agrizzi described some of 
the features in his affidavit of the house.  One, he said that 
the guardhouse is to the left of the gate, which is the same 
thing that you have said as well but he mentioned other 
features that I want to see whether you are able, whether 
10 
you did notice those features.   Mr Agrizzi says in his 
affidavit deposed to on the 15 t h of November 2019 in which 
he was responding I think to the affidavit – oh no I think he 
was dealing with questions that had been posed by me 
during the hearing about features of the house as he 
recalled them.   
 
He says in paragraph 41 or in 5: 
“I am in a position to identify the premises. When I 
first visited together with the late Gavin Watson the 
guardhouse was a wood structure on the left as you 
20 
entered the premises.  This was later renovated into 
a permanent structure as well.” 
When you went to the premises was the structure a wooden 
structure or was it already a guardhouse as you saw it 
yesterday? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 74 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   It was built like it was yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was as it was yesterday? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you went there for the first time it 
was not a wood structure.   
MR LE ROUX:    No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then he says further there are 
two garages and adjacent to the two garages is a 
generator room 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that something you did see previously 
and, in the house, or maybe also yesterday? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are two garages? 
MR LE ROUX:   I think there is more than – there’s three 
garages there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are three garages, not two? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and he says adjacent to the two 
garages 
is 
a 
generator 
room 
with 
an 
auto 
switch 
20 
mechanism. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which the Bosasa contractors applied, 
the generator was on the outside. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 75 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to confirm whether his – 
what he is saying is true or not? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is true? 
MR LE ROUX:   It is true ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and you must tell me whether you 
know this or you don’t know this, he says in paragraph 
41.6: 
“In order to enter the house, there are a few steps 
and the first room on the right upon entering is Mr 
10 
Mokonyane’s, which is adorned with ANC regalia 
and heads from Lesotho.” 
The ANC regalia and the heads from Lesotho you might or 
might not have noticed, I don’t know, but he says the first 
room, he says there are a few steps when you enter the 
house.  He says in order to enter the house there are a few 
steps and the first room on the right upon entering is Ms 
Mokonyane’s study.  Do you know anything about the steps 
that are there, the few steps that you have to use to get to 
the house, into the house? 
20 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, is that where we put the lights, on 
those stairs? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And he says the first room on the 
right after you have entered the house is Ms Mokonyane’s 
study.  Now you might or might not know whether that room 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 76 of 90 
 
is a study or not, but there is a room that you see on the 
right hand side as you enter the house? 
MR LE ROUX:   I have never worked inside the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Inside, so you don’t know that part? 
MR LE ROUX:   I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I just clarify one issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Before the – Mr Le Roux just explain 
to the Chairperson about when you say there are three 
10 
garages, are they self-standing garages or are they – is it 
one big structure with doors? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes it is one with multiple doors and 
there is that one small one next to it with the general panel 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You say they are not separate 
standalone garages? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is it one garage which can take 
two cars, maybe with some divider or maybe without 
20 
divider but can take two cars or it can take three cars. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes it is one big one, it can take three 
cars. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So – but it is one garage? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 77 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it can take three cars. 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so it is not two separate garages. 
MR LE ROUX:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then can you just – Mr Le Roux 
can you just take the Commission to – Chair can I take you 
to TS16 page 16.14, where there is a car covered.  Are you 
there? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes I am there. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Is when you talk about the spaces do 
you refer to something like what we see on 16.14? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes, yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Where there is a car parked and then 
there is a pillar and then there seems to be a door next to 
the ...[intervenes]  
MR LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you will just need to go through Mr 
Agrizzi’s features that he identifies.  We know that the 
guardhouse he is confirming.  
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you will just need to see the other 
features that Mr Agrizzi identifies in one or more of his 
affidavits, see what has been confirmed by this witness, 
what has not been confirmed by this witness or what has 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 78 of 90 
 
been confirmed by the agreement between the parties and 
to the extent that there may be features that have not been 
confirmed by this witness that Mr Agrizzi talked about Mr 
Agrizzi must be interviewed to – in regard to that and to 
the extent that there may be a need for clarification 
because he talks about two garages, whether – exactly 
what he means when he says two garages, he must be 
interviewed so that he can say – explain what he means by 
two garages. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I think you can then approach 
Ms Mokonyane’s lawyers to see whether there can be any 
agreement 
whether 
the 
fixtures 
that 
have 
not 
been 
confirmed by this witness which are in Mr Agrizzi’s affidavit 
whether they are in a position to confirm them or if they do 
not confirm them there may be a need for another visit to 
confirm those because they may be important. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair as far as I can read the affidavit 
of Mr Agrizzi the only issue that the witness is able to 
confirm is the issue that the Chair has dealt with that the 
20 
staircase and the generator outside and then you touched 
on the issue of the garages.  Other than that, the witness 
is unable to because – he is unable to confirm because 
then Mr Agrizzi go to inside the house and then deal with 
the ...[intervenes]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 79 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so but look at al Agrizzi’s evidence 
because he might have dealt with some features in a 
different affidavit.  He submitted two or three affidavits.   
You don’t have to it now but you can do it later to identify 
those so that ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair in order to save our time I am 
almost done with the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Can I ask for a short adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   A short adjournment just to run 
through, I am also thinking of looking also to Mr Richard Le 
Roux’s statement to see what the witness can confirm from 
Mr Richard Le Roux in terms of the features. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well when I adjourn, I want to adjourn 
for the day. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   For the day? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we don’t have another witness.   
Well your junior might have taken note of what has been 
confirmed by the witness and what has not been confirmed 
20 
but he has confirmed what is in the agreement, he has 
confirmed I think everything that is in his affidavit.   Your 
affidavit Mr Le Roux, you have looked at it again maybe 
yesterday, recently, your affidavit that you signed in March, 
did you look at it yesterday again to refresh your memory? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 80 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, do you confirm that what you said 
there is correct? 
MR LE ROUX:   Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, with regard to the colour of the car, 
do you want to stick to the colour that you wrote as black 
or dark blue or are you saying no you think it was white or 
are you saying you are not sure what colour it was, you 
thought it was black or blue but you have seen a white 
one, you are not sure but what you are sure about is that it 
10 
an Austin Martin. 
MR LE ROUX:   An Austin Martin yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair before we leave the witness with 
your leave can I refer the Chair to you will see on page 13, 
13 point – T13, 13 page CR07 and there are two premises 
referred to there, paragraph E and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry what page? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Page 7, T13 7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seven? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Zero 07, CR07, I hope the President 
doesn’t take offence of these numberings with CR. 
CHAIRPERSON:   (laughing) yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair those residences work was done 
there but our investigations is we find it is not relevant to 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 81 of 90 
 
your enquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So I will not lead evidence on those 
residences. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair I have conferred with my junior 
we couldn’t find anything as from Agrizzi’s evidence that 
can be confirmed by this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Neither also I have got Le Roux, 
10 
Richard Le Roux, does not refer to features that can be 
confirmed by this, the only thing that Richard Le Roux is to 
confirm the house but not features. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Well the stairs inside the house 
is one of the things that Mr Agrizzi talks about in his 
affidavit.  He says there I thought he said they lead up to 
Ms Mokonyane’s study upstairs but I see in this affidavit he 
talks about the study being on the right hand side as you 
enter if I am not mistaken. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the agreement that was signed 
between yourselves and Ms Mokonyane’s affidavit does it 
deal with those or does it not? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No Judge it does not, it doesn’t but 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 82 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is one of the things that must be 
pursued with regard to Mr Agrizzi and also to check 
whether there can be agreement from Ms Mokonyane’s 
lawyers that there are such stairs inside the house. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, with the – I have been getting 
cooperation from Ms Mokonyane’s lawyers, I am sure there 
will be some discussion about that and then we will see 
what cooperation we get and then we will see what 
agreement can be reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now you know we – Mr Le Roux 
10 
here in his affidavit said the Austin Martin was dark blue or 
black but he has said that the one that he saw yesterday in 
the house is white. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair on that we will – I have got 
information as I was on my feet but I want to present it to 
you in a presentable way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, there is – I don’t know whether 
you have got here the – I don’t know whether it is attached 
20 
to 
Mr 
Groenewald’s 
affidavit 
but 
there 
is 
a 
– 
the 
investigators did approach the Department of Transport 
and they obtained the registration there and I think there 
was a colour given. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 83 of 90 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I thought that might resolve the 
issue. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you are talking about? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   That is what I am talking about and 
Chair with your leave can I deal with that issue later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It will then, it might explain the 
situation we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   The only reason I don’t want to place 
it before you, I just want to place it in a presentable 
manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And a complete picture regarding that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, then we ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   There is a NATIS registration which 
will give us the colour and other issues about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   We will have to deal with 
that as soon as possible. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No we will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Thank you Mr Le 
Roux for coming to give evidence, we appreciate that these 
are matters that happened many years ago but we are 
grateful that you came to us as the Commission. 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 84 of 90 
 
MR LE ROUX:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
if 
the 
need 
arises 
for 
the 
Commission to ask you to come back we will ask you to 
come back and the we will take it from there.   But then for 
the day we are going to adjourn or do you still have 
something? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes, I have just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we going to sit tomorrow and on 
Wednesday isn’t it? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Bosasa matters, are we still with 
that? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   What we – before we even go there 
Chair, I wanted to deal with now – can he be excused? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you are excused Mr Le Roux, you 
may go. 
MR LE ROUX:   Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair I have in the bundle an affidavit 
of Mr Lionel Groenewald, he is part of the investigation 
20 
team.  The affidavit it deals with the investigation he has 
done, the – he also deals with the evidence of the witness 
just about the picture that he saw. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I just say the investigators of the 
Commission relating to Bosasa if one of them is here they 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 85 of 90 
 
should not leave because after this I would like to see the 
legal team plus the investigators. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes we had planned a meeting with 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, after – when we adjourn, I 
would like to see the legal team and the investigator or 
investigators 
that 
deal 
with 
Bosasa 
shortly 
in 
these 
chambers here.  Okay yes? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   So Chair we are in your hands, insofar 
as the affidavit of Mr Groenewald.  It is merely to confirm 
10 
the evidence with this witness that he showed him the 
pictures that we took you through of outside the house and 
the guardhouse and he also deals with his research at 
Deeds Registry, the registration of the house and I am not 
certain whether the Chair would want him to give viva voice 
evidence or whether his affidavit can be read into the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one, it depends if there is 
something, if depends if there is something, does it deal 
with the NATIS information? 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It does not deal with the NATIS 
information, but the NATIS information is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well his affidavit can be -  I think I do 
remember; I think it will be better that he should come but I 
think you said he is not well or something? 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 86 of 90 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   He is not – he is physically 
indisposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, once he is well let’s call him it won’t 
take long. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   His evidence won’t take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And also, it will also not really help but 
it will demonstrate also the confusion that was nearly 
caused by the photograph, because in his photograph he 
took it at the right angle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   And then it will show what we saw 
yesterday and what the evidence of the witness but it will 
also bring the photograph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair for now that is all, and then 
tomorrow we had planned the evidence of one witness, 
there were two witnesses, first let me go back, initially the 
hearing was planned for three days but we felt that the 
witnesses were going to be short and we will put them 
20 
together.  So today we had planned Mr Frolick and this 
witness, tomorrow we had planned another witness and Mr 
Brian Blake for the travel agents.  It seems as if we are left 
with one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I think the other witness you can 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 87 of 90 
 
mention, was Mr Gingnana wasn’t it? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes Mr Gingnana and we are unable to 
proceed with him, we have arranged with him that he will 
get a fresh notice of the next hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so we are left with Mr Blake and 
insofar as Mr Blake is concerned, I again spoke to the 
legal representatives of Ms Mokonyane about the reference 
then they are not, they agree that his evidence can be led 
10 
despite the references. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but other people who may be 
implicated in Mr Blake’s affidavit or evidence have they 
been given 33 Notices? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   As far as I know they have been given 
but when we meet you now in chambers I will confirm that 
because what I did even on Friday I said we should go 
through all those invoices and make sure, and also the 
statement, and make sure that everyone mentioned there 
has got a 33 so that today, tomorrow when Mr Blake is 
20 
testifying people are not taken by surprise to hear their 
names mentioned when they have – but we will confirm 
with you in chambers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you see if notices haven’t been 
given then I don’t want to come here only to adjourn 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 88 of 90 
 
proceedings tomorrow. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chairperson now we are going to leave 
here that is your chambers and we will be certain whether 
they will be coming or ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I want to adjourn even tomorrow’s 
proceedings now if you don’t – if you are not ready 
because notices have not been given and Wednesday. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Well Wednesday Chair there are no 
hearings.   Can Chair just bear with me for one second. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair I am advised by my junior that 
all notices, 3.3 Notices have gone out insofar as Mr Brian 
Blake. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but going out is not enough, has 14 
days lapsed? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   No it has not lapsed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then ...[intervenes]  
ADV NOTSHE SC:   It was a short notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then if – I mean if you are going to call 
a witness without giving the implicated parties 14 days 
20 
notice there has got to be sound good reasons and I don’t 
think that there would be any good reasons with regard to 
Mr Blake. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   Chair I can confirm we have not even 
– unlike the issue of Ms Mokonyane, the witness, where we 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 89 of 90 
 
obtained consent of the other side, with Mr Blake’s one we 
have not obtained consent and we are unable to so ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so what you need to do for all 
the witnesses who will be coming check that notices have 
been issued on time, check that by the time the witness 
comes a period of 14 days will have lapsed and if you seek 
to lead the witness even though the 14 days has not lapsed 
you would need to apply for condonation, obviously there 
must be good cause.  The application for condonation I 
think I have said that in certain circumstances it doesn’t 
10 
have to be substantive, so – but I need to be told what the 
reasons are, but as far as possible the idea should be to 
make sure that we – the Commission office has the 14 days 
period. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when there are good reasons that’s 
different to lead the witness before the expiry of 14 days 
then I will listen to what the reasons are and then take it 
from there, so it is important and don’t rely completely on 
the Secretariat about the sending of notice so let them 
20 
satisfy you that it has been done, you specify if it hasn’t 
been done, it must be done by a certain date and just 
check with them because otherwise you might think that 
well I asked them to send it out by a certain date, I am 
sure they will, but you discover one day before the hearing 
06 JULY 2020 – DAY 230 
 
Page 90 of 90 
 
of that witness that actually it wasn’t sent out on time. 
 
Okay, alright, so we will not sit tomorrow, we will 
not sit on Wednesday for the purposes of the media and 
the public, I can announce that we will sit on Thursday and 
I will hear the evidence of Mr Maxatuga on Thursday. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
