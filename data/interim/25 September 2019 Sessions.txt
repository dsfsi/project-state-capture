provide confirmation where we can.

REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the

MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So help me God. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Susan. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel.  Before we start Mr Sesoko I am aware 
and you would be aware also that when Mr McBride was going to give 
evidence or when he gave evidence the commission became aware that 
in his evidence he was going to say something about a disciplinary 
hearing involving you I think which was chaired by my younger brother 
Advocate Mxolisi Zondo and that once the commission was aware of 
that it sought views from those who were – who had something to say 
about that including you whether they had any objection to me hearing 
that evidence.  Now my recollection is that you were among those who 
said you had no problem with that and if that is so I just would like to 
20 
have that confirmed.  Is that so? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I can confirm Chairperson I did indicate that 
I do not have an objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That the Chair hearing that evidence. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 4 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What we – what we did in regard to that issue 
was to say to the extent – was to say that I would not hear the – that 
evidence insofar as there are allegations made against him that is my 
younger brother until I had initiated a process in terms of which I would 
get submissions as to how I should handle that.  But it – I think 
everyone that is yourself, Mr McBride, Mr Khuba I think General Sibiya 
as well if I am not mistaken I think everybody said they had no problem 
with that.  But we – we decided that we should not necessarily decide it 
simply on the basis that those affected had no problem it might need 
more thought.  So that process that was envisaged has not happened 
10 
yet but I did see when I read your statement that unlike in the case of 
McBride’s statement where there seemed to be some suggestion of – 
some suggestion of some kind that Mr Mxolisi Zondo may have been 
used or may have been part of a scheme to get rid of certain people 
that – at least that is how I understood part of his statement , that is Mr 
McBride’s statement your statement seemed not to make any such 
suggestion but it seemed to simply state the facts that he was the 
Chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry and when the inquiry was 
supposed to happen you were – you did attend – you were in hospital 
or there was a doctor’s certificate to say you were – you were not well.  
20 
Your counsel asked for a postponement and he refused it and you went 
ahead and made – and decided the matter and as I understand your 
statement it leave everything at that.  Is my understanding correct? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chairperson that is correct.  I did not take 
the issue further than that. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 5 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Yes, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It is correct Chairperson I did not take the 
issue further than that except to show that in my view the way he acted 
showed bias. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Something that will not be expected from an 
impartial… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chairperson in a disciplinary inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  That is as far as you – that is as far as you 
10 
– you go? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sesoko it is correct that 
you have provided a statement to the commission? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And the statement that appears in the bundle 
ahead of you – in front of you from pages 1 to 20 is that your 
statement? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I beg to admit this Exhibit Y3 into 
evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the statement or 
affidavit or by Mr Matthews Sesoko will be marked Exhibit Y3. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 6 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will see Mr Sesoko when you open the file in 
front of you that it has got page numbers written in red at the top.  
When Ms Wentzel refers to pages you will see that it says MS01, 02 – 
she will just say page 1, page 2. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And leave out MS and 0 so you… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I have seen that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr Sesoko how long have you 
been employed at IPID?  It originally was the Independent Complaints 
10 
Directorate if you could just explain that to the Chair? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I have been employed by IPID formally ICD 
since the institution was established on the 1 s t April 1997.  I held 
positions from junior management, senior management – junior 
management, middle management, senior management up to executive 
management where I am currently.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And at the time that you were approached to 
investigate the Rendition Matter which we will deal with in – in due 
course what position did you hold? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Initially when the matter came to our 
20 
attention I was the Acting National Head of Investigations at IPID and I 
eventually got appointed to the position – in a permanent position as 
the National Head of Investigations at IPID. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just – I am – maybe just to refresh my memory 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 7 of 182 
 
on the structure of IPID.  You have got the director, executive director 
or IPID at the top. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have got Head – National Head of 
Investigations? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – why – what else have you got in terms of 
the structure? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Then you have other program managers 
like… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
On 
the 
same 
level 
as 
National 
Head 
of 
Investigations? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And then you have – like you have the other 
program managers, different programs.  Currently we have four 
programs in the organisations and including the CFO is also part of the 
Executive Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And then you have the Provincial Heads. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That report to me as the National Head of 
Investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So would the Head of each program have 
Provincial people – a provincial person who reports to them? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 8 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or only the National… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Only… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The National Head of Investigations? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  All the – yes all the Provincial Heads 
reports to the National Head of Investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  So – so would the National Head of 
Investigations be like the second in command or one of those who are 
immediately below the Executive Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I am one of those who are immediately 
10 
below the Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Below the – okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Director report directly to the Executive 
Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Is it correct that in the 
circumstances we are going to deal with in your evidence you were 
dismissed on the 16 t h August 2016 and then ultimately reinstated on the 
23 r d November 2016? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko could you please tell the Chair 
when you first approached to deal with the Rendition Matter to 
investigate the Rendition of the Zimbabwe Nationals by means of the 
South African Police Force back to Zimbabwe. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The matter was first brought to my attention 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 9 of 182 
 
by the then Executive Director of IPID Mr Beukman who had informed 
me that he was approached by the Minister of Police then Minister 
Nathi Mthethwa that IDIP must investigate this matter.  As – at the time 
I was the Acting National Head of Investigation requested me to put up 
a team that would investigate this matter.  And I then appointed Mr 
Innocent Khuba to lead the team that investigated this – this matter.  
Mr Beukman further advised me that we are supposed to meet with the 
Minister and the then Secretary of Police Ms Jenny Qhobosheane to 
discuss this issue and so that they can hand over the investigation to 
us.  And indeed we – we went to a meeting where such an investigation 
10 
was supposed to be handed over to us by the Minister and the 
Secretary of Police.  However when we arrived at the meeting we only 
found the Secretary of Police who then informed us that the Minister 
had said we should hold off and that when he is ready to hand over the 
investigation to us the investigation will be handed over to us.  It was 
myself, Mr Beukman and Mr Khuba who had attended that meeting.  
And that was the last time we heard about this matter.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it – sorry – was it normal for the Minister to 
request IPID to investigate certain matters? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes it is normal Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is normal? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Even though our Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Makes provision for the fact that … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 10 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The Minister may refer investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
 MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then Mr Sesoko just so we can get a – a time 
line is it correct that this occurred during October 2011? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So when did you next hear about the 
investigation? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It was about a year later.  I think it should 
have been October – around October 2012. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  When Colonel Moukangwe from Crime 
Intelligence came to my office with a docket and indicated to me that he 
had been requested by the Minister to hand over this docket to IPID so 
that it can be investigated.  By virtue of the fact that the instruction 
came to – from the Minister from what Mr – Colonel Moukangwe had 
informed me  I then took the docket to the then Acting Executive 
Director Ms Koekie Mbeki and informed her about the approach by 
20 
Colonel Moukangwe and handed over the docket to her.  I further 
informed her about the engagement earlier – a year earlier between 
myself and the former Executive Director Mr Beukman and the fact that 
at that point we were told to hold off by the Minister and that I had in 
fact appointed Mr Khuba to lead that investigation.  After I had handed 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 11 of 182 
 
over the docket to Ms Koekie Mbeki about a week later Ms Mbeki came 
back to me with the docket and indicated that I must hand over the 
docket to Mr Khuba to investigate.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what was your understanding at that stage of 
what IPID was required to investigate?  What was this rendition?  What 
– what – did you understand what exactly was being required? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  The issue of the rendition was already 
in the media around that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And I think there was also some 
10 
Parliamentary discussion about it or Parliamentary question that was 
asked of me that had to be responded to.  So we understood that the 
investigation was supposed to be around how the Zimbabwean 
Nationals were renditioned to Zimbabwe unlawful and were later 
allegedly killed in Zimbabwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is it usual for Crime Intelligence to conduct 
an investigation? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No it is not usual.  Crime Intelligence by 
nature of their work they do not conduct investigation.  They gather 
20 
intelligence and hand over the product of their intelligence to 
investigators who then conduct the investigations. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr Sesoko you have suggested in your 
statement that people at Crime Intelligence may have had a conflict of 
interest.  Could you explain that to the Chair? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 12 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Well the – the members of Crime 
Intelligence themselves were involved in the rendition or the 
allegations of rendition.  So that is why we are saying that the – they 
may have been conflicted themselves in investigating this matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then Mr Sesoko you say in your statement 
that you were told by Mr Khuba that Ms Mbeki had instructed you to 
keep the – to keep this matter away from you and to deal only with 
Colonel Moukangwe and to keep his involvement secret.  Can you just 
explain that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair.  What had happened 
10 
was that as per usual as the National Head of Investigation in an 
investigation of this nature which is a national investigation I am 
ordinarily involved in guiding that investigation and all investigators 
report to me on such investigations.   
And when I spoke to Mr Khuba about this issue trying to find 
out where – or how far he is on the investigation after the matter was 
allocated to him that is when he made me aware that he had received a 
specific instruction that I should not be involved in the investigation 
and that he should report directly to Ms Mbeki on the – on the 
investigation.   
20 
And then – which was very strange to me because that is very 
unusual because I am always involved in such investigation.  However 
because it was an instruction from my superior I advised Mr Khuba that 
he must comply with that instruction.   
I did not understand why it had to be that way and particularly 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 13 of 182 
 
because I – I had always believed that I enjoyed a good working 
relationship with Ms Mbeki.  I did not understand why such an 
instruction was given to Mr Khuba. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko did you ever meet the people who 
were involved in the investigation who Mr Khuba was working with? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct.  There was an occasion 
when Mr Khuba approached me and indicated that he is uncomfortable 
about the fact that he is the only person who deals with people involved 
in the investigation including the prosecutors from the NPA.  So he 
wanted me to know who these people were.   
10 
 
As a result of that he then arranged that I meet with them and 
then we met with them at a Petro Port Garage on the N1 and then I was 
able to meet then Advocate Musina and Advocate Moletse and Colonel 
Moukangwe was also a part of that meeting.  And basically there is not 
much that we – we discussed at that meeting except for them to 
indicate that they were happy in the way in which Mr Khuba was 
investigating the – this matter and that since his involvement in the 
investigation there has been a lot of progress in the investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  What was your next involvement 
with the investigation? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  My next involvement with the investigation 
was after Mr McBride was appointed as the Executive Director to IPID.  
Upon his appointment Mr McBride asked that we brief him on all high 
profile investigations that we were conducting.   
 
So I briefed him on the investigation for instance that I was 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 14 of 182 
 
conducting against the then National Commissioner of Police Ms Riah 
Phiyega a – General Phiyega and Khuba briefed him on the rendition 
and the other investigators briefed him on the Cato Manor investigation 
and so forth.  And after that brief we then had another meeting where 
Mr Mc Bride had indicated what Mr Khuba had informed him about what 
happened with the investigation and the difficulties he has had when he 
was investigating this matter. 
 
And he then hence forth instructed that I should be involved in 
the investigation as I should have been in the first place and that is 
when I got involved again with the investigation. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – I am sorry – Let us just get the time lines 
again?  It was around October or something in 2011 when you heard 
from Mr Beukman that there was an investigation that the Minister 
wanted to be done.  Is that right? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then more or less a year lapses without 
anything happening? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would take us to around towards the end of 
20 
2012? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  2012 that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And Mr McBride was appointed around about – 
when was it?  2012 or 2013 or you might not be able to…? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It said the 4 t h March 2014. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 15 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  March 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That was the appointment of Mr McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Now before – when Mr McBride was 
appointed Mr Khuba was already busy with the investigation, is that 
right? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khuba has begun the investigation around about 
when if you are able to remember? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As I have indicated… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  About – it was end of 2012? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Around late 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Late 2012. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I just wanted to get the time 
lines.  So – so late 2012 Mr – you – Mr Khuba gets assigned to this 
investigation and when Mr McBride is appointed in 2014 there is a 
meeting when all of you brief him on high profile matters? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  You may continue. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  If we can just go a little bit back 
in the time line just before McBride was appointed were you involved in 
taking warning statements from Generals Dramat, Sibiya and Lebeya? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I did not take the statements.  What had 
happened was that Chair Mr Khuba had approached me to say that he 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 16 of 182 
 
needed to approach the Generals Dramat, Sibiya and I think also 
General Lebeya to interview them and obtain their statements.  But he 
felt uncomfortable doing it on his own because of their seniority so he 
wanted me to facilitate that.  I informed him that because of the 
instruction he had he needed to go to the Acting Executive Director and 
get approval if he wanted my assistance in that regard.  Which Mr 
Khuba and he accordingly got approval in writing from the former Acting 
Executive Director Ms Koekie Mbeki that I can assist in facilitating that 
which I accordingly did.  I facilitated the meeting with General Dramat, 
General Sibiya and General Lebeya and even accompanied him to a 
10 
meeting with General Dramat and General Lebeya where he had 
indicated to them that he needed their statements and so forth and 
which they – they subsequently provided to him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Now once Mr McBride had 
instructed you to become involved in this investigation did you work 
with Mr Khuba to prepare a report? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And could you explain … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  What had happened… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What happened yes? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  What had happened is that upon Mr 
McBride indicating that I must get involved with the completion of the 
investigation because Mr Khuba had already indicated to us that he had 
received further evidence which he needed to include to the – in the 
docket and the docket at that point was already with the NPA and he 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 17 of 182 
 
had written to Advocate Mosing requesting the docket so that he can 
add the further investi – evidence that he had obtained. 
 
And then McBride then said we can – Mr Khuba can proceed 
and do what he had intended to do even before he was appointed.  And 
Mr Khuba proceeded to get the docket from the NPA and then after he 
received the – the docket we had met in my office to discuss the 
evidence that he had obtained – further evidence that he obtained 
including the evidence that was already there in the docket.  And we 
looked at the evidence – the totality of the evidence and what could be 
sustained for criminal prosecution and what could not be sustained.  
10 
And on the basis… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – I am sorry – let me interrupt you.  At that stage 
there was no report as such or was there a report that was – had 
already been put – given to the NPA? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As far as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you remember? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair when I – I engaged with Mr Khuba at 
that point I was not aware that there was a report that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had already been submitted? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That had already been submitted to the 
20 
NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I only became aware later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I am aware that Mr Khuba had all - always 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 18 of 182 
 
done … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Various reports? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Various progress reports … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which reports would go to also the Minister 
of Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In fact at some point he would email me a 
report.  I remember a specific report that he emailed me requesting that 
I transmit it to the Secretary of Police. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  For onward transmission to the Minister of 
Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you - you certainly are speaking about those 
interim reports - progress reports being made prior to Mr McBride 
asking you to be involved? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So - so there had been a number of 
interim reports - progress reports? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which had been sent to the NPA and had been 
forwarded to the Secretary of the Police to pass on to the Minister? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Then you - you may proceed.  I 
interrupted you when you were I think dealing with the question of the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 19 of 182 
 
two of you that is yourself and Mr Khuba looking at the docket … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Mr Khuba said he had obtained other 
evidence.  I think you can proceed from there. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  So we - we looked at then the - the 
totality of the evidence that was there.  Mr Khuba would sit on my - on 
my desk and type in the report that we were working on and then after 
we have analysed the evidence then we - we concluded the report and 
based on our analysis of the available evidence at the time we came to 
the conclusion that there was not enough evidence to come to the 
10 
conclusion that there was any misconduct or any criminality that can be 
proven on the part of General Sibiya and General Dramat and that is 
exactly what our report recommended. 
We 
did 
however recommend 
criminal 
prosecution 
and 
disciplinary action against one Colonel Maluleke who was the active 
player in the whole rendition saga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where did he belong to in terms of structures?  
Did he - did he belong to Crime Intelligence?  Did he belong to - is 
there a unit to which he belonged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Hm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one against whom you made … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Colonel Maluleke was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  He was a member of the DPCI.  The Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was a member of the Hawks? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 20 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of which General Dramat was the Head at the time? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Of which General Dramat was the Head and 
General Sibiya was the Provincial Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Gauteng? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did General Maluleke have a nickname 
10 
that you know of? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Colonel Maluleke was called Cowboy.  He 
was popular known as Cowboy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cowboy? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Cowboy yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just before we move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Otherwise what was his name - his …? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Colonel Maluleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, did he have a name.  That is the surname. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you do not know the surname? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Sorry, Chair I do not - I do not know his - 
his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 21 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I do not remember his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just knew the … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Everyone called him Cowboy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because he used - he wears a cowboy hat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So - so that is how everyone identified him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In paragraph 17 if you can just go back to that 
for a - a moment.  You say on 23 January 2014 you received an interim 
10 
report by Mr Khuba for onward transmission to the Secretariat of the 
Police.  Could you just explain that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct.  As I have indicated earlier 
Chair that that will be one of those progress reports that Mr Khuba 
used to send to the NPA and as well as the - the Secretariat.  So on 
this occasion he had emailed this report to - to me with a request that I 
must ensure that the report is submitted to the Secretary of Police for 
onward transmission to the Minister. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did you consider the report at that time? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No.  I did not consider the report.  
20 
Particularly because of the fact that I was not supposed to be involved 
in the investigation.  So when I - I received the email I had the - I - I 
printed out the report and had it sent to - to the Secretary of Police. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL: 
 
Now 
in 
paragraph 
22 
you 
say 
on 
18 March 2014 you and Mr Khuba finalised your report.  Is that correct? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 22 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then was that submitted to Mr McBride for 
his approval? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct.  This is in line with our own 
standard of vetting procedures as well as our regulation.  So once we - 
we had concluded the - the report as the - the Supervisor to Mr Khuba I 
had to quality check the report and sign off on the report and the 
Executive Director will then approve the report for submission to the 
NPA. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And who at the NPA was the report sent to? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The report was sent to the former NDPP 
Mr Nxasana.  We had in fact had a meeting prior to that with the NDPP.  
Myself and the Executive Director Mr McBride and some of the 
discussions in that meeting was surrounding this issue of the rendition 
and we assured him that once we had concluded on it then we will 
forward the report to him which we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take you back to paragraph 17 of your affidavit?  
You say: 
“On 23 January 2014 I received an interim report 
from Mr Khuba via email for onward transmission to 
20 
the Secretariat of Police.  Because of my exclusion 
from the investigation I did not consider the report.  
However I have subsequently learnt that the report 
sent to me was an amended version of the report 
which had - which had initially been sent to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 23 of 182 
 
Advocate Mosing 
recommending 
that 
both 
Generals Sibiya and Dramat be charged.  However 
after sending this - this report to Advocate Mosing I 
am informed that Mr Khuba obtained cellular phone 
evidence which excluded General Sibiya and he 
accordingly 
deleted 
his 
recommendation 
that 
General Sibiya be charged.” 
There you talk about two reports.  One you get - you talk 
about the interim report that you got - received from Mr Khuba on 
23 January but you say that report - if I understand you correctly - was 
10 
an amended version of an earlier report that Mr Khuba had sent to 
Advocate Mosing.  Is my understanding correct so far? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I became aware of the - the report that 
Mr Khuba had sent to Advocate Mosing only in January 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO: 
 
After 
the 
Minister 
had 
suspended 
General Dramat and after the - the Minister had at the time when he - 
he suspended General Dramat had indicated that it was on the basis of 
20 
the - the IPID Report and - and in January or the - the Minister had 
said that it was on the basis of the IPID Report which the Executive 
Director Mr McBride had disputed which was factually correct because 
we had not recommended any criminal charge or disciplinary charge 
against General Dramat and then in January there was then a media 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 24 of 182 
 
inquiry by a - a journalist Mzilikazi Wa Afrika to our national 
spokesperson and he then forwarded to him the last page of the report 
which showed the recommendation that Generals Dramat and Sibiya 
must be - must be prosecuted and - and that report was signed by 
Mr Khuba and that was the first time that I became aware of - of such 
report which I subsequently called Mr Khuba to account about the - the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so - but you say that was in January 2015? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  January 2015 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And here in 27 - in - in paragraph 17 you refer to 
10 
what happened in January 2014 when you received that interim report 
from Mr Khuba.  You sure that is - there is no mistake?  There was a 
year after you received that interim report before you became aware of 
that other … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  Hence I say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I - I say in the - in the statement that I later 
became aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No I understand that.  I am just wondering 
why - why you were not made aware for such a long period of - of it but 
20 
there may be an explanation.  I thought that because here in paragraph 
17 as I understand what you are saying is on 23 January you received a 
report - an interim report from Mr Khuba … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you received that interim report you say 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 25 of 182 
 
you subsequently learnt that this report that you were receiving in 
January 2014 was an amended version … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of a report that had been sent already to 
Advocate Mosing recommending that Generals Sibiya and Dramat be 
charged. 
 
When 
you 
say 
subsequently 
are 
you 
referring 
to 
January 2015? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  I am referring to January 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  When I first became aware … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That there was now this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So all this time you were not aware? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  All this time both myself and Mr McBride 
were not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you were aware that Mr Khuba had sent 
some … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Some progress reports. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reports? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were not aware of what the - the content of 
those reports at that time? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  We were not aware that there was a 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 26 of 182 
 
report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That recommended  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That General Dramat and General Sibiya 
must be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Must be charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this interim report that you were receiving from 
Mr Khuba you received from Mr Khuba in January 2014. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand from paragraph 17 that it was - it was 
saying that General Sibiya should not be charged.  Is that correct? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you do not at that stage say anything about what 
it may have said about General Dramat.  Did …? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The - the report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That report. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That report as I said subsequently we have 
learnt that report the - the interim report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Did recommend that General Dramat be 
charged … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 27 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So this … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But it excluded … 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Sibiya? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is the interim report it excluded 
General Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So - so as far as you were concerned in 
January 2014 after receiving this interim report the understanding was 
the report says General Sibiya should not be charged but as far as 
General Dramat was concerned it was saying he should be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That was what the report was saying Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what the report was saying? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but what you are saying is later in 
January 2015 you discovered that there had been another report which 
you are saying both of them should be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No thank you.  I understand now. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you and just to clarify what the Chair 
has put to you when you received the report of January - 
23 January 2014 you did not read that report? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That - that is right.  I did not engage with 
the report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So it was just for me to - to pass it over.  
So all these facts be - became clearer to me when in January these 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 28 of 182 
 
issues started being raised.  Then we - we started engaging with all 
these issues.  Then realised that actually there are these reports that 
are - are contradicting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko if we can just deal with the events 
that happened before January 2015 when you found out about this 
other report signed by Mr Khuba.  Could you explain what the reference 
group was that you refer to in paragraph 24 and what dealings you had 
10 
with this group? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  You might have dealt with 
this but I am not sure.  Oh I think you did but I - I think I was focusing 
on something else.  You did refer to paragraph 22.  Paragraph 22 
Mr Sesoko says that: 
“On 18 March 2014 you and Mr Khuba finalised a 
report which said that - which recommended that no 
charges be brought against General Dramat or 
General Sibiya as there was no credible evidence to 
support any charges against them which was sent to 
20 
Mr McBride 
and 
Mr McBride 
made 
some 
grammatical changes and after he had corrected it 
Mr Khuba and I signed the report and then 
resubmitted it to Mr McBride for his approval.” 
My question is as you were working on this report together now. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 29 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is yourself and Mr Khuba and making this 
recommendation that Generals Sibiya and Dramat should not be 
charged because there is no credible evidence.  Did Mr Khuba not 
mention to you that you know earlier on I had sent a report which said 
both of them must be charged?  Now - now I am convinced that they 
should not be charged.  Did he not mention that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No, no, no.  He did not mention that there 
was such a report that was sent to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The NPA? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To Advocate Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  However we did discuss the - the issue of 
whether there is evidence that can sustain the charging of these 
Generals.  That was part of the - of the discussions I had with 
Mr Khuba when we were evaluating the evidence and at the end we 
came to the conclusion that there was not such. 
For instance some of the issues we discussed was the issue 
of the charging of - of General Dramat and his initial view that 
General Dramat must be charged and what the basis thereof was which 
20 
in our discussion became clear that it was a basis of a witness 
statement which after he himself had engaged an expert to do an 
analysis of the statement. 
The report came with the conclusion that that statement was 
deceptive because the - the witness had - had already passed on at the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 30 of 182 
 
time.  So these are the discussions that we had and based on that we 
said but given the evidence that we have and other witness statement 
which are not sustained the charge against General Sibiya.  I mean - I 
mean General Dramat … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which conclusion we - we put in our report 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That we both signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Later on - later on - a year later or so when you 
10 
heard about this earlier recommendation that - about the report that 
had said both of them must be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it surprise you that Mr Khuba had not mentioned 
this to you when you were working on the final report and saying these 
two should not be charged?  That he did not say you know by the way I 
had made an earlier report where I had been convinced that they 
should be charged and I had recommended that they - they should be 
charged but now I think that there is further evidence and they should 
not be charged. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair indeed I was surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I - when - when we get - we got that media 
inquiry we even suspected that the - the signature of Mr Khuba … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had been forged? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 31 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Had been forged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You did not believe it? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So I immediately called Mr Khuba and said 
we have just received this thing from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The media? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The media - Sunday Times and journalist 
(indistinct).  There is a report that is signed by you saying this and 
Mr Khuba could not immediately remember that but when I - what I said 
10 
to him was that you - you need to come to - to Head Office so that we 
discuss this because it is different from what we - we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we recommended? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We have - we have recommended and I 
asked him go back to your records … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And check … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  What - what happened in this regard and 
then indeed he came to - to Head Office and when he came he had 
20 
already gone to his records and then - then he remembered what had 
happened and the circumstances surrounding the sending of that report 
to Advocate Mosing and then he explained to - to myself and - and 
McBride the circumstances surrounding this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I - I do not know but it does not seem to me like 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 32 of 182 
 
something you should forget having - having done.  I know that you 
might not be able to comment and Mr Khuba will give evidence later.  I 
am just thinking that it will be something that you could easily 
remember that yes I - I did send an earlier report where I recommended 
that they be charged but that was the only basis of the evidence that 
was available then and so on. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair from my recollection in terms of my 
discussion with Mr Khuba because he has - he has been sending a lot 
of reports to both the - the NPA and the Secretariat his progress report 
what he did not recall was that the - there was a report which he signed 
10 
where he made specifically those recommendations that both Sibiya 
and Dramat should be charged. 
So that is the - the explanation he - he gave to - to us.  In 
relation to the issue of General Dramat I mean as I said that in our 
discussion that came up and the - the issue of the recommendation that 
he be charged and which we discussed based on the further evidence 
that he has obtained and whether he can sustain a - a criminal charge 
against General Sibiya which he came to the conclusion that he could 
not. 
So - so as to how at the time he could not remember the 
20 
signed report to - to General - to Advocate Mosing.  I think Mr Khuba 
would be able to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no.  I - I understand.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko if we can go to paragraph 24 on 
page 6 of the bundle? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 33 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you just explain the reference group 
and the dealings that you had with this reference group? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair what had happened was around 
November 2014 Mr McBride called us into a meeting to say the people 
from the Ministry - reference group that was appointed to the Ministry 
that wanted to have a meeting with us.  In the meeting it was myself, 
Mr Khuba and Mr McBride and the members of the reference group. 
One of whom is Advocate Mathenjwa of the NPA.  There are 
other - there were other two or three members.  I cannot remember 
10 
their names.  There was a White lady.  I cannot remember her name 
and then in the meeting they indicated to us that they were appointed 
by the Minister of - of Police Minister Nathi Nhleko at the time. 
Nathi Nhleko at the time to look at issues within the SAPS 
and the discussion surrounded also or mainly the - the rendition 
investigation that we conducted and then we briefed them about the 
rendition investigation and how we came to the conclusion that we - we 
came to and then after that meeting I think it was a day or so later 
Mr Khuba informed me that he was called by Advocate Mathenjwa 
requesting the rendition docket to which Mr Khuba referred him to the 
20 
Executive Director Mr McBride that he must request the docket from 
Mr McBride and from what I learnt from Mr Khuba then Mr Mathenjwa 
said no I will find it by other ways and a few days later we then 
received a letter from the Minister of Police Mr Nathi Nhleko requesting 
the - the rendition docket. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 34 of 182 
 
The letter was received by the Executive Director of course.  
Then he called me into a meeting with him and informed me that he just 
received this letter from the Minister and asked for my advice.  I read 
the letter and I indicated to Mr McBride that it is not appropriate for the 
Minister to ask for a - for a docket of our investigation but however at 
the time we did not know the intentions. 
So I advised Mr McBride that maybe the Minister wants to do 
the right thing in relation to this issue.  So diplomatically let us write to 
him indicating that in fact he is not supposed to have this but we 
believe you will do the right thing with this docket and the 
10 
recommendations.  So I packaged the - the copies of docket and the 
report that we had already sent to the NPA and the letter. 
I advised on the letter with the - the Executive Director and 
we sent the letter with the - the docket to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was now around what time? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That was around November 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Long after the report that you and Mr Khuba prepared 
together had been sent to the Minister - to - to … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  NPA? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and would it also have been sent to the Police 
Secretariat or only to the NPA? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 35 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No we only sent to the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and - and he - he did not want a report or 
a progress report or anything?  He wanted the entire docket? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  He wanted the entire docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  He wanted the entire docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The letter was very clear that he wanted the 
entire docket.  In fact if my recollection serves me well they even 
miswrote the - the docket reference number there but we were aware 
10 
that they - they were referring specifically to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the rendition file? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To this docket.  We - I think it was just a - 
an error … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  When they made reference to - to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko can you explain - you make 
20 
reference to it in paragraph 27 what happened a month later in 
December 2014? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So Chair in December 2014 General Dramat 
was suspended by the Minister.  I actually saw that on the news and to 
- to our surprise the Minister has indicated that the suspension of 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 36 of 182 
 
General Dramat was on the basis of the investigation and report by 
IPID.  It took us by surprise because our recommendation did not 
recommend any action against General Dramat. 
 
Now when the Executive Director was approached by the 
media to respond to this issue then he indicated that the IPID report 
did not recommend any action against General Dramat and I think that’s 
when now the conflict between the Executive Director and the Minister 
started because that’s now when in January we were then confronted 
with this other report which Mr Kuwe had signed, which report was sent 
to Advocate Musi from what Mr Khuba told us, so as far as we were 
10 
concerned the only report that went to the minister is the report where 
we exonerated General Dramat and General Sibiya.   
 
So we don’t know how the Minister would have got this report 
from Mr Khuba except of course if he had interacted with Advocate 
Musi. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Mr Sesoko when – do you remember when 
McBride was then suspended is it correct its March 2015? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct r McBride was suspended in 
March 2015. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And who was appointed to act in his 
20 
place…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Wentzel, so General Dramat was 
suspended in December 2014? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the following month, namely January 2015 Mr 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 37 of 182 
 
McBride was also suspended? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   No in March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In March oh okay thank you, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   And upon the McBride suspension by the 
Minister, Mr Kgamanyane who was the Provincial Head for Free State 
and was reporting to me, was appointed to act ad the Executive 
Director of IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, I think you said earlier on that immediately below 
the position of Executive Director of IPID, there are a number of 
positions occupied by various people including yourself? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those would be the people, immediately below the 
Executive Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct.  In our structure we call 
them Programme Managers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Programme Managers? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that apply to you as well, the…[intervenes]. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes I’m part of the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you are part of that yes, and that’s about how 
20 
many people? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   It is four people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Four people? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so none of these people…[intervenes]. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 38 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   No actually – sorry Chair it’s five people 
including the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five people including the CFO? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So out of these five people immediately below the 
Executive Director none of them was appointed to act in the position of 
Executive Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the person who was appointed to act in the 
position of Director was he on the next level, below the level of 
10 
Programme Managers? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct, in terms of levels in the 
Public Service we are all on the same level as Chief Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   However, in terms of the structure of the 
organisation we are Executive Management as Programme Managers 
and then you then have the Provincial Heads that run the provinces and 
the delegation to me by the Executive Director was that I must 
supervise all the Provincial Heads. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, does what you have just said mean that a 
20 
Provincial Head is also at the level of Chief Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so in terms of Public Service you might all be 
on the same level, but in terms of the structure of IPID, you are not on 
the same level as a Provincial Head? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 39 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   No we are higher. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja you are higher and Provincial Heads report to 
you? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you – from that point of view, those who are on 
Programme Managers are superiors to those who are Provincial Heads? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the person who was appointed to act was at 
Provincial Head level? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
about 
five 
people 
who 
could 
have 
been…[intervenes]. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Potentially been…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja potentially been – were ignored? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.  After Mr Kgamanyane was 
appointed, what then happened? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Immediately upon his appointment as the 
Executive – acting Executive Director, Mr Kgamanyane then instructed 
20 
myself and Mr Khuba to attend to an interview with Werksmans 
Attorneys which the Minister had appointed to investigate in our 
standing – in our understanding the issues surrounding the two reports.  
What – it’s now known as the so-called first and second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of course the second report being the final one? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 40 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You and Mr Khuba put together?    
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the so-called first report being the one where Mr 
– which Mr Khuba did by himself where he recommended that both 
General Dramat and General Sibiya be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And did you attend an interview at 
Werksmans Attorneys? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes Chair I did, because it was an 
instruction from my superior and upon attending that interview which 
was led by an attorney from Werksmans Mr Sandile July I specifically 
enquired before we even started the interview  what the purpose of the 
interview is and whether, am I being investigated for any wrongdoing, 
whether it be criminal or misconduct to which Mr July and his team 
indicated that it was not the purpose of the interview, the purpose was 
simply for the Minister to understand the circumstances surrounding 
these two reports. I then agreed to participate in that interview on 
those basis. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well before you proceed Mr Sesoko, please clarify 
this for me.  The Minister had two reports, the one where we call for 
convenience, the first report, the other one being the second or final 
report and of course the one that we call the first report based on what 
you have told me, might not really have been the first report because 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 41 of 182 
 
there were a number of reports but it’s the one where Mr Khuba 
recommended that General Dramat and General Sibiya be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the Minister sent – asked you through whatever 
channels, through the Executive Director or through whoever, before 
asking a Law Firm to investigate, ask you to explain what he did not 
understand, did he ask you to explain what he did not understand which 
seems to have been one report saying General Dramat and General 
Sibiya should be charged and another one saying they should not be 
charged? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair you see exactly while you are saying 
that’s what’s surprising to us because we would have expected that the 
Minister would have approached the Executive Director as a person 
reporting directly to him to report – to explain the circumstances 
surrounding this report.  In our view, there was no need to even appoint 
a Law Firm to investigate this issue.  This was a simple operational 
issue that could have been explained properly to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is why later because of the events 
that happened it became clear to us what the intention was. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I - I mean I grappled with this quite a lot 
when Mr McBride was giving evidence and of course he was the first 
witness to deal with it other than what one has read in the media in the 
past.  I would have thought the first thing you do if people under you or 
under a structure that’s under you, if they have done something that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 42 of 182 
 
you don’t understand is first thing is ask them to explain to you and if 
their explanation is not satisfactory then maybe you can take – can 
make certain decisions.  
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair and …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I don’t understand why it was not done. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Exactly that is why we were puzzled how 
this issue was handled even the fact that the appointment of 
Werksmans and that us, as employees of IPID must …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must got to a Law Firm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Go to a Law Firm and discuss this thing, I 
10 
mean, Mr Khuba will testify about this that he was approached directly 
by, first the lawyer from the Law Firm without engaging the Department 
internally to say, we’ve been appointed we want you to come before us. 
Normally when Mr Khuba refused to cooperate with them and informed 
them I am  his supervisor and McBride is the head of the institution 
they must consult those people, that’s when we received an email from 
this attorney, Sandile July, to say, he wants to interview Mr Khuba and  
in the email Mr McBride’s email address was wrongly spelt on the email 
so Mr McBride did not receive the email, but I received the email and I 
responded to the attorney to say, look this can only be sanctioned by 
20 
Mr McBride and you have – the email that you put there is wrong, 
here’s the correct email address.  So Mr Khuba was continuously being 
pestered to get him to go and talk to these lawyers and I suspect that , 
because of the frustration that Mr Khuba is refusing to do so and said it 
must go through a proper process, departmentally and I – my view is 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 43 of 182 
 
that the Minister saw it fit that he suspend Mr McBride so that it’s easy 
then to gain access to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but also, I guess we’ll get to the report but it 
seems to be accepted by all concerned that the so-called first report 
was only signed by one person, Mr Khuba. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not sign it? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   I did not sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr McBride did not sign it, so if the two of you only 
signed the final – the second report I mean the three of you and 
10 
therefore if anybody – if there was supposed to be an explanation from 
anybody it must have been Khuba – Mr Khuba who had signed both but 
not people who signed one? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair, from our standpoint 
and after engagement with Mr Khuba we understood the circumstances.  
Remember that I’ve already indicated that I was not supposed to be 
involved but once Mr Khuba started explaining the events surrounding 
this investigation and the kind of pressures that he was put through, I 
mean, Chair every little thing, Mr Khuba received some evidence that 
seemed to suggest some wrongdoing against General Dramat and 
20 
sharing that evidence with Moukangwe and the team that he was 
working with, it will immediately be leaked to the media.  You know, so 
it was clear that there was an orchestrated effort to put General Dramat 
in a bad light.  I would want to venture to say Chair that, had our report 
found wrongdoing or if we had succumbed and manipulated the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 44 of 182 
 
evidence and the facts and made a conclusion that General Dramat 
must be charged for any wrongdoing we wouldn’t have found ourselves 
in the situation that we find ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay I think we should take the tea break at this 
stage, we are at twenty past we will take the tea break and then we’ll 
resume at twenty-five to twelve, but before we do that, Miss Wentzel 
I’m not sure but I think there was some litigation involving Mr Sesoko.  
Was there some litigation following your dismissal, was there some 
litigation, Court case? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes there were a number of litigations 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that your re-instatement was a result of 
a settlement is that right? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes through a bargaining council. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so there was no arbitration award or judgment 
that was given…[intervenes]. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   It was an arbitration award. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was an arbitration award? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it Miss Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes it is. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 45 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh because I said, I think last week, an I’m just 
going to say it again, please share this information will all members of 
the legal team, in regard to any witness where there has been a 
judgement there has been litigation that may be related to what we are 
talking about we must have that, and I must be advised in advance so 
that I can read that judgement but also it’s important to look at 
judgments because there may be findings that have already been made 
and conclusions that have been made which are not being challenged 
further by other parties which might be important that we understand as 
the particular witness is being led because those findings might be 
10 
standing so that we are all alive to it.  So I think if we get that 
arbitration award to be part of the bundle that will be important, as 
soon as possible. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I think that arbitration award is part of 
the bundle, I’ll take it to you in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay we’ll adjourn now for the tea 
break and I move that we will return at twenty to twelve.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair before the tea adjournment you were 
asking me about the judgment and the disciplinary proceedings.  I have 
misinformed you because I got confused between the disciplinary 
proceedings and the arbitration proceedings.  We have got the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 46 of 182 
 
judgment in the disciplinary proceedings not the arbitration proceedings 
but we are getting it and I am sure by lunchtime we will be able to 
provide it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine but also see if there are any other 
judgments relating to him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  About whether it is a suspension or a dismissal or 
whatever that may be relevant. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what we are looking into.  Let us get all of them. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes we will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same thing with other witnesses in regard to this 
sector and in regard to others so that we – we have a full picture. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We will do that.  Before the adjournment we 
were dealing with the interviews that you attended with Werkmans.  Is it 
correct that recorded that interview? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair I recorded the 
interview. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have a look at Annexure MS1 on 
page 22 is that the transcript of the recording? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And did Werkmans also record this interview? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair Werkmans also 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 47 of 182 
 
recorded it.  What had happened was that when before we started they 
put a recording on the table to say they are recording the interview.  I 
said it is fine but I also want to record the interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And I also put my recorder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To record the interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if you have a look at the bottom of page 
23 you will see it is reflected there: 
10 
“Mr Sesoko:  Ja I think first of all what I want to 
raise is I want to know the status of the inquiry and  
Mr Thom:  Okay.   
Mr Sesoko:  Whether I am here as a suspect in a 
criminal investigation or a disciplinary investigation 
because when I went through the terms of reference 
the Minister says you must investigate whether there 
was a misconduct or crime committed so I need to 
establish what my status is.  And 
Mr Thom:  Yes yours stated Mr Sesoko you are not a 
20 
suspect in criminal proceedings or proceedings to be 
conducted to be either conducted by the Minister or 
IPID for that matter.  This investigation is to 
understand as to what: 
Why do we have these two reports which have 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 48 of 182 
 
conflicting information and a way which have 
recommendations that are different? 
Mr Sesoko:  Okay. 
Mr Thom:  You know so our mandate is to establish 
those facts you know. 
Mr Sesoko:  Alright. 
Mr Thom:  As to why do we have the different – two 
different investigation reports. 
Mr Sesoko:  Okay. 
Mr Thom:  Yes. 
10 
Mr Sesoko:  No it is fine. 
Mr Thom:  Okay Mr Sesoko like I said before you you 
posed a question on the status and the purpose of 
the investigation.  We had consulted with Mr 
Innocent Khuba.” 
Is that a true reflection? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct because in – I asked 
specifically this because I needed to understand what is it that they 
were looking at?  And – so that if it is an investigation that has to look 
at issues of misconduct against me any criminal inquiry against me 
20 
then I can have proper legal representation to engage in that process.  
But because of the assurance that they gave me that it is not about that 
but only to understand the – how the reports came about then that was 
the only basis I participated in that process.  That is why I was taking 
aback when the report now comes and recommend that I be charged. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 49 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When you did you first learn about the 
Werkman’s Report?  You can go back to paragraph 35 of your statement 
– page 9? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The report… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Wentzel are you deliberately 
jumping to the report before finalising the discussion at the meeting 
that he had with the Werkmans team? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  We can – I will go back thank you Chair.  
What – what did you tell the Werkmans team after that about the two 
reports? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair I explained to them as my earlier 
testimony said about how the two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Came about. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Came about.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As I had earlier explained that my 
engagement with Mr Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And the fact that there was further evidence 
that was obtained by Mr Khuba. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And that was the basis on which we 
analysed the evidence with Mr Khuba and came to the conclusions as 
we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 50 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And the fact that I was not aware and if you 
go through the transcript and even their report you will realise that they 
even say in their report I refused to engage them on the – the so called 
first report that was signed by Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because I always maintained that I did not 
know about that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And therefore I cannot say anything in 
relation to that report. 
10 
Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I can only talk about the report that I had 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And that was submitted to the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And that is the report I was involved with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The other report I know nothing about it and 
I cannot engage on it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  When you said – explained all of this to them at 
the meeting what else did they want to find out from you?  One would 
have thought it became clear you knew nothing about the first report 
therefore they should not ask you anything about that and then if they 
could not ask you anything about the first report I do not see why they 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 51 of 182 
 
would be able to ask you anything about the second report because the 
second report had recommendations. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
What 
problem 
would 
they 
have 
with 
the 
recommendations in the first – the second report? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly Chair and I – the interview did not 
go any further because I got a sense that they were frustrated by the 
fact that I did not want to engage them on the first report which I did 
not know anything about.  And because they kept on harping on the 
issue of altering the report and I said to them but I cannot alter 
10 
something I do know.  Something that I have never even seen you 
know.  So because of my responses to them they just stopped the 
interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr McBride gave evidence I did try to you know 
deal with – to try and get clarification on this concept of altering in the 
report because it seemed to be central to the whole thing. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But as I understand the position now and you 
must just tell me if that is your understanding too?  There was a so 
called – there was this so called first report. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which recommended that General Dramat and 
General Sibiya be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there was the second and final report which 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 52 of 182 
 
recommended that they should not be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These two were separate reports. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Separate documents. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one standing on its own, the other standing on its 
own.  Each one having its own status.  The first one having – having a 
certain status and the final one having the status of a final report.  Am I 
– am I - is my understanding correct so far? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair and I am surprised 
that you have such an easy understanding of this thing because that is 
exactly what we have been trying to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And unfortunately when people have their 
own agendas … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That kind of explanation never flies with 
them.  And that is why the nub of the charges against us including the 
criminal charges. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Was that we have changed the report.  We 
have altered the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I mean it is – it is – it is what I – I could not 
understand because if you talk about altering a report, changing a 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 53 of 182 
 
report for me you are talking about having this document and then 
changing on the – physically on that document. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have one document which says one thing you 
have another document which says one thing you cannot be said to 
have changed that one. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be said – you may be have – you may be 
said to have made a recommendation that is different from the one 
made in the first report.  So that is fine.  And so what.   
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And Chair in our craft as investigators it is 
not unusual that you would have a – a change of opinion in your 
investigation based on the evidence you have at that point in time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  At a particular point I might have a 
particular set of evidence which when looked on its own may want me 
to come to a particular conclusion.  But at some point I can have 
further evidence which at that point may make me conclude differently. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  And we as investigators we make 
recommendations Chair.  I am a former prosecutor and as a prosecutor 
20 
you look at the evidence that is contained in the docket and that is the 
basis on which you make a decision whether to prosecute or not.  You 
can look at a memorandum or a recommendation or whatever you want 
to call it from an investigator but that does not inform your decision as 
a prosecutor.  Because your decision must be based on what evidence 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 54 of 182 
 
is contained in the docket?  Even if we were to say there were two 
separate reports with two separate recommendations those cannot in 
any way influence the decision of the NPA because the NPA must make 
their decision based on the evidence that is contained in the docket.  
There is no allegation that we removed evidence from the evidence.  
The allegation is that we altered a report.  Now I cannot alter a report 
that I have not seen in the first place.  But also importantly in the – in 
the discovering our criminal – in the criminal investigation that they did 
against us one of the senior advocates in the NPA actually depose a 
statement to say that he does not even remember seeing the report – 
10 
that so called first report in the docket.  But even if he had it means 
nothing to him because he does not make his decision based on such a 
report.  He makes a decision based on what is contained in the docket.  
However the NPA charged us for fraud that we tried to misrepresent to 
the prejudice of the NPA.  How is that possible? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see I mean everybody should know that an 
investigator you know might have different views at different stages of 
investigations about whether somebody was involved in a crime or not 
and whether they should be charged and so on and so on.  But that is 
nothing – that is not something that is confined to investigators.   
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean a lawyer who is consulted by a client will have 
a certain view at a certain time about how good that client’s case is. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – but later on he or she can change that view 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 55 of 182 
 
depending – he or she can change that view if there additional 
evidence. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he or she can change that view even if there is no 
additional evidence. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By simply reflecting further. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same evidence. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Judges do the same thing.  I mean you and Mr 
McBride have told me certain things about this issue.  On my mind 
prima facie I have certain views and they might be apparent from were 
some of my questions. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I have not made a final decision and when those 
people come here and give evidence who knows maybe they can 
change my mind and show me that actually you people did something 
terrible. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know but as things stand I cannot understand 
what the whole issue was about.  And – so even if there were two views 
one saying General Sibiya and General Dramat must be charged and 
the later one saying they must not be charged it is two views and I 
would thought that it would have been apparent from a proper reading 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 56 of 182 
 
of the second report that there was something additional to what had 
been there when the first report was made 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that that on its own should have told anybody 
that that must be the reason why the recommendation is different and 
then what – why there was a need to investigate – to appoint a law firm 
to investigate that before IPID was asked to explain this is something 
that I hope somebody will explain to me in due course.  Yes you may 
proceed Ms Wentzel. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair it gets worse. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The – we made recommendations that 
Colonel Maluleke “Cowboy” be charged criminally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The NPA on its wisdom at the time of former 
NDPP Shaun Abrahams and other prosecutors that were dealing with 
this decided to – to prosecute General Dramat and General Sibiya the 
same way they decided to prosecute us.  The case against us were 
withdrawn. The cases against General Dramat and Sibiya were also 
withdrawn.   It is only Colonel Maluleke “Cowboy” who is still facing 
20 
criminal charges in line with our recommendations.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Now there is an acknowledgment by NPA 
that actually what is recommended it is a correct position because 
there is not evidence that can sustain criminal charges against General 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 57 of 182 
 
Dramat and General Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the meantime you were put through a certain 
process. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr Sesoko when did you first 
learn about the Werkmans Report? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair I think it was around April when the – 
the report was – was released.  It was on a Sunday I was on – I was in 
church so when I am in church my phone is always off.  And when I got 
10 
out of church I opened my phone and for the first time my phone was so 
busy because it was just messages and messages and missed calls.  
And when I checked I find it was family members, friends, people who 
know me who were saying there is a report in the Sunday Times.  I 
think it was on the first page alleging wrongdoing against me, McBride 
and Mr Khuba. And upon seeing these messages I then sent my son to 
go and get me the newspaper and for the first time I then realised that 
Werkmans has released a report.  Now as people who are implicated in 
the report no-one dared to contact us about this.  The journalists that 
were writing the story MZilikazi Wa Afrika from the Sunday Times as 
20 
well as Mr Hofstadter never bothered to contact us about this report 
which was making adverse findings against us.  These are the very 
same journalists Chair who made reports on the SARS rogue unit.  Also 
on the General Booysen’s issues with Cato Manor.  The same 
journalists.  So to me it looks like they were working with particular 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 58 of 182 
 
people within the – the cluster to put – to push a particular agenda and 
to deal with us because we are not compliant to the agendas that they 
needed to achieve.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko is it the same journalists that you 
refer to in paragraph 29 of your statement when you said that you were 
alerted to a media enquiry that the journalists had a copy of the so 
called first report of Mr Khuba? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair.  Because also what 
we must ask ourselves is how did the journalists came – come into 
10 
possession of that report which Mr Khuba had only shared with 
Advocate Mosing?    As I have indicated that as IPID we never shared 
such a report at least from what Mr Khuba he only shared that report 
with Advocate Mosing.  The only report that we gave to the Minister is 
the report that was signed by all of us in the NPA that was sent also to 
the NPA. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now the official date of release of the 
Werksmans Report so after it was leaked is the 24 t h April 2015.   The 
report is Annexure MS2 at page 62.  Could you just confirm that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What then happened after the release of this 
report? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  After – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – before we get to – to what happened 
after what was – what was the finding of this report in relation to your 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 59 of 182 
 
role insofar as you were concerned?  What did it find in regard to 
yourself? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair the report made a finding that I am 
guilty of defeating the ends of justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And extortion I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  By altering the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Despite the fact that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Even from the interviews – I mean when you 
read the report Chair you cannot find even a connection.  I tried to find 
a connection – how do they come to that conclusion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Based on what was presented on them.  I 
cannot find it.  But the report concludes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In that fashion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think the – I think the relevant people from 
20 
Werksmans will have to come and explain some of the findings that 
they made – make me understand their findings.  It is just difficult to 
understand how you can say somebody who was party to the 
preparation and production of one report and was not involved in any 
way on the production of another report can be said to have altered the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 60 of 182 
 
first report.  It is just something I have immense difficult understanding.  
But again maybe when they come they will be able to explain it to and 
maybe I will understand it. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is the finding they made against you? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja.  I hope they do Chair because also what 
I take umbrage with the – the – the attorney who dealt with this report 
Ms Sandile July the least I would have expected was that the fact that 
they assured me that my basis of participation in that interview with 
them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It is not about making such findings.  At 
least at the time when they were doing their report and they think that 
they want to make such finding to have an audacity to come to me and 
say based on the evidence that we have we think we are going to make 
findings against you, do you have anything – any representation or 
anything you want to say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In relation to that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That never happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively what you are saying is after you had met 
with them and you had told them that you had nothing to do with the 
first report and therefore could not say anything about it you had 
something to do with the second report.  If after that they had met with 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 61 of 182 
 
witnesses and obtained statements from witnesses who said you were 
involved in that way or in any other way. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the basis of which they could recommend criminal 
charges or disciplinary steps the least they could have done is to come 
back to you and say since our last meeting we have obtained the 
following. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or we have reflected on what you said and we have 
this to put to you, what do you say about this because we might make 
10 
findings that could be – go against you.  That is what you are saying 
and you say they did not do that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  They did not do that Chair.  And that – I 
mean that is a basic tenant of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Of – of our law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes continue – continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Could you have regard to 
paragraph … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Sorry Chair I – I think I need to also 
20 
indicate this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That at the criminal proceedings against us 
on the day that because we have been insisting that this matter must 
go on trial and the NPA was dilly dallying did not want to go on trial.  
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 62 of 182 
 
We ultimately were able to force them to agree to a trial date.  On the 
day that the matter was supposed to be tried the prosecutor from the 
NPA Advocate Maema then tells the Magistrate that the witnesses are 
not there and that one of their witnesses Mr Sandile July who authored 
this report is refusing to testify and he has threatened the NPA that if 
they can force him to testify he will take them to court.  Now we found 
ourselves in the situation that we were on the basis of this report but 
the author of the report says I am not going to testify and even 
threatens the NPA to take them to court if they try to force him to 
testify.  Now you ask yourself why then?  Why make such a report but 
10 
you cannot stand by it?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have instructed the legal team and the 
investigation team to secure the relevant files and dockets relating to 
the criminal proceedings relating to you and Mr McBride and Mr Khuba 
was also charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not?  Yes.  I have said that I want to see exactly 
what documents the person who made the decision that you be charged 
had before him or her.   
I will want that person to come and give evidence.  Maybe they 
20 
will be able to show that there were proper grounds for the decision to 
charge and if that is so it is important that their side of the story be 
heard.  But if there we no proper grounds it would be to say the least 
most regrettable that people were put through this process without such 
grounds.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 63 of 182 
 
So – so that process is happening to obtain those dockets and 
files and the relevant people will be asked to come and give evidence 
so that I can understand properly.  Because there certainly is an 
allegation that sometimes the police were used, sometimes the NPA 
were used, sometimes all of them were used improperly in order to deal 
with certain individuals who may not have been prepared to do certain 
things and that is a serious allegation against these very important 
institutions, the police and the NPA and it should not be made unless it 
has proper grounds.   
And if it is made it must be investigated properly because if it 
10 
is found to be well-founded then something quite serious should be 
done.  Because we cannot afford to have these institutions being 
manipulated or used for improper motives and agendas.  So that is the 
part of the reason why I want to see all of those things. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes and we will make sure… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That we get all those things to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please.  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can we go back to paragraph 36?  Could you 
tell the Chair what happened on 11 May 2015?  So this is just a few 
20 
weeks after 24 April 2015 which is the date of the Werksmans Report. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  On 11 May Chair I was called by the Acting 
Executive Director Mr Kgamanyane and in that meeting - which I 
recorded Chair - he had indicated that he is intending to suspend me.  
In fact he gave me a letter of his intention to suspend me.  Now I think 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 64 of 182 
 
it is important Chair that I indicate to you that prior to this incident 
myself and Mr Kgamanyane enjoyed quite a cordial relationship as 
colleagues. 
In fact in my prior role as the Provincial Head for - for North 
West I would even assist him in - after he was appointed the Provincial 
Head for Free State setting up his office.  Assisting him with personnel 
from my office so that he can assist him to be able to manage the office 
properly.  So I regarded him as one of those close colleagues and when 
I sat with him on this day and - and he was saying that he intends to 
suspend me I was taken aback especially coming from him and him 
10 
knowing the kind of person I am and - and I even asked him but you, 
you are doing this to me and he said to me Chair in vernacular that you 
know when you - you join the police and they tell you to go and arrest - 
they tell you to go and arrest your father you must do it. 
So in the context of our conversation it was clear to me that 
he was saying that he has been instructed by the Minister to suspend 
me and I accepted that it is - it is going to happen and what was 
interesting also in our conversation is that he specifically asked me 
about two specific high profile investigations that we were busy with.  
The Panday matter which General Booysen has testified to … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In this Commission about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Now that matter Chair was initially 
investigated by the Hawks in KZN but because of the interference with 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 65 of 182 
 
the investigation in that matter the matter was then reported to us by 
Parliament.  Then that is how we got involved in that investigation.  We 
requested the dockets from the - the Hawks and they provided us with 
all these dockets and upon perusing that it was clear that there was 
large scale corruption by members of the SAPS and a service provider 
there Mr Panday worth millions of - of Rands but there was also a - a 
memorandum there authorised by one of the prosecutors where there 
were basically declining to prosecutor some of these cases. 
We wrote to the NDPP that that decision must be reviewed.  
We also conducted some of the investigations that were outstanding in 
10 
collaboration with the members of the Hawks and then we forwarded 
these matters to the NPA.  Mr Nxasana then appointed a - a prosecutor 
to - to look at this matter.  It was clear that this is one of the politically 
charged investigations. 
The initial prosecutor who was involved actually begged down 
on the matter and we - we had a meeting with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean the - when you say initial prosecutor you 
mean the one who declined to prosecutor … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No, no.  The one that was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the one that was appointed by (intervenes)? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The one that was appointed by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nxasana? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Mr Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  He or she begged (intervenes)? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja.  She - she begged down on the matter 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 66 of 182 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And then we - we had a discussion with 
Mr Nxasana and then we - we then said you must look at a - a 
prosecutor who has the zeal and who is not afraid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To deal with such matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And then the name of Advocate Gerrie Nel 
came up and Advocate Nxasana then in terms of their own processes 
10 
appointed him with the necessary delegations to deal with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  With this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So at the time when I had these 
engagements with Mr Kgamanyane … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And realising how things were panning out 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We had already taken these - all these 
dockets … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To Advocate Gerrie Nel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 67 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To be able to make a decision.  In fact he 
had already consulted with some of the witnesses and he was ready to 
- to proceed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  With one of the - the dockets.  I think it is 
Durban Central 4-4-6 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO: 
 
Of 
bribery 
by 
murder 
to 
- 
to 
General Booysen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And - so when - when I was asked by 
Mr Kgamanyane about specifically these cases and the other one was 
in relation to General Mabula and his team and - and allegations - there 
were allegations of torture and - and murder and we had at that time 
recently received an audio recording as well as a transcribe - a 
transcription of that audio from General Booysen by one of the 
members of - who was involved with that team who basically was telling 
how people were - were tortured and one of the suspects killed. 
So when I was asked about these cases I thought that maybe 
the Acting Executive Director wanted to - to prioritise maybe these 
20 
investigations.  To my surprise when we came back nothing had 
happened on these investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that on the day that you had a 
meeting with Mr Kgamanyane when he gave you the notice of intention 
to suspend you that is the day he - that is the occasion when he asked 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 68 of 182 
 
you about … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This investigations? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Specifically about these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the way in which he asked you did it - did it 
make you to think that he was trying to plan what would happen in case 
you were suspended or …? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To me that was the - the clear intention 
10 
because why specifically these - these cases you know.  I mean there 
were a number of cases that we were dealing with.  Why specifically 
these ones?  So it - it was clear that he - he had an interest specifically 
on these ones and the question is why he had interest in these specific 
cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the one theory could be that now that you were 
going to be - you were likely going to be suspended he had to make 
arrangements for somebody to handle these matters.  Obviously he had 
- he had to make sure that all the matters that you were handling - you 
were handling should be handled by somebody.  Things should not be 
20 
at a standstill while you were on suspension. 
That is - that is one theory but depending on the facts one 
may also have - one could have had the situation where maybe they 
were affecting what was happening but that that - that does not seem to 
- to have been what was in your mind.  What is your mind - was in your 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 69 of 182 
 
mind 
was 
that 
he specifically - specifically 
wanted 
to 
make 
arrangements for after you had gone. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  If you want to be generous Chair is that - 
that theory that he wanted to make sure that these … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  These matters were - were dealt with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So that in my absence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Someone deals with these - with these 
10 
matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But the fact of the matter is 18 months later 
after we came back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No such thing happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So if there was that kind of concern … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Why is it that they were not prioritised and 
20 
dealt with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Accordingly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And I had to start when I came back … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 70 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To make sure that these matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Are pursued … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Till they reach conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And just to clarify this meeting took place on 
11 May 2015 and when you were ultimately reinstated it was - as you 
say 18 months later - 23 November 2016? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  There in that paragraph 36 apart 
from the Panday matter.  You referred to the other matter as the 
General Jan Mabula team matter.  Is that correct? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair.  That is the one I am 
referring to as the - the torture and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Murder case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Case, yes. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Incidentally we have received recently a 
decision to prosecute these … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  These police officers - General Mabula and 
his team on these … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 71 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  On those torture matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And on the murder case the NPA is 
considering centralising this murder and torture case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because they are related to each other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And to prosecute them as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you have said that in regard to the Panday 
10 
matter the matter was - had political connections.  Is that right? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The other one did it also have political 
connections or not really? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Not - not really Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But this Mabula team as it will become 
apparent in my further testimony here is that this is the team that has 
been used … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To disrupt people like us who is trying to 
fight … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Deal with issues of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 72 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Corruption and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It is the very same team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  When we are investigating … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Allegations of corruption against General … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO: 
 
Former 
National 
Commissioner 
General Phahlane … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That they were brought in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To interfere … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  With our investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In fact we had to go to court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To interdict them from doing so … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which court case we won with costs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Against them and the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think Mr McBride did give evidence about - 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 73 of 182 
 
about that team … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well, yes.  Just on your meeting with 
Mr Kgamanyane you said that he said to you that you know that when 
you join the police when you are told to go and arrest you go and arrest 
and then you made a certain inference from that and you said you - it 
became clear to you that he was - he had been instructed by the 
Minister. 
Do you want to talk more about that?  Why the Minister?  Why 
would you particularly bring the Minister into that? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he did not mention the Minister. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO: 
 
Earlier 
we 
spoke 
about 
the 
- 
the 
appointment to that acting position and you rightly pointed out that at 
Executive Management no one was appointed but him.  Just prior to 
that we have in IPID what you call MANCO.  That is the - the 
management … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Committee? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Committee meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Where all the Executive Management and 
the Provincial Head sits and discusses issues relating to departmental 
operations and so forth and in that meeting the Executive Director had 
asked us to - to discuss this issue of the rendition case and what we - 
we realised when we were engaging with colleagues in terms of this 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 74 of 182 
 
matter was that Mr Kgamanyane who is normally very talkative in - in 
that kind of setup was completely quiet in that meeting and then a few - 
few months or so later when after McBride is - is suspended he is 
appointed to - to Act. 
Now you must understand that the - there has been always a 
- a - contact with Khuba and Khuba will testify to this by not only 
Mr Sandile July but also the Minister himself that he must go and - and 
talk to the - the Werksmans people.  So when you - when you connect 
all these dots and also when Khuba was served with the - the 
suspension letters the - the Head of Corporate Services Ms Siyanda (?) 
10 
was instructed to go and serve him and he made it clear to Mr Khuba 
that the instruction that came was that the Minister wanted him to be 
served on that particular day. 
So 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
these 
instructions 
were 
not 
Kgamanyane’s doing per se but he - he was receiving instruction and I 
surmise that that was the only reason he was appointed.  So that he 
can execute a particular agendas that were wanted by the then 
Minister. 
WCHAIRPERSON:  In any event is the position that if - is the position 
that the Minister - the person that the Minister needs to talk to in 
20 
regard private matters would be the Executive Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It will be the Executive Director.  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if - if the Minister had to say anything it would 
have - he would have had to speak to Mr Kgamanyane … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 75 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As the Acting Executive Director? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  For completeness the minute of 
this discussion that you had on 11 May 2015 is Annexure MS3 and you 
will find it page 137. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you have a look at page 139 is the 
statement at around line 10 what you were referring to about which 
10 
gave you the impression that the instructions came from above? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a reference there in that line 10 to “Chief”.  
Do you know who that reference relates to?  Who was Mr Kgamanyane 
referring to as “Chief” there? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Kgamanyane said “Chief” he was referring 
to me sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is how he used … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To call each other? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  to call me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And he also - you will see he said that at the - 
probably line about 14/15.  It says at the end: 
“So it is a difficult one.  A very, very difficult one.” 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 76 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct because you see hence I am 
saying in the context of our - our … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Relationship? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Engagement and - and our relationship it 
was clear to - to me that he also had difficulty … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Doing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Doing this, ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know but because he - he had an 
instruction … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  He had to do it because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is the reason he - he is occupying that 
- that position at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you - you also say earlier on in the page 
at 139 to him you say: 
20 
“I understand your position because probably 
obviously you are being instructed to give us this 
notice of suspension and I do not expect to get a 
different 
outcome 
after 
that 
no 
matter 
what 
representation.” 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 77 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes because it was clear to me Chair that 
you know it is - it is a foregone conclusion … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Where this is going.  So - and I was very 
frank with him because it was someone as I said I was - I was close to 
and I was very frank with him and it was clear.  I mean he - he never 
disputed what I was saying to him.  In fact even after I received that 
and I engaged my - my legal team and we wrote to him reasons why I 
should not be suspended and they were very compelling reasons but we 
knew that it is not going to give us a different outcome … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just an exercise.  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know and in terms of the SMS 
Handbook which was used to - to do this - this process.  It is very clear 
under what circumstances do you suspend a person you know.  In this 
instance for instance SMS Handbook will say if for instance there is a 
suspicion that we will interfere with investigation and so forth then that 
is when you can be or you interfere with an investigation that is when 
you will be suspended. 
In this instance there was already a Werksmans Report.  So 
the investigation basically was done.  So there was really no basis to 
20 
suspend us and these are the issues that we - we made representations 
on but of course we knew that you know - I mean I think the response 
was a day after we - we made that.  So it was clear there was no 
application of mind also to what we have said you know and we - we 
were in fact suspended. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 78 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if you have regard to paragraph 37 it is 
correct that you were then suspended on 21 May 2015? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then on 7 July 2015 you were served with 
a notice to attend a disciplinary inquiry.  That is annexure … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  I think I would like 
Mr Sesoko to - to read to us that part starting from line nine which 
relates to how he says Mr Kgamanyane explained his position.  I think - 
I think it is - it is important including the - the Setswana version or part 
of it is Setswana at page 1-3-9. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
“This thing is finally …” 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So Mr Kgamanyane says here: 
“This thing is finally it is like as and when 
(Setswana).  That is when you are to be confirmed.  
You are a police officer and they say that before 
(Setswana).  Before we can confirm you as a police 
20 
officer go and arrest your father.  So it is difficult 
one.  A very difficult one.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 79 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So - and this is in the context of the - the 
previous … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Paragraph where I say to him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  “I understand your position and 
probably obviously you are being instructed …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  “…to give us this notice of 
suspension and I do not expect a different outcome 
10 
after that no matter what representation.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And that is when he intervenes in this 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So he basically confirms … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what you were thinking. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That he is being instructed … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To - to suspend us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So effectively saying when you joined the police 
if they - before they confirm you.  If they say go and arrest your father. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 80 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to go and arrest your father. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And who are they.  They are your superiors 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Your superiors. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And in this instance who is Kgamanyane’s 
superior … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As Acting Executive Director. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the Minister.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So on 7 July 2015 you were served with a 
notice to attend a disciplinary inquiry.  It is Annexure MS4 on page 159.  
Is that correct? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then you also then received a charge 
20 
sheet which is MS5 on page 162? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what were those charges? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair should I read the charges? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 81 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Unless they are too long then you can just 
mention the essential allegations. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. You can just summarise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Maybe the essential allegations without 
necessarily reading … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of them to say charge 1 was that - the allegation 
was that it was fraud and that this is what I had done according to them 
or something to that effect.  If it is going to be easy.  If it is going to be 
difficult for you maybe you can read - read it. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair I think as I - I said earlier the nub of 
the - the charges and maybe I should - I should read them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is also a quote on page 11 of your 
affidavit if that is of assistance to you from the charge sheet. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  I think Chair when you look at 
annexure - 162 those are the criminal charges. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And then the - on - on - my statement on - 
20 
on 38 it is more about the - the disciplinary. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So when you look at 38 or the disciplinary 
charge and in fact at 39 the disciplinary charge you will see it says: 
“You Sesoko and McBride altered the report which 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 82 of 182 
 
had - which had been handed over to the NPA and 
deleted 
information 
incriminating 
Lieutenant-
General Anwar Dramat the former National Head of 
DPCI and/or Sibiya the Provincial Head of DPCI - 
DPCI Gauteng from the report in order to reach a 
conclusion that Dramat and Sibiya have been 
exonerated by IPID when you knew or ought to have 
known that the final IPID Report of January 2014 
recommended that Dramat and Sibiya be criminally 
charged.  By altering the report of January you and 
10 
Sesoko have made yourself guilty of dishonesty and 
defeating the ends of justice.” 
So that was the - the nub of the - the disciplinary charge 
against us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the - the allegation that you had altered the first 
report was a pillar of the charges? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That was the pillar of the charges Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No matter how much we tried to explain … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  These issues even at the - at the 
disciplinary … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It was clear that the intention has already 
made or  
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 83 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The decision has already been made that 
we must be removed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because no one was willing to listen … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To that despite what the Act - IPID Act says 
in relation to how we do our work.  Despite what the IPID Regulation 
says in relation how we do our work.  Despite what our internal 
standard operating procedure says how we do our work.  No one was 
10 
willing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To look at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that in the charge sheet they said you were 
guilty of defeating the ends of justice. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The charge - you were charged with defeating the 
ends 
of 
justice 
by 
recommending 
in 
the 
second 
report 
that 
General Dramat and General Sibiya should not be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But actually your position was that you were actually 
ensuring that there was justice? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if they were charged that would be an 
injustice? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 84 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ultimately the NPA itself which was charging you 
with this charge dropped charges against the two of them. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore confirming that you were seeking to ensure 
that there was justice because they wouldn’t have withdrawn those 
charges if they thought that would not accord with charges? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Mr Sesoko the charge sheet in the 
10 
disciplinary hearing is at page 198 if you could just confirm that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   198 it’s Annexure…[intervenes]. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Yes that is correct.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now what was the ultimate result of your 
disciplinary hearing? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair, I was dismissed on the 16 t h of 
August when I was in hospital, I was hospitalised for depression 
because what had happened is that the disciplinary inquiry was set 
down for about a week and the days prior to the 16 t h it as clear to me 
20 
that no matter what defence we are putting, no matter what evidence 
we are trying to show there was no interest in that.  Now when I left the 
disciplinary hearing on the 15 t h I was not well.  I actually did not even 
realise that I was depressed and when I got home my wife said, no 
you’re not fine, I must take you to a doctor.  Went to a doctor and then 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 85 of 182 
 
the doctor said, you are not well at all you are depressed and then he 
gave me some medication to be able to sleep – with instruction that 
first thing in the morning I must go to a psychiatrist, he wrote the 
referral letter and I went to consult psychiatrist, who then immediately 
had me admitted in hospital for depression, I spent two weeks in 
hospital on depression.  While that happens the disciplinary on the 
other side continues, my legal team informs me that.   It was clear to 
them that no matter what happens that disciplinary was supposed to 
end on that day.  No matter how much they tried to put forth that I am 
not well and I’m in hospital that was not taken into account.  In fact 
10 
they say to me that they even suggested that the matter be temporarily 
adjourned so that they can try and get hold of me wherever I was to 
bring me so that the Chairperson could see my condition and that was 
also refused.  So I never got to testify because I was in hospital, I 
never got to mitigate because my legal team informed me Chair, that we 
need to take instruction on mitigation, that never happened and as a 
result of that I was dismissed in my absence.  It was really a traumatic 
event for me and my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then there was an arbitration? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   There was an arbitration subsequent to 
20 
that and then my legal team and my employer reached a settlement 
agreement that I be re-instated.  I must hasten to say Chair, that I was 
convicted on the basis of a testimony of one witness, Advocate Musi.  
Now the charge against me, as you would have realised Chair is that I 
altered a report.  Advocate Musi never gave any testimony that I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 86 of 182 
 
altered report, in fact, when my legal team challenged him on this issue 
to say, does he know whether I altered the report, he said, no I don’t 
know if he altered the report except what I heard from Mr Khuba, that 
was his response.  So from a simple legal logic, you can’t charge me 
for altering a report and there is no evidence that is placed before a 
disciplinary inquiry that says, I’ve altered a report.  At best you have a 
hearsay of Musi who says he would have heard that from Mr Khuba and 
Mr Khuba is not even called to confirm that he would have said that to 
Advocate Musi and his employer closes its case on the basis of that 
evidence and I’m found guilty of these charges.  That’s how upset this 
10 
whole disciplinary process was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I said earlier on there was – I indicated, I think in 
April that the question of whether or not I can hear that evidence and 
make any finding is something to be subjected to a certain process, so 
I’ve heard it but I won’t do anything about it until that process has 
happened. As I indicated earlier on, from the statement it appeared that 
there was nothing more being said than simply that a hearing took 
place in my absence, this is what I was charged with, I asked for a 
postponement it was refused and I was found guilty and dismissed in 
my absence without going beyond that but I think that we’ll subject all 
20 
of this to that process whether in the end I – it should be heard by 
somebody else and if so, how in terms of law is something that must 
still be looked at and submissions be made but yes, okay lets continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   What happened with the disciplinary 
proceedings against Mr Khuba? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 87 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair, around September when the 
disciplinary was set to continue…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe I must ask you, since Mr Khuba is going 
to come and give evidence, don’t you want him to talk about his one or 
is there some connection that…[intervenes]. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   There is a connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a connection okay? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Around September, Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which year, 2015? 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   The disciplinary was supposed to continue, 
it was now with a different Chairperson before Advocate Zondo was 
appointed Chair and – because at that point I was also hospitalised, I 
had an accident with my foot and I had to go for an operation.  So, 
because I was not there, then they separated our trials, which is 
perfectly fine but then Mr Khuba reached a plea bargain with the 
employer.  Now Mr Khuba will talk to that I wouldn’t want to talk to how 
that happened but Mr Khuba did engage me on the fact that there is 
20 
this proposal that is put on the table and we had a very lengthy 
discussion about it and my advice to him was that it was a bad idea and 
even though his lawyer had indicated to him that it’s so that he can get 
his job back and it’s not like he’s admitting to any wrongdoing per se 
and what I said, and I remember vividly, I said to him, you know in the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 88 of 182 
 
work that we do our reputation and integrity is our currency and once 
that is being questioned then it affects your career but be that as it may 
he entered into that agreement and then he was given a written warning 
and then we were alerted to the fact that – by our National 
spokesperson that [indistinct] Africa has made contact with him to say 
that he will be running a front page article to the effect that it’s 
confirmed that McBride lied, or something to that effect and I then 
contacted Khuba and said are you aware this is what is happening and 
Mr Khuba was flabbergasted to say the least to say but this people it 
means this things they were doing it in bad faith and he said, you know, 
10 
they even made it clear to me that I can even continue to be a witness 
to you in your disciplinary so I don’t understand how this comes about.  
 
As a result of that Mr Khuba deposed an affidavit confirming 
what he was saying to me with regard to the circumstances surrounding 
the plea bargain that he did with the employer and our role in the whole 
thing and immediately upon Mr Kgamanyane becoming aware of that 
affidavit, Mr Khuba was summarily dismissed without a hearing. 
 
Remember that process had ended and he was given a written 
warning and then he’s now summarily dismissed…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And his suspension was uplifted? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Was uplifted he is now back at work but 
because he had deposed that affidavit then he is summarily dismissed.  
Now it became clear to us that, because of that affidavit the story that 
Mr Africa was saying he was going to run…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could no longer be run. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 89 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Never came to fruition as he had hoped it 
would.  There was a story that it was run but it was no longer as it 
would have been if this affidavit did not come through.  So – and I think 
that the powers that be were very upset about this and hence, Mr 
Khuba was dismissed summarily without following any process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whereas with regard to other situations when there 
were allegations of misconduct there would be a suspension first before 
there would be a disciplinary hearing.  On this occasion there was no 
suspension, there was no disciplinary hearing, he was just fired. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   He was just fired Chair, nothing 
10 
whatsoever I mean, you would have expected that they would then 
issue him with a notice of the intention to take disciplinary action 
against him and make allegations, what the allegations, if the 
allegation is that he has deposed an affidavit then let him say so, but 
nothing of that nature happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair is it a convenient time to take the lunch 
adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes where are we on the statement now, how far are 
we? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   We’re going to now proceed on page 13 from 
about paragraph 49. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that’s fine we’ll continue, if it looks like we 
might not be as fast as we were hoping to be, I think that the evidence 
is important and it justifies it, but we’ll see after lunch how it goes.  In 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 90 of 182 
 
the end we must make sure that justice is done to his evidence. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We’ll take the lunch adjournment now and well 
resume at 2 o’clock.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
  INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel I think Mr Sesoko’s statement is also to 
the effect that if I am not mistaken maybe it is not his statement but 
some document in the bundle I think is to the effect that there is a 
10 
judgment or order of the Labour Court that may have been made in 
regard to some interdict or review. Check that and if there is get 
copies.  Okay?  Alright let us continue.  Maybe before we continue Mr 
Sesoko in the second report I am trying to think back now – in the 
second report you obviously would have given reasons why you thought 
that General Dramat and General Sibiya should not be charged with 
misconduct or any crime, is that right? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did anybody whether it is the Minister or somebody 
from the NPA or anybody ever engage with your reasons to say but 
20 
these reasons you have given for this recommendation in the second 
report are just nonsense?  You – or even are just wrong? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  None whatsoever Chairperson.  You see as 
I was saying that it only transpired later that there were agendas into 
the whole issue.  Because what had happened was that at some point 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 91 of 182 
 
and I am sure if Mr Khuba will testify also about that.  At some point Mr 
Khuba and Mr Maoka who was our director legal services engaged with 
prosecutors at the NPA and Advocate Baloyi if I am not mistaken.  And 
in their discussion Advocate Baloyi was of the view that our 
investigative conclusion in what we were recommending it in our report 
was actually sustainable.  And when – at the later time again when they 
engaged with him then he allegedly informed them that after engaging 
with his superiors I think the word they used that he must just bite the 
bullet.  You know.  Mr Khuba and Mr Maoka deposed statements to that 
effect which the Executive Director referred to the NPA to say they 
10 
must look into this issue.  Of course nothing came of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but you say earlier on he said he conceded that 
– did he concede that the reasons given for that recommendation that 
there should be charges for General Sibiya and General Dramat – did 
he accept that… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were good reasons? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes, yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is that that? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But later on… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So at the time – at the time – excuse me – 
at the time they were engaging even… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Before the actual decision was taken. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 92 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And to their surprise at a later day I think it 
could have been days later then he said no they must bite the bullet 
after consulting with their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Superiors. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Superiors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So it was clear that even though he held an 
opinion at the time that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you – are – they were good grounds. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  They are good grounds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  For saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There should be no charges against you. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  There should be no charges but obviously 
someone higher up was saying no, no, no you should… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They must be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  They must be charged and hence ultimately 
the decision that was taken was that they must be charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which was later changed and they were… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The charges were now dropped against 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you know of nobody who ever said well there 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 93 of 182 
 
is something wrong with the basis for your recommendation that 
General Sibiya and General Dramat should not be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No.  No-one had said that Chair.  Even 
when you read the – the – the Werksmans Report nowhere in the report 
are 
they 
alleging 
that 
our 
investigative 
conclusion 
and 
our 
recommendation as per the report it is not sound in law?  None of that 
is alleged.  All what they are saying is that we altered the – the so 
called first report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So no-one comes to us and say but hang on 
10 
you have got it wrong here and here and here you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But you see to us what is also surprising is 
that in the work we do it happens every time.  We make 
recommendations to the NPA that says prosecute and then the NPA will 
say no we are not going to prosecute.  We accept that because it is 
within their domain to make those – they are an independent body that 
can make that decision despite our recommendation.  And sometimes 
you say prosecute and sometimes you say do not prosecute.  We do not 
think there is evidence and they will say, no actually we think there is 
20 
evidence to prosecute. So it is something that is normal in our 
environment.  So now to come and try and make a huge thing and we 
ended up being charged even criminally and departmentally about have 
an opinion about your investigation it is completely absurd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean in regard to Mr Khuba the best it seems that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 94 of 182 
 
could be said against him is that he changed his opinion not the report. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He changed his opinion from one that said General 
Dramat and General Sibiya should be charged to one that says they 
should not be charged. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the worst that what – that is the best that one 
can put it for the prosecutors. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in regard to you and Mr McBride it can only 
10 
amount to saying why did you reach the opinion that the conclusion that 
these two should not be charged? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  I agree with you Chairperson 
completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In fact also as regards Mr Khuba he – in the 
– McBride constitutional matter he deposed a comprehensive affidavit 
and I am sure he will testify about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Showing what were the differences. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And what in his opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Changed his views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 95 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So I mean there is a good reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Why we – he came to the conclusion that he 
did.  There is a good reason why I was of the view when I engaged with 
him that there was no evidence to sustain a criminal prosecution or I 
mean even misconduct against General Dramat and General Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And even if they did not agree with your conclusion 
that on its own should be no grounds to … 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To charge you. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. Exactly.   It is like – it is like just a 
simplistic example Chair.  It is like charging a Supreme Court or High 
Court Judge for having arrived at a particular decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which is different from maybe a Supreme 
Court to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It does not make sense.

CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sesoko you were 
arrested on the 16 t h March 2016 – I am reading from paragraph 49 on 
page 13 of your affidavit.  Could you… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 96 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Pardon?  It is paragraph 39. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes I am saying that is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry.  Could you explain to the Chair the 
circumstances of your arrest? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair what had happened was that we were 
first approached by these investigators from the DPCI unit called CATS.  
It is the Crimes Against The State.   
Now as we understand this units mandate in the DPCI it is 
10 
actually to investigate serious crimes against the state like your cases 
of treason, terrorism and so forth.  So it was actually interesting that 
they are now investigating a case of fraud and defeating the ends of 
justice.   
Incidentally the same unit is the very same unit that was 
investigating Minister Gordhan and the so called SARS rogue unit.  In 
fact when they called us to their offices for a warning statement the – it 
was our files and then their – their rouge unit file was there as if it was 
– they were trying to show us that they are also doing that – that 
investigation.   
20 
But we submitted comprehensive statements as warning 
statements explaining this whole issue.  My warning statement was 
about a file.  If my memory serves me well I think Mr Khuba’s could 
have been two files, arch lever files.  Mr McBride was possible five/six 
arch lever files.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 97 of 182 
 
I think we submitted our statement on a Thursday or on a 
Friday but on Sunday we got messages that we must come to their 
offices a decision has been made that we must be charged criminally. 
We presented ourselves to their offices and they processed us 
they took our fingerprints and so forth.  Low and behold for the first 
time we realised that actually they had warrants for our arrest.  Now we 
are senior government officials and not flight risk to anyone.  And also 
given the nature of the allegations against us in my humble view they 
did not warrant a J50 Warrant of Arrest.   
But be that as it may we were taken to police cells where we 
10 
were kept for some few hours until we appeared in court and then 
granted R1 500.00 bail.   
It was the most humiliating moment of my life.  Because I 
never imagined that I will get arrested in that fashion purely for doing 
my job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And was this aired on television – your 
arrest? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  It was a very big spectacle because 
there was media all over.  It was on radio, on television.  As we were 
20 
walking we were being followed by journalists and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I said earlier this morning that I have given 
instructions that all dockets or files that will show me what information 
the relevant prosecutors or people and the police relevant police 
officers had before them before they made certain decisions should be 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 98 of 182 
 
gathered.   
I want to take this opportunity now that you have said how 
much information you placed before them yourself, Mr McBride and Mr 
Khuba.  I would like you to assist the commission to get as much of that 
documentation as possible. 
I have been told that there have been challenges in getting 
these documents.  I think it has been months that I asked that they be 
found.  Whether it is court papers in regard to those of you who went to 
court on matters which may be related to what we are dealing with in 
regard to you.  Whether it is court papers, court judgments.  Whether it 
10 
is police – I mean the prosecutors files, everything in terms of being 
charged on matters that relate to this.  I want to see all of that.  
Because I want to see whether on – on what was before various people 
– various offices there could be a basis for anybody to make the 
decisions that were made and – so please if you could speak to also Mr 
McBride and Mr Khuba if you could all assist the relevant person within 
the commission is Ms Lerato Buthelezi.  There are investigators who 
have been working on it as well but she – if you – if you are in touch 
with her she will know who – what to do.  I want to see all of that. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair we will definitely do so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  All the information we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We will submit to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 99 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you very much.  You have already dealt 
with the fact that on the 1 s t November 2016 the case against you was 
withdrawn apparently because there were not any witnesses and the 
fact that Mr July refused to testify. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now is it correct that hereafter pursuant to a 
further – sorry I just – I have forgotten the name of what it was.  As a 
result of the appearance before the bargaining council an agreement 
and an arrangement was made that you would be reinstated? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that occurred on the 23 r d November 
2016? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The – arbitration sat on the 22 n d. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And the – the agreement was that I will go 
back to work on the 23 r d of November. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  So it was the next day? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair we will get the judgment and the 
arbitration or copies of the proceedings. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You touched on a little bit earlier what the 
state of play was when you returned to your work at – at IPID and the 
investigations that you had left a good year – eighteen months 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 100 of 182 
 
previously and where they were at – at this stage.  Could you deal in 
some detail now with those investigations and what happened and has 
been happening since you have been back in your job? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chairperson when I – I returned to work 
obviously I resumed my duties as the National Head of Investigation 
and the first thing I – I was confronted with was that Mr McBride in my 
absence because he came back earlier than me in October.  He had 
appointed a team which is in my unit.   
We call it ANSIT A National Specialised Investigative Team to 
investigate allegations of corruption against former Acting National 
10 
Commissioner General Phahlane.   
The complaint had come from Mr Paulo Solomon and when I 
started engaging with the team I was able to establish that Mr Paulo 
Solomon had approached IPID in March already whilst we were on 
suspension about these allegations.  And that IPID had done nothing to 
investigate these allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was now in November? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That was in November now 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And upon getting a complaint of this nature 
20 
– upon receiving complaint from Mr Solomon Mr McBride then 
established this team.  So when I came back I had to manage this 
team.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you recall around when Mr McBride had come 
back from his own suspension? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 101 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Mr McBride came – went back to the office 
in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so he had come back… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Of 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just the previous month? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes the previous month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So the team had already started 
investigating this matter and had also went to the residential premises 
– an estate… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that.  So prior to Mr McBride coming back 
in October all along the Acting Executive Head was Mr … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Kgamanyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kgamanyane. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And he did nothing to – to investigate this 
matter.  In fact as part of the investigation we were able to establish 
that he had made a contact with General Phahlane to make him aware 
of these allegations.  And he appointed Mr Gomo who was acting in my 
20 
position to – to the designated investigator in this matter.  However the 
team when they – they received this dockets after appointment by Mr 
McBride they found that no investigation was done on this – on this 
matter.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess it might not therefore be accurate to say 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 102 of 182 
 
nothing had been done completely in the sense that at least from the 
point of view of Mr Kgamanyane he had appointed somebody to be the 
investigator but then that person had done nothing. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja no investigation was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You see the issue is and the events that 
followed shows a – a pattern that there was never an intention to – to 
investigate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because the very same person who was 
10 
supposedly supposed to do this investigation upon our return then 
requested a transfer back to the police to the CI because he was in CI.  
So he got transferred back to the CI environment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was from Crime Intelligence? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So he got a transfer to the police to the 
Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was he not supposed to go back anyway upon 
your return because he was acting and had come from there. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No, no, no he was appointed in IPID.  Mr 
Kgamanyane had appointed him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As a Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 103 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  ANSIT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but then he got him to act. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So he was a permanent employee of IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of IPID yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But because – so this shows us that there 
was some shenanigans that were happening because immediately upon 
our return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Mr Kgamanyane got a transfer initiated by 
the Minister and General Ntlemeza to the DPCI. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And without now… 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Without the consent of the Executive 
Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Minister now was still Mr Nathi Nhleko? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  And then Mr Gomo also requested 
transfer back to the SAPS and he was transferred back to the CI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they – they both elected to get out of IPID? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Upon your return. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr McBride’s return. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas prior to that they had been part of the staff 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 104 of 182 
 
of IPID? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And the very same Mr Gomo when we were 
now fighting and there was all this interference with our investigation 
and we – we were called by the Portfolio Committee on Police he came 
on tour with General Phahlane to support General Phahlane against us 
on these allegations against General Phahlane as they were being 
ventilated at the Portfolio Committee of Police.  So it was clear to us 
that there was never going to be any investigation against General 
10 
Phahlane by this group anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you might or might not have skipped to get to 
that point. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now that you are at that point why would he go to 
the Portfolio Committee because he was no longer in IPID he was back 
in Crime Intelligence – Mr Gomo? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  What – remember he was now in – he got 
transferred to work for the SAPS in CI, Crime Intelligence in SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The Portfolio Committee then invited IPID 
and SAPS and General Phahlane was still the Acting National 
Commission because these investigations we were conducting against 
him was over the media and I think the Portfolio Committee at the time 
in their wisdom they thought if they call us…; 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 105 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or if they called everybody. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who might have had something to do with this. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know to brief them what is happening 
on this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Then he also came as part of the delegation 
of General Phahlane. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So when – when – the investigation started 
in earnest.  General Phahlane then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were leading those investigations? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes I was not leading the investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I guess that must be 2017 then? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Still 2016? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Still 2016 in November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes.  So first the – there were threats to 
one of our investigators Mr Mandla Mahlangu – death threats to his life 
via sms messages.  He received two sms messages and in those 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 106 of 182 
 
messages they also made threats to the Executive Director Mr McBride 
as well as Mr Paulo Solomon.  And then as a result of those threats 
then we procured the services of Ms Theresa Botha to assist in tracking 
where these messages were coming from.  From Fidelita a security 
company.  But also what had happened was that General Phahlane then 
instructed and investigation that there was – or under the pretext that 
there was a security breach to his residence.  In fact we have 
statements from Crime Intelligence officials who attended to – to that 
complaint of General Phahlane and they depose a statement to us that 
upon attending to that complaint they have actually established that 
10 
there was no security breach.  In fact it was a legitimate IPID 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But General Phahlane not only did that – he 
called the Mabula team from North West to start an investigation on the 
pretext of the security breach.  But this was in fact their way of 
interfering with our investigation.  And they actually even approached 
the witnesses that had already deposed statements to our investigators 
on these allegations of corruption against General Phahlane.  And this 
Ma – General Mabula and his team approached the very same 
20 
witnesses.  As a result of that we laid criminal charges of defeating the 
ends of justice against both General Phahlane and the Mabula team 
and we investigated those matters and referred them to the NPA and 
the NPA declined to prosecute these matters. 
Saying that they will reconsider the prosecution with the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 107 of 182 
 
corruption investigations that we were still busy conducting.  Now we 
were of the view that there was enough evidence to - to prosecute.  So 
we are not happy with the decision.  We took up these issues with the 
NPA 
and 
the 
former 
National 
Director 
of 
Public 
Prosecution 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams. 
Raising our concern in relation to this matter.  Now this was 
not the only matter that we raised concern with.  It was also in relation 
to the investigation that we also conducted against Mr Kgamanyane 
himself on allegations of corruption and contravention of the PFMA.  
Now we - we had a lot of correspondences with the NPA in relation to 
10 
this issue and raising our concern how decisions were taken in relation 
to our matters and to our surprise the only - the- the response that we 
are getting from the NDPP was that he agrees with the decisions 
without giving us detail reason why in their view that these cases were 
not prosecutable. 
In my view if I make a representation that I am not happy with 
the decision that was taken by a particular prosecutor and then I - I 
would like you to review.  What I expect is that even if you agree with 
the decision that was taken but at least take an effort to explain what is 
the legal basis that decision but to say that there are no prospects of a 
20 
successful prosecution is not good enough because it is as good as 
saying I decline to prosecute in any event.  So those are the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just the conclusion without … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reasons? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 108 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know.  So those were - were the issues 
that we - we were raising.  I mean in one of the correspondences Chair 
I - I remember well General Phahlane has always been making 
allegations that we are being used by Paul O’Sullivan.  He even went to 
an extent when we were at the Portfolio Committee of calling us or our 
organisation OPID. 
O’Sullivan - you know O for O’Sullivan.  So he was calling 
OPID.  So he was making allegations that we - we have outsourced our 
10 
investigation to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To - to Paul O’Sullivan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  One of the correspondences that came from 
Advocate Shaun Abrahams was pushing the very same narrative.  To 
say no he has declined to prosecute.  He agrees with them.  Giving the 
circumstances that we had out - outsourced our investigation to - to 
Paul O’Sullivan or to a private individual.  Something to that effect.  I 
cannot remember the exact words. 
20 
Something that we could not understand.  We say how do you 
come to that conclusion before you engage with us.  We even had a - a 
meeting with him.  Myself and the Executive Director trying to raise 
these issues and our concern that you know how these decisions are 
taken and the - the inertia in - in taking this Phahlane investigation 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 109 of 182 
 
forward including the fact that the (“AFU”) Asset Forfeiture Unit was not 
acting on - on these matters. 
It was a very funny meeting because the - the management of 
the NPA sitting there were actually even excluded from talking.  It came 
to a serious confrontation between Mr McBride and Mr Shaun Abrahams 
to an extent that I have to - I had to calm down Mr McBride to say at 
the end we need to get this meeting through and try to get some 
solution to this problem because he was willing to leave at that time the 
way the - the meeting was charged. 
So the - the - these decisions did not make sense to us.  We 
10 
continued to engage the NPA even after he was removed as the NDPP.  
We engaged Dr Ramaite who was appointed to act as the NDPP and 
raise the same issues with him and Dr Ramaite undertook to appoint 
Advocate McAdams to look at all these cases and be able to deal with it 
and we started some work with him to start dealing with these issues. 
Unfortunately he was not officially appointed by Dr Ramaite 
so he could not take the matters further until recently Advocate Batohi 
was appointed to that position and then we engaged further with her 
and it is only now that we see these matters being taken seriously and 
being reviewed by - by the NPA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  These matters that you are talking about are they 
matters where you hold the view or have the perception that the refusal 
to prosecute was not based on or decisions not to prosecute were not 
based on legitimate legal grounds? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chairperson and in our 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 110 of 182 
 
correspondence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We sharply raised that.  We - we raised the 
issue that we believe that the NPA is biased in taking some of these 
decisions.  Just to make an example Chair.  In one of the matters where 
Mr O’Sullivan is the complainant.  The two senior advocates in the NPA 
took a decision that the - the officials from the Mabula team must be 
prosecuted and they did a memorandum to Advocate Maloy (?) to that 
effect. 
To our surprise when the decision - they - they informed us 
10 
about this and - and we even got hold of - of that memorandum.  To our 
surprise when the decision came the decision came as decline to 
prosecute.  When we questioned why decline to prosecute the response 
we get is no I agree with the DPP without giving us reasons what is the 
legal reason for not prosecuting. 
Especially in the face of senior advocates in that office 
saying there is a case to be answered here.  They even warned in their 
memorandum that the NPA could even suffer civil suits if these matters 
are not prosecuted.  So it shows and there is a pattern in - in other 
matters also that shows that there was that kind of bias and - and 
20 
unwillingness on the part of the NPA during that time to take our 
matters seriously and prosecute them. 
In fact the Panday matter nothing happened with it and even 
when we pursued it.  We were told that no there is a - a challenge by 
one of the complainants and so but nothing was happening but what is 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 111 of 182 
 
strange is that just before the - the judgment on the removal of 
Mr Shaun - Advocate Shaun Abrahams then the decision was made to 
prosecute.  So you only have to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without anything new having happened? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly.  You know you ask yourself but why 
does it happen now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know all of a sudden there is this 
decision now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  You know when all of the time we have been 
asking and nothing was happening.  So in our view … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  There was never an intention to - to deal 
with these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Only when in my view there was probably a 
- a realisation that he may be removed that he thought … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Maybe he must then make the right decision 
20 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  On - on this matter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But these other matters nothing had 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 112 of 182 
 
happened.  Only now with the new NDPP that there - there is actions … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  On these matters.  The Mabula matter for 
instance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  As I have indicated earlier on torture there 
is a decision already to prosecute on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now these matters where there have been refusals - 
decisions to refuse to prosecute that you are talking about.  Are you 
able to group them in one way or another under a particular category 
10 
maybe such as it is cases that have got political connections?  It is 
cases that relates to corruption that involves people who may have 
been in high places within Government or people who are close to 
people in high office in Government or anything like that or is it difficult 
to group them together?  They are just different cases. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair they can be grouped in that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The Panday matter for instance got political 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Connections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  The - the other matters it is high ranking 
police officers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 113 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We are talking Generals … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That are involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Later on in my statement I will talk about 
the matters relating to CI … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Crime Intelligence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Which involved also senior police officers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Where we stuck.  We cannot move forward 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  HM. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  With those investigations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because of refusal to declassify documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  So it is - it is - you know when - when we - 
we investigate low ranking officers … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We never get an interference … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But you start investigating Generals … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 114 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Then you get this kind of interference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Hence I said that we even had to go to 
court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To get an order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To stop the Mabula team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  From interfering with our investigations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well this Commission is supposed to also look 
at how the NPA may have also played a role in advancing State Capture 
or out of corruption protected certain people and it may well be that a 
lot of the cases you are talking about are cases that could show what 
you are talking about. 
Either part of State Capture or decisions not to prosecute 
being based on corruption and such like others - such like 
considerations and I would like you and your colleagues in - in IPID to - 
to consider looking at all those cases and looking at the terms of 
reference of the Commission and seeing whether you are able to select 
20 
all those that you think fall under our terms of reference. 
Where there is a reluctance or refusals to prosecute when 
actually there should have been prosecutions but not cases where it 
might say you know - you know somebody there could be different 
views and so on … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 115 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where you say look it really does look like there 
was some really illegitimate reasons for not prosecuting and if you are 
able to put those together do so and be in touch with the legal team so 
that ultimately maybe the Commission can look at all of them. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We will - we will certainly do so 
Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because it is part of the submissions that 
we have made to the NDPP … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Advocate Batohi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To say all these cases … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  These are the issues we have with them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And we feel that you know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Justice was not done … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  In these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
No 
please 
do 
that 
together 
with 
whatever 
correspondence you might have exchanged with the NPA where you 
were questioning why certain decisions were being taken or why 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 116 of 182 
 
prosecutions were not following.  So arrange to do that and it may well 
be that whether officially IPID does that or just individuals who are 
involved within IPID you know. 
Also come and assist the Commission with evidence that - 
that could be looked at. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We will certainly do that Chairperson.  I 
think also as part of the attachment to my statement I have attached 
some of the correspondences … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That we - we exchanged with the - the NPA 
10 
and raising … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  A specific concern … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  With regard to these matters.  I mean we - 
my honest view is that some of the Generals were being protected or 
some of the officers that were being used to put a particular - to push a 
particular agenda were being protected from prosecution.  Whereas 
others were being prosecuted.  I mean just to illustrate this 
Chairperson. 
20 
As part of the interference with our investigation and to 
counter our investigation the Mabula team arrested Mr Paul O’Sullivan 
when there was a court order that says they must not arrest him.  They 
further charged two of our investigators Mr Mahlangu and Mr Binang.  
In the indictment part of the charge is that they pretended to be IPID 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 117 of 182 
 
investigators but they are IPID investigators. 
Now I cannot fathom how a prosecutor draws up a charge 
sheet like that that says I am charging you for being - for pretending to 
be an IPID investigator when in fact you are an IPID investigator.  In 
any event in matters of this nature like where a person pretends to be a 
- a police officer one of the important statements that you must obtain 
is from IPID or from the SAPS to say whether this person is in fact a 
member of the police or a member of IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No such thing happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  No one came to us to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Are these people your investigators or not 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  But they are being charged for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I - I want to - I want all of those cases because 
we - we cannot hope to clean up corruption in this country if there is a 
lot of corruption within law enforcement agencies.  We - we cannot.  
20 
You know and it is not good for the country for people to know that if 
you are a low ranking official you will be arrested.  You will be charged. 
You will be brought to court but if you are high ranking you 
will be protected from prosecution.  You can do whatever corruption and 
do crime.  You will be protected.  It cannot be and if we cannot sort that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 118 of 182 
 
out then we just have no chance of sorting out corruption in this 
country.  So everybody needs to know that when our Constitution says 
everyone is equal before the law that is what everybody will implement. 
That is what courts will - will ensure is implemented.  That is 
what police will implement.  That is what everybody - everybody will do.  
You know the law is the only place where we are all supposed to be 
equal and - and if you have a situation where the general public thinks 
that the law - people are not equal before the law.  You bring the law 
into disrepute and the consequences for law and order in the country 
would be far reaching. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Sesoko could you also please tell the 
Chair about the interference that you had from Brigadier Ncube and the 
Mabula team approaching your investigators and offering bribes that 
you refer to in paragraph 65? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair.  Chair as I have 
already 
indicated 
that 
we 
had 
to 
go 
to 
court 
to 
interdict 
General Mabula’s team from interfering with our investigation and 
counter investigating us … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and really … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For - for one law enforcement agency to have to go to 
court to get an interdict against other law people to say do not interfere 
with our; to reach that stage things must be very bad. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 119 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair it was bad.  You see from our side we 
tried everything and understanding that we were within the same 
Ministry.  We tried our best to get this thing resolved internally.  So we 
approached the National - of course we could not approach 
General Phahlane because he is the one who brought them in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  To counter our investigation but after he 
was suspended by Minister Mbalula then we approached the then Acting 
National Commissioner General Mothiba to say we need to resolve this 
issue.  It cannot be that people that we are investigating as IPID start 
10 
investigating us.  Police has got almost 200 police officers. 
Surely you cannot tell me that you cannot find a police officer 
that will - is not subject of our investigation to investigate us if they 
believe there is some wrongdoing on the part of our investigators.  We 
are not immune to investigation and we - we welcome an investigation 
if there is any wrongdoing but you cannot ask the very people who are 
investigating to investigate us. 
Surely there will not be any objectivity in that investigation 
and that is exactly what Judge Tuchten found that these officers were 
conflicted and in fact in his judgment said that the police must go back 
20 
and look at their Act so that there is no conflict of interest in how the 
police conduct the investigation. 
We have a similar provision in our Act that our investigators 
cannot in a matter where they have got a conflict of interest.  So we - 
we tried in - in that kind of engagement and General … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 120 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that had to go to court for a Judge to … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To make a decision? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody within SAPS high up could say this is 
nonsense? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This should be sorted out.  Let us get other people to 
investigate? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Exactly Chair.  To General Mothiba’s credit 
10 
he instructed his legal team to sit with our legal team and try and 
resolve this - this matter.  We held a meeting with them and an 
advocate 
from 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
State Attorney. 
 
When 
the 
representative from General Mothiba’s office came and say my 
instruction from General Mothiba is that we must resolve this issue they 
refused.  They refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could they refuse? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Chair it is - it is a funny thing.  Even when 
we went to court the people who were opposing our application it was 
General Mabula and his team.  The National Commissioner was not 
20 
opposing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet they are under the National … 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Commissioner? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Yes Chair.  That is what happened.  The 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 121 of 182 
 
Judge read out a barrage of correspondences that we have been 
sending to the police management to try and get this thing resolved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And made it clear IPID tried to get this 
thing resolved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And there is no commitment on the police to 
get this thing resolved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  It is the same thing that is happening with 
10 
the issue of declassification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  We are now in court.  We - we - there is 
litigation pending on this issue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  Because they are refusing to declassify 
documents that we need for our investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if we do not have Judge Tuchten’s judgment here 
… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We have got it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please get a copy.  Have we got it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  We have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well now that you have touched on the issue of 
declassification.  You may or may not be aware that last week I heard 
evidence from Colonel Roelofse in regard to the challenges he met with 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 122 of 182 
 
trying to get the national - various National Police Commissioners to 
declassify various document that he needed for his own investigations 
and I - I have indicated that I will want to - I will want the National 
Commissioner to be approached so that he can give - he can say 
whether he is prepared to declassify those documents insofar as they 
are relevant for the Commission’s investigation or not and if he is not 
what the reasons are but I asked him whether there was not litigation 
because I thought I had read somewhere about there being litigation 
relating to declassification and relating to classification being for 
illegitimate reasons and so on. 
10 
So maybe that is - that is what I was thinking about.  If - if 
there is litigation that IPID is involved in. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  That is correct Chair.  What had happened 
was that after we had had an MOU with the Inspector-General of 
Intelligence we started getting involved in investigations that are 
happening in the Crime Intelligence particularly the Secret Service 
Account. 
 
There 
is 
widespread 
corruption 
happening 
in 
that 
environment. 
Now the - the first investigation actually we - we got involved 
is the same investigation that Colonel Roelofse was investigating 
20 
against General Mdluli.  Now the reason we got involved is also that it 
was also referred to us through Parliament because of the frustrations 
that Colonel Roelofse was experiencing and we wrote to the police 
about declassifying specifically those matters. 
That - it was in fact our first correspondence with them in 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 123 of 182 
 
relation 
to 
classification. 
 
We 
started 
with 
General Phahlane, 
General Mothiba, General Sithole.  None of them declassified these 
documents.  We followed up with a further request in relation to our 
investigations on I-View.  We call them I-View 1, two, three. 
Several millions of corruptions - tens of millions of corruption 
involved.  So we also asked declassification in those matters and there 
was no positive response.  In fact at some point we were called to 
SCOPA in Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To SCOPA, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  SCOPA, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  And we lamented the same thing that the 
police are refusing to declassify documents and the National 
Commissioner General Sithole made an undertaking in that meeting 
that within 14 days he will declassify the documents.  However that 
never happened. 
 
Because of these frustrations Chair we then resorted to 
Section 205 in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act and we subpoenaed 
General Sithole, General Vuma, General Zumani and the former 
Minister Mbalula’s advisor, Mr Bindwane.   When they were supposed to 
20 
hand over documents and come from interviews, because part of what 
we wanted to interview in relation to these investigations, then they 
went and challenged our 205 subpoena, and that is when then we 
opposed their challenge and did a counter application to force them to 
declassify these documents and hand them over to us, and we currently 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 124 of 182 
 
waiting for the Judge President to allocate a date for the matter to be 
heard. 
 
Now this is despite the fact that IPID Act Section 29 thereof, 
provides that the SAPS must assist us in terms of handing over 
documents that we need for the purpose of investigation or giving us 
statements and so forth and they refuse to do so.  Section 42 of the 
IPID Act provides that any State institution must cooperate with us to 
ensure that we are able to achieve our mandate, despite those legal 
imperatives they still refuse.   In fact when we receive their papers they 
are saying to us that it is only the Standing Committee on Intelligence 
10 
that can declassify documents, which is absurd.   We have got a policy 
document which is minimum information security standard, which 
provides how issues of classification must be dealt with and who can 
classify and who can declassify.  It is very clear that it is the person 
who classifies the document or the Head of the Institution which in this 
instance may be the National Commissioner or the Divisional 
Commissioner of Crime Intelligence, not the Standing Committee, but 
that is what they are saying in their papers, which we find 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do they refer to any legislation to support that as far 
20 
as you recall? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   I think they do, but it is in our view a 
misinterpretation of that legislation, because the legislation does not 
say that in an event the issue of declassification it is clear on the 
...[indistinct] how it must be handled and it was even dealt with in the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 125 of 182 
 
Constitutional judgment of Masetla and former President Thabo Mbeki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, in the Constitutional Court. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if they had – if they are – if on their knowledge 
only that committee could deal with it why didn’t they all these 
seven/eight years that Mr Roelofse, Colonel Roelofse has been asking 
for these documents why did they say you are coming to the wrong 
people, go to Parliament? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair that is obfuscation, there is nothing 
like that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Assuming that you are correct. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   In my humble opinion.   Yes and you right, 
assuming they are correct, that is what they should have done and if 
they were committed to doing it they should have written to the 
committee and say I did request these matters to be declassified to 
enable them to conduct investigation, can you please declassify them, 
and that has never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is difficult to understand also because 
Parliament is a different arm of the State, they are a different arm of 
the State. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Exactly.  And they are not involved in the 
operational issues of the SAPS, so you cannot expect Parliament to be 
dealing with classification or declassification of documents of the SAP.  
This is also Chair despite the advice from the Inspector General of 
Intelligence that the information that IPID is requesting has nothing to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 126 of 182 
 
do with the security of the State, it is all about procurement matters. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
Inspector 
General 
has 
actually 
advised 
...[intervenes] 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Has written and advised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they know about that. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   They know about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how long ago was that if you are able to 
remember? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   I think it was – it could be early this year 
or late last year. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   When we received those advice from the 
Inspector General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And their challenge when you subpoenaed them and 
your counter-application when did they – when were they launched, how 
far back? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair I am speaking under correction, it 
could be early this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It could be early this year? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes, or late last year. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so at this stage as far as you know all papers 
have been filed in court and all that remains is a date for hearing to be 
allocated? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes, yes, yes, as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the documents that you have been asking for, in 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 127 of 182 
 
other words which will be affected by the decision of the Court in that 
matter, would they cover almost all the document that Colonel Roelofse 
was looking for? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes it also includes those documents and 
other investigations 
CHAIRPERSON:  And other investigations. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That we are busy with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay so it may well be that – it may well be that 
relevant parties should make an approach to the Judge President to ask 
that the date be given as soon as possible because this is holding up 
10 
lots of investigations for years. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   That is correct Chair, the advice I got from 
my head of legal is that that is the position now, we are waiting for a 
court date to be allocated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that may be if at all possible the date should 
not be too far away, of course the Judge President you know looks at 
everything in his own court and so on but he probably if he – if 
representations are made to him and he is made to understand the 
impact of the delay in this investigation because of the non-
declassification he would make his decision from an informed position, 
20 
but part of what is concerning me, despite the fact that you say you are 
now waiting for a date for a hearing is that the date for hearing and the 
handing down of the judgment might not mean the end of the problem 
because if for argument sake the National Commissioner is successful 
or rather is unsuccessful and IPID succeeds they might seek to appear 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 128 of 182 
 
and then we could see another three years, if not more of a delay in 
regard to finalising these matters and by that time these documents 
that Colonel Roelofse started looking for in 2012 or 2011 I mean those 
cases would have been more than ten years old, and it is really an 
untenable situation. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Chair unfortunately in our environment 
these are kind of problems we are dealing with, unfortunately we do not 
investigate ordinary citizens, we investigate law enforcement officers 
who understand the criminal justice system and how it works and they 
can be able to manipulate it.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:  I mean this Pahlani investigation we 
conducted a search on one of the service providers, FDA and they 
challenged our search, we opposed, we went to court, the High Court 
found in our favour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   They petitioned the Supreme Court of 
Appeal, they failed twice there and now they’re saying they are taking it 
to the Constitutional Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   And they are – their arguments haven’t 
changed, so it is clear to us that it is to delay this as far as possible 
because what we have seized we cannot touch until these processes 
are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The litigation is finalised. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 129 of 182 
 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Are finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   And that perhaps on our ability to conclude 
these investigations, it is a similar thing with the classification, until 
such time that we get the documents we cannot finalise our 
investigation in these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think that if the executive wants to be seen to 
be meaning business about fighting corruption then they must be clear 
there must be clarity on when will they refuse to declassify and why 
would they refuse declassifying when it is said that the documents that 
10 
are being sought are being sought for purposes of investigation and the 
investigation relates to corruption among other things and with lots of 
money that has been lost through all of that, it is really a pity that this 
has been allowed to go on for so long.   There is a need for decisive 
action, there is a need for decisive action on the part of the executive, 
because in the end I mean courts get asked to deal with – some of the 
matters that courts get asked to deal with are matters that can be 
resolved by the leadership of the Executive, to say this is wrong, this is 
what must happen and it must happen, and those who don’t want to 
comply with lawful instructions must be dealt with. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    You know what is funny chair is that our 
Act as I have indicated Section 29 says it gives – it places an 
obligation on the police to cooperate with us in terms of giving us 
whatever information we need, for investigative purposes whether it be 
documents whether it be statements, whatever.  It does not make 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 130 of 182 
 
exception that only if it is not a classified document.  Our Act 
specifically provides that we must be vetted.  I hold a top secret 
clearance, there is a reason for that, so that I can have access to top 
secret information.   
 
Now even if they have classified if we all working in good faith 
they should make the documents available to me because I have top 
secret clearance, and then be able to raise whatever concerns they 
want to raise  with me in relation to the information contained there, as 
to which information can go to court, which information they believe 
should not go to court because it can affect State security and I am 
10 
sure we will amenable to listen to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so in other words when they know that IPID 
people have got, such as you, have got top secret clearance, security 
clearance, there is no reason why they cannot say okay come let us sit 
here, let us look at these documents.  We are concerned that these 
might be a problem if they get to be known publicly. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you can discuss and then you can look at 
those that might be no problem, you might be able to agree that these I 
agree, these I do not agree. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Exactly, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But even that does not take place? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    That does not take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    We had an opportunity Chair to go to the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 131 of 182 
 
UK to a similar institution like ours, IPCC, and to understand how they 
do their work and this issue also came up to say how do they deal with 
these issues.  They said no they get access to any document in 
possession of their Police Service, it does not matter whether it is 
classified or not classified, and they will make a determination which 
information can be exposed or not exposed based on those security 
considerations 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    So I am sure this is something that we 
could have done ourselves with the SAPS, and this document is very 
10 
clear that they cannot use classification to hide criminality in the SAPS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what Colonel Roelofse also emphasised 
last week. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    You know and we have thought that our 
work is trying to assist them to deal with issues of corruption in their 
environment.   Now denying us access to this and ability to be able to 
deal with this corruption it does not assist them either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    So then you have to ask yourself why they 
are refusing to give us this document.  Is it because senior members 
are suspects in these investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you.   On that topic further could you 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 132 of 182 
 
tell the Chair what happened pursuant to your Crime Intelligence 
Investigations when you raided the offices of a service provider and 
seized computers and documents?     
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    We – one of our investigations we went to 
a service provider’s premises and we seized documents and from after 
we seized the documents we analysed the information contained there 
and it was clear that there were meetings that were held between the 
service provider and senior officers in the SAPS.  In fact part of our 
Section 205 subpoenas was to try and get the senior police officers to 
be interviewed so that we can understand what their involvement was in 
10 
relation to the procurement that they wanted to do, and whether it was 
legitimate or not.  Now because of the fact that they challenged that we 
could not take these matters any further, so it is very concerning to us 
that there is this refusal to engage with us on these matters, and I am 
not in any way suggesting that they are guilty of anything, but for us to 
be able to come to a conclusion on investigation we need to get all the 
facts, and my expectation is that any senior officer who knows that he 
has done nothing wrong he should not have a problem engaging with us 
and telling us what were the circumstances surrounding the actions that 
he have taken at that point in time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well those who refuse to declassify you might not be 
accusing them of being guilty of anything but if they or some of them  
have been refusing to have – to declassify documents that are said to 
have nothing to do with the security of the State, that really relate to 
allegations of corruption and they have not been putting up any reason 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 133 of 182 
 
as to why these documents cannot be said to have been involved in 
allegations of corruption, it raises serious questions as to their motives 
for not declassifying and there may well have to be investigation as to 
whether such motives as they may have are not of a criminal nature. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Mr Sesoko you said that 
you had to get an interdict to stop the Mbula team interfering with our 
investigations, and if you just have regard to paragraph 65 I would just 
like you to tell the Chair what happened notwithstanding the fact that 
10 
you had an interdict against the Mbula team after that. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Chair after we go to the interdict and the 
Judge was very clear also that the SAPS management must make an 
undertaking that they will remove this team from the investigating 
house which undertaking they made, but subsequent to that it must 
have been a month or so later, if not two months later I was approached 
by one of my investigators, Mr Mhlango, and he came to me with a 
recording on his cell phone from the very same Brigadier Gomo, who 
was in the IPID and Brigadier Gomo was essentially telling Mr Mhlango 
that he must implicate us, the management and the N City team in 
20 
wrongdoing in exchange for that then he will get a brigadier position in 
the SAPS.    
 
Now if that is not gratification I do not know what gratification 
is.    
 
Now after I got this information Mr Mhlango also said that in 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 134 of 182 
 
fact Brigadier Gomo had said to him they must meet with General 
Mbula, which they did in Potchefstroom and Mr Mhlango also recorded 
that meeting where the discussion was exactly around this issue, that 
they must implicate us.   In fact they also discussed about a prosecutor 
who will then prepare a statement for Mr Mhlango which can be used 
against us.   
 
Now this is despite the fact that there is an order that says 
they must not get involved, they must not interfere, that is how brazen 
these officers were.   
 
Now subsequent to us learning about this we called a meeting 
10 
with the entire team, because now we are aware that there are these 
approaches and in that meeting ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The entire team being your team? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   The ...[indistinct] team, my team yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    In that team we then asked them to 
disclose if they have been approached in the similar way as we have 
learnt about Mr Mhlango and only Mr Mhlango indicated that he has 
been approached, the rest of the team said they were never 
approached.   However in the recording Mr Gomo is heard saying that 
20 
one of our investigators, Mr Ngabinde has already agreed to work with 
them against us, and in the meeting Mr Ngabinde does not say 
anything.  After we adjourned the meeting, it could have been the 
following day I wrote to Mr Ngabinde and informed him that I am 
removing him from the team because we cannot trust him anymore.  He 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 135 of 182 
 
is originally from the KwaZulu Natal office and I said he must go back 
to the office of KwaZulu Natal.    
 
He wrote to the Executive Director and said that he should not 
appoint either myself or Mr Khuba to investigate these allegations of 
approached alleging impropriety on our part.   Mr McBride wrote back 
to him and said if you have evidence that Sesoko and Khuba have 
conducted themselves in an unlawful manner provide me with that 
evidence then I will deal with it.  None of that came forth. 
 
We registered a criminal investigation of corruption against the 
Mbula team including our own Mr Ngabinde for investigation.  We also 
10 
started with disciplinary processes against him, in fact we suspended 
him and then subsequently we held a disciplinary hearing, or we were 
supposed to hold a disciplinary hearing, it never materialised because 
he offered through his attorneys that he will resign and offered that we 
make a settlement with him, which we did. 
 
He also made complaints against us with the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Alleging wrongdoing against us in relation 
20 
to appointments and procurement issues.   Now these allegations were 
nog coming for the first time, because these allegations before then 
were sent to the Public Service Commission, and the Public Service 
Commission investigated those allegations and found them to be 
unsubstantiated, but they were now rehashed with the office of the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 136 of 182 
 
Public Protector. 
 
In my view the Public Protector’s office was now being 
weaponised against us.  Now this is what we have been experiencing 
all along, that there is this fight back campaign against us so that it 
derails all these investigations that we were conducting. 
 
Now recently there is a report that was issued by the Public 
Protector which makes findings against us, myself, Mr McBride, Mr 
Khuba, Mr Nomkonsi, Siyanda, head of our corporate services, Ms 
Motlale and Ms Moroasui, head of legal, it is almost the entire 
management if IPID. 
10 
 
Now it is a separate matter, we are going to deal with it, we 
are clear that we do not agree with those findings, we are going to take 
on review and interdict them, but that is the kind of situation that we 
find ourselves in, there must always be something.   
 
I have been subjected to investigation and I mean people in 
the police tell me that you know they want to get something on you, you 
know I talked to my banker that time, my banker says what have you 
done, the police are looking for your financial information, what have 
you done.  So that is the kind of situation we find ourselves in.  In my 
view it is a push-back because we dared to investigate those that are 
20 
supposed to be investigated. 
 
So that is the situation we find ourselves in Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must be a very difficult environment to work in. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    It certainly is, it certainly is, it is 
continuous push-back. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 137 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, and this is happening even in 2019? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Even now as I have indicated in my view I 
believe that the Office of the Public Protector has weaponised against 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm.   Yes, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Could you just give the Chair an idea when 
that Public Protector’s report came out? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    The Public Protector’s report was actually 
leaked.  I first became aware of it from our investigators, because it 
was doing the rounds on Whatsapp, it was leaked also to the media, but 
10 
us as people who was ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is before it was officially released? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Yes, people who are implicated we have 
not received it officially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:    Actually it was only received by our 
lawyers on the 19 t h I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last week? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Ja, no, no, no, today is – on Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Monday? 
20 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   On Monday, and it was already making 
rounds from the 18 t h, and ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was now in the social media? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   We understand from our lawyers that they 
have already been receiving media enquiries about it. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 138 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And Mr Sesoko did the Public Protector 
interview you? 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Yes I was interviewed by the Public 
Protector. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair I have no further questions, that 
concludes the evidence of Mr Sesoko, unless you have further 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I do not have any further questions also but 
you will remember some of the things that I have asked you to – some 
10 
homework, and assistance that I have asked you to give to the 
investigators and the Legal Team, that is yourself, Mr McBride and Mr 
Khuba.  Please do that but other than that I must thank you for coming 
forward to give evidence.  I will continue to hear evidence and I will 
hear evidence from also those against whom evidence has been given 
relating to unlawful conduct or inappropriate conduct or misconduct but 
if indeed in the end what you have told me about the struggles that you 
have said you have had for standing for the right things, to make sure 
the right things are done, which really would be very unfortunately but 
we have to establish what the true position is so that the Commission 
20 
at the end can say this is what happens, can make findings and then 
say, make recommendations as to what measures should be put in 
place to make sure that these things do not happen again, to make sure 
that with regard to IPID where IPID personnel are investigating, making 
investigations, they are not hindered instead they are assisted to do 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 139 of 182 
 
their job in accordance with the requirements of the law and where any 
other officials within the law enforcement agencies believe that they 
should not give assistance they state that upfront and give reasons so 
that those can evaluated and if need be even more senior people within 
the Executive must be approached to try and resolve it and the courts 
are really approached when there is no other way. 
 
But sometimes you just need proper leadership that will stand 
firm on what is right and what is wrong and get things sorted out and 
things can be sorted out without going to court, it is just an 
unacceptable situation where within effectively the same organisation 
10 
things cannot be sorted out, but of course those situations can arise 
and when they arise you might have no option but to go to Court and try 
and get assistance because sometimes the Courts are the only places 
of refuge and places where the right decisions will be made to make 
sure that things are done in accordance with the law. 
 
But thank you very much for having come to give evidence, 
and probably you may be asked to come back on other matters that you 
have touched on but thank you very much for coming. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Thank you Chair, and I pledge that we will 
assist the Commission in any way we can to make sure that it discharge 
20 
its mandate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   But also we hope that the work of the 
Commission will assist us as public servants so that when you do your 
work with integrity and stand firm for the truth it is not ...[indistinct]. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 140 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, no thank you we certainly, I certainly 
hope that recommendations that we will make in the end must be able 
to show that as a country we appreciate the work of those who stand 
for what is right and who wants to do their job in the right way and who 
do not want to do wrong things, so we hope that the recommendations 
we will make will facilitate that, but thank you very much, you are 
excused. 
MR MATTHEWS SESOKO:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Wentzel, are you ready with Mr Khuba? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I am ready, if I could just have a fifteen 
10 
minute or five minute break just to regroup and get my files together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, we might not have a lot of time but I 
think we must use whatever time we have. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So shall I give you what, ten minutes, five minutes? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten or five? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Ten please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ten, okay, we will adjourn and we will resume at ten 
to four. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 141 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   The next witness is a witness… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Switch on your microphone. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your next witness is Mr Innocent Khuba. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  My name is Humbulani Innocent 
Khuba. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Before you start Ms Wentzel. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We took longer than we hoped we would with Mr 
Sesoko and tomorrow we will not be able to start at half past nine with 
regard to the – with regard to the application for an order that Colonel 
Naidoo’s evidence be heard in camera. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 142 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because another urgent meeting has arisen that I 
must attend to relating to commission work. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the morning and that would mean we are not able – 
also able to start at ten to continue with Mr Khuba’s evidence because 
we will not finish today.  So I think that if it is fine with you and with Mr 
Khuba we should continue beyond four o’clock up to five to try and 
make sure that whatever is left for tomorrow at least we have covered 
some – some ground.  Is that fine with you? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes – Yes Chair that is perfectly suitable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Khuba would that be fine with you? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is fine with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine with you.  Okay.  Thank you.  Let us 
continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba you have provided an affidavit to 
the commission, is that correct? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you have a look at the bundle in front you is 
that your affidavit marked pages 2 to 36?  Can you see it actually says 
20 
HIK2 – 002. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is my affidavit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair if I might submit that into evidence 
marked Y4.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the affidavit I have you said his affidavit goes up 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 143 of 182 
 
to page 35 but … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Page 36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it goes up – the one I have goes up to 27. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To 27?   
CHAIRPERSON:  27 of his affidavit and 28 of the paginated papers. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair mine goes up to 36.  Perhaps if we 
could just stand down for two minutes so I can see what is – what has 
gone wrong here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not have somebody who might have the extra 
pages then we do not have to stand down you can just give me the 
10 
extra pages? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the pages that I do not have start at page 29 if 
you look at the paginated pages otherwise page 28 of the affidavit 
itself.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise Chair I am not sure how that 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before we do that let us complete that.  Mr Khuba 
pages 2 of the bundle that is now if you look at the red numbers on the 
top right hand it is page 2 which is page 1 of your affidavit.  Most of the 
20 
time when she refers to page numbers she will be referring to the red 
numbers and she will not mention the letters and 00 she will just say 
page 1, page 2, page 3 and so on.  Okay.  Now from page 2 up to page 
35 of the red numbers, the paginated pages or rather 36 that is where 
the commissioner’s signature is.  Is that your affidavit? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 144 of 182 
 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes it is my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and are the contents of that affidavit true and 
correct to the best your knowledge and belief? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. The lever arch file containing Mr 
Khuba’s affidavit and annexures will be marked Exhibit Y4.  Yes you 
can start then. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair if it could be marked Y4.1 because 
there was an annexure that was omitted and a supplementary affidavit 
is being prepared and I would like to put that document in as Exhibit  
10 
marked Y4.2.  So the main affidavit will be Y4.1 and the supplementary 
will be Y4.2 if that is convenient to you Chair/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us do that now.  So this lever arch file 
containing Mr Khuba’s affidavit will be marked Exhibit Y4.1.  Just 
arrange for a market to be used later on to… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mark it.  Okay thank you.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba if you have a look right at end of 
the bundle at page 376 up until 379 is that the supplementary affidavit 
that you deposed to? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is after the divider marked B. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay.  That is correct it is mine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you and you confirm that is true and 
correct? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 145 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. Mr Khuba … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms – Ms Wentzel you know Mr Sesoko referred to in 
his evidence to Mr Mhlongo I think he said Mhlongo who he said had a 
recording of Brigadier Gomo asking him or them to implicate Mr Sesoko 
I think and Mr McBride in some wrongdoing.  I think when Mr McBride 
gave his evidence earlier this year he did mention that.  What I cannot 
remember is whether that recording was made available to the 
commission and whether I have listened to it or not.  Just check that so 
that if it has not been made available or it has been made available but 
it has not been played in the open hearing then that should – so that 
10 
that can be done in due course.  But also I wanted to find out whether 
there were plans in place to call Mr Mhlongo who had had that 
discussion with Brigadier Gomo? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No not as yet.  But I will make arrangements 
to consult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well those plans should have been made – that 
should have been part of the plan even before you came on board. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that evidence was given in I think it was 
April or March and there should by now have been a statement from Mr 
20 
Mhlongo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also there must be an identification of certain 
people in the evidence of Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko, Mr Khuba in relation 
to various events and incidents.  There must be an identification of 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 146 of 182 
 
certain people who must be issued with a Regulation 10 – Regulation 
10.6 Directives calling upon them to file affidavits dealing with 
allegations that have been made against them.  But also there should 
be a plan to make sure those people can be called to give evidence 
that includes Mr Kgamanyane who was acting Executive Director when 
Mr… 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride was on suspension but also this – this 
team from North West that Mr Sesoko talked about that … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The Mabula team. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He alleged was inferring with their investigations you 
know those people must be given a chance to respond to the 
allegations and must be able to be called to give evidence.  And also 
the various National Commissioners of Police who have refused to 
declassify documents, Acting Commissioners and whoever Regulation 
10.6 Directives have to be issued for them to respond to the allegations 
and ultimately to come and give evidence.  So share that with the legal 
team. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that steps can be taken. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes I will attend to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba could you tell the Chair the history 
of your employment at IPID? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before just the history of employment at 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 147 of 182 
 
IPID you could just take a few seconds to talk about yourself?  What is 
your back – what was your background before you came to IPID and so 
on? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you.  I joined the IPID in 
1999 if I remember very well it was 1 s t January and before that I was 
with Anglo American where I was conducting investigation in gold theft. 
So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In what theft? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Theft of gold. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Gold? 
10 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja I used to work closely with 
the gold and diamond branch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In Springs Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ham.  Is that branch of the police? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I joined the ICD on a rank of an 
Assistant 
Director 
where 
I 
was 
responsible 
investigation 
and 
supervising investigators.  In the year 2000 I was then requested to 
20 
extend my services to Free State which by then was not having a 
Provincial office established.  So I was given two members of SAPS to 
supervise while I was still responsible for Northern Cape.  Then 
towards the end of 2000 that is when I was appointed Acting Head of 
the Province Northern Cape. Because the person who was my direct 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 148 of 182 
 
supervisor was a Provincial Head had been moved to Free State to 
establish the office there because statistically it was generating more 
cases than Northern Cape.  So I remained responsible for Northern 
Cape and 2001 I was appointed as now a Provincial Head but not for 
Northern Cape but for Limpopo Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was now before IPID was established? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Before IPID it was still ICD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were with the predecessor of IPID the 
organisation what it was called before? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was called ICD. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am saying you were with that organisation at 
the time? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So 2003 while I was the 
Provincial Head for Limpopo they requested me to go and manage 
Mpumalanga office.  By that time it was established but the Provincial 
Head there seemingly left and I was the one responsible supervising 
two provinces.  So I used to do it on a weekly basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is what year now? 
20 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  2003. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay still under ICD? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Still under ICD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did ICD mean – stand for again or you have got 
it here Independent Complaints Directorate. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 149 of 182 
 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Independent Complaints 
CHAIRPERSON:  Directorate. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Directorate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was Limpopo and Northern Cape?  Or which 
Provinces were you responsible for now? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was responsible for Limpopo 
and Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  During – when I was he 
Provincial Head I was on a Deputy Director level.  Then on the 1 s t July 
2007 that is when I was promoted to a director level but still having the 
same responsibilities as Provincial Head.  In 2011 I was transferred to 
KZN for six months where I was requested to set up the office.  
Because by that time the office was battling to meet strategic 
objectives of the department.  So I was requesting – requested to go 
and set up systems and also try to assist the office to achieve strategic 
objectives.  Then at the beginning of 2012 after I had already returned 
to Limpopo I was requested to head the task team called the Cato 
20 
Manor Task Team where we were investigating the so called the Death 
Squad.  I was given members from various provinces but it was 
predominantly investigators from North West.  Then after that I was 
threatened and when I was threatened I still remember they did 
threaten [indistinct] they sent people of the SSA by that time it used to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 150 of 182 
 
be called NIA – National Intelligent Agency.  They came and they did 
assessment and they told me because they visited me at the hotel at 
night and they told me that you have to leave.  The following day I think 
I got the earliest flight and I left.  I still remember I left the car there.  
Now when I came back… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You say as soon as you left?  You left the 
first flight the following morning. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was the first flight I 
had to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  After they had notified you the previous night? 
10 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say you have to leave? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the … 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The threats were real. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The threats were real. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is to kill you? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Hm. 
20 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I left went back to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they indicate where the threats came from? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The – there was an indication 
that there was – they got information from a guy who was belonging to 
a taxi association who was requested to shoot me but he had some 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 151 of 182 
 
reservations and he informed them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm   And was that connected with your work? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was connected with my work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I then left and then when I was 
back in Limpopo then that is when I was told that I am going to be 
dealing with a rendition.  That was 2012 I was appointed to investigate 
rendition.  But before that rendition I was requested to investigate 
allegations which raised by a parliamentary member against General 
Sibiya.  Then I assembled a very small team and then I investigated the 
10 
allegation.  I provided a report and the matter were concluded.  And 
then shortly after that that is when I was appointed to investigate 
illegal rendition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – the allegations against General Sibiya that you 
investigated after you made your report – your report would have gone 
to who?  Who did you submit it to? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I sent to a report to the DPP 
Gauteng because those cases it was not only a one case – it were a 
number of cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Against him? 
20 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Against him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Including assault I think the 
majority was assault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 152 of 182 
 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then one of the case which I 
remember very well which was Boksburg case.  It was already 
investigated by our Gauteng office and the report had already been 
produced and sent to DPP and the DPP declined to prosecute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the report was saying prosecute? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No it was saying… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it did not ja. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was not recommending 
prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I took over the investigation 
and identified a number of discrepancies in that investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I found that there witnesses 
who were not contactable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Interviewed? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja were not interviewed.  Some 
of the people were treated as witnesses whereas they were suspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did an investigation and after 
20 
that a report was done which could have meant that it was a second 
report for the department but it was the first report from me.  Now when 
I sent that report I still remember I had consultation with Advocate – 
the Head of the DPP as well as the prosecutor who was assigned to 
deal with the case.  And they said okay you can do us a favour.  We 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 153 of 182 
 
saw your report.  We look at the additional evidence that you got.  Give 
us the chance to consult with all the witnesses.  I made that 
arrangement.  They consult with the witnesses and finally they wrote 
back to me.  They say despite having acquired additional evidence we 
are still of the view as NPA – as NPA that there is no prospects of 
successful prosecution.  Then I got that information I related the 
information to the complainant and also because I had a discussion 
with him and I said because the complainant was a person who was just 
keep on calling me now and then also indicate to him what would be the 
avenue if you decided not to prosecute.  And they wrote there to say to 
10 
him you can pursue private prosecution. I then wrote a letter to the 
complainant and I wrote a letter to General Sibiya to say that I 
investigated a case against you please be informed that the DPP 
declined to prosecute.  And that is when it was concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you explain to the Chair how it was that 
you came to be involved in the Rendition investigation? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Rendition investigation I 
was informed earlier that I would investigate the case but at the time I 
did not have facts – enough facts in terms of what really happened.  
20 
Because I remember there was a meeting where we met with the 
Secretary of Police Jenni Qhobosheane had a discussion and in the 
meeting that is where she indicated that the Minister would want you to 
investigate it but for now he wants you to hold off.  That particular day 
we did not get any documents or any docket for investigation. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 154 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this would have been around 2011? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In my – my statement – because 
I checked my records and there has been a little bit conflicting in my 
records because normally I would not rely on memory I will check – I 
remember there was a trip that I took around July 2012 where I 
indicated specifically purpose of the meeting.  But that is a meeting 
that I took as if the meeting where we met with Qhobosheane about the 
– the event. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your – is your position that you think it must have 
been around mid-2012 when you met with Ms Qhobosheane? 
10 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is the record that I took 
from the travel claims that I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because Mr Sesoko if I recall correctly thought 
that you were – the first time that he became aware that the Minister 
wanted some investigation to be done in relation to the so called 
Rendition but said that – or they were told that they had to hold on until 
further notice from the Minister.  He thought that must have been 
around – towards the end of 2011.  You are not sure? 
20 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I never relied on my recollection 
when I put the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I relied on the information that I 
wrote with my travel [indistinct]. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 155 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I know that I had numerous 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  With also Qhobosheane 
because there was a time when I went there.  I think she also wanted 
me to just speak to her about how the investigation was going.  But this 
one in the trip authority that I did it was kind of really revolving around.  
And I was aware of the information that it could have been 20 – but the 
point of the matter is that I need to put what I can beg one eye can 
10 
see.\ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would be more inclined to think it was around 
mid-year 2012? 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what the happened according to your 
statement on the 23 r d October 2012?  If you have regard to paragraph 
13 on page 4. 
20 
MR  HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is when Mr Sesoko 
informed me that he had received instruction from the Executive 
Director that now that case needs to be investigated.  By that time the 
former Executive Director that is Francois Beukman had already left the 
department and the person who was acting in his place was Ms Koekie 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 156 of 182 
 
Mbeki.  So he appoint – handed to me an appointment letter and the 
docket which after that I perused.  The case number was Diepsloot 
390/7/2012.  And upon my perusal of the docket because I wanted to 
check the work which was done I realised that there were almost 
thirteen statements.  Most of these statements were from Crime 
Intelligent members and members of the family of the alleged deported 
individual.  So I was also requested to assemble the team and because 
I was well acquainted with my staff I had to source the capacity from 
my office.  Then I chose Mr Maphetho, Mr Mulaudzi, Mr Mashaphu and 
Mr Ratshitali to assist me.   
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Before we move on.  You will see that the 
case number of the docket was Diepsloot.  Was there something written 
on the outside of that docket which was of interest to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The case 
number was Diepsloot but on top there was a case number Itwatwa.  So 
I had an engagement with Colonel Moukangwe after my perusal.  We 
had our meeting at Emperors Place and I wanted to find out why I need 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Emperors Place here in Gauteng? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I wanted to find out why there 
are two case numbers and different stations and that is when he told 
me that they had to register it at Itwatwa on the basis that they were 
afraid that if they could register it at Diepsloot before any investigation 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 157 of 182 
 
is done it will raise some red flags and probably those people who are 
investigated would be able to interfere with witnesses or try to interfere 
with the investigation.  So it was just done for concealment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is Itwatwa a police station in Limpopo - one of 
the police stations in Limpopo? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is Itwatwa?  Does it refer to any police 
station? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I was made to understand 
is that Itwatwa is the police station around Gauteng not in Limpopo. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not in Limpopo? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have no idea where that - where that police 
station is? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know if it actually exists or not? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did not even check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you explain to the Chair who you were 
requested to deal with in this investigation and who you were requested 
20 
to exclude from the investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then when I commenced with my 
- my work the then Acting Executive Director Ms Koekie Mbeki gave me 
an instruction verbally to say that I need to work with Moukangwe whom 
I understood was the initial investigator on the basis number of 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 158 of 182 
 
statements had been commissioned I think by him or he was part of that 
investigation but in that instruction to work with him it came with a lead 
to say keep his involvement secret and I had some concerns about that. 
On the basis that my perusal of the docket was not merely to 
check number of statement per se.  It involved reading the content of 
each and every statement and I still remember I had a paper where I 
was scribbling every - to check what was going on per statement what 
type of leads I was going to find.  Then I realised that a number of 
people who were involved in this rendition process were also CI 
members. 
10 
So I thought that there was some level of conflict there 
because they were involved in this rendition or deportation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now CI being Crime Intelligence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Colonel Moukangwe was a member of the Crime 
Intelligence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay; and if there were 13 statements already 
in the file when you - when it was handed over to you that seems to 
suggest to me that substantial work had been done? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  One could say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Unless if one goes to the 
content of the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 159 of 182 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The family member statements 
obviously would talk to the issue of when the police came and arrested 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Or when did they lastly saw their 
loved ones … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the members of the police 
statements talk to the - when they arrested these people that 
General Sibiya was there to an extent that even two of the Zimbabwean 
10 
Nationals who were at the time when I took over the investigation were 
under witness protection.  In their statements they were alleging that 
General Sibiya was there. 
He was wearing a suit.  Some of the members of CI they were 
saying we saw a figure seated in a BMW … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
And 
I 
was 
that 
was 
General Sibiya.  So the investigation was - it spoke also about the 
issue of the money which was stolen but it could not really have - it did 
not corroboration much but it was just - it was more of an allegation. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you later try and involve your boss 
essentially Mr Sesoko in this investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I was told that I should 
keep Colonel Moukangwe’s involvement a secret I indicated to 
Ms Koekie Mbeki that I will be involving Mr Sesoko in this investigation 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 160 of 182 
 
because my experience has always told me that normally when I do an 
investigation I do not report to the head of the department.  I report to 
the direct supervisor who then reports to the Executive Director 
depending on the level. 
Now when you say that she categorically indicated to me that 
Mr Sesoko shall not be involved and because Mr Sesoko was not 
merely a National Head of Investigation.  He was my Supervisor.  I then 
went to him and informed him about these people and I did so because 
I wanted his view and he said to me she is the Head of the Department.  
If she says you must not involve me do not involve me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel I take it that both Mr Sesoko’s statement 
or relevant portions thereof and Mr Khuba’s statement at least the 
relevant 
portions 
thereof 
that 
affect 
Ms Koekie Mbeki 
- 
Ms Koekie Mbeki were sent to her … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it that there has been no response? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that something you know?  Is there something you 
do not know? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There have been one or two responses that - 
20 
and I have received one late last night and I want to check who it came 
from because I think it might be her attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Apparently the one I am referring to was not 
from her attorneys but the - the Rule 3.3 was sent to her timeously. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 161 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think plans must be put in place for Regulation 
10.6 directive in regard to her as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that she can be directed to file an affidavit dealing 
with these allegations. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will attend to that as well.  Now you say in 
your statement after having had this conversation with Mr Sesoko you 
continued to investigate the case without Mr Sesoko’s involvement and 
10 
you kept Colonel Moukangwe apprised of the situation.  Can you just 
tell the Chair about your dealings with Colonel Moukangwe?  Where you 
would meet?  Which email addresses you were asked to use? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Colonel Moukangwe’s 
involvement in my investigation there were times when he was part of 
the interviews that I did.  He was part of meetings that I had with the 
prosecutors who were guiding the case.  We were sharing every part of 
the docket but that was after I requested the then Acting Executive 
Director whether I should be able to give him - if he requests - 
documents and I was told that he is a member of the team. 
20 
You can share him with anything.  The only thing that I have 
to do was to keep his involvement secret.  So there were times that I 
would give him a call and tell him that I got certain information and he 
had been very instrumental because with his experience in the SAPS.  
Sometimes when I would have some challenges I would tell him to say I 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 162 of 182 
 
have a problem I cannot get one, two, three individuals and with no 
time he will just come back to me and say use this channel you will be 
able to get hold of them. 
Now when I gave him progress sometimes he would request 
me to email things.  The first mail - email that he gave me was 
botsotsomoukangwe@gmail.com.  So I used to - to send any document 
any statement to - to him but when I started to be able to get serious 
information.  I am saying serious on the basis that it implicated senior 
people.  He gave me a new email address. 
It was june16@gmail.com but it gave me suspicion because 
10 
the botsotosmoukangwe@gmail.com email I would email from my laptop 
because I had 3G.  At anywhere I could open my emails and attach it or 
email something or information.  Even though sometimes I would have 
to go to the office to scan the document into my email. 
Now when he gave me that email he categorically indicated 
that I should not use the official email and he advised me to use an 
email or the facility at Southern Sun where I used to stay while I was 
investigating the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is that southern - Southern Sun Hotel? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  In Pretoria. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Pretoria? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The email address that you had used before he gave 
you the one which you said was june16@gmail.com or whatever. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 163 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that his official address - the first one that you 
were using? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No.  I am not really sure but 
what I was aware of is that the Crime Intelligence people normally they 
use - mostly they do not use official emails.  It is - it is Gmail or Yahoo 
or it is - but not - I - I have never experienced someone who would say 
send me; so the one he gave it is Botsotso I was more comfortable 
because 
I 
used 
to 
call 
him 
- 
he 
told 
me 
that 
his 
name 
Botsotso Moukangwe. 
So it - the first name I was somehow given assurance by the 
10 
mere glance at the email to say it is his. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That it was his? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You became concerned when he gave you the 
june16@gmail.com one and said do not use the other one or do not use 
his official email? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  More especially when June, the 
16 t h is a … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It has some political connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after you met Colonel Moukangwe you 
say in paragraph 20 of your statement he instructed you to work with 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 164 of 182 
 
two 
advocates 
from 
the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority.  
Advocates Mosing and Moletsi.  What reason was given to you for that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He told me that these are people 
who had been guiding this investigation.  Which means while he was 
investigating the case he was consulting with them. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And you say in paragraph 26 on page 7 that: 
“Advocate Mosing was for some reason extremely 
keen to finalise the rendition investigation and put 
pressure on you to prioritise the investigation.” 
Could you just expand on that? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The - when I was doing this 
investigation I was on dual roles.  I was still responsible for Limpopo 
and on the other hand I had to investigate the case.  So I would 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had - had you ceased to be also responsible for 
Mpumalanga? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  By that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or were you …? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had already ceased long time 
ago. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I had a challenge because 
when I went back to the office I had to check the work done.  Making 
sure that the office is performing well.  There was one time I still 
remember I got an email where he was saying that when are we going 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 165 of 182 
 
to finalise this thing and I told him that I - there is an unrest at 
(indistinct) around Tzaneen. 
So I cannot leave the situation like this because the 
Provincial Commissioner wanted me to go there and assist in calming 
down the situation.  He was really keen to get these things submitted or 
finalised. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You were based in Limpopo.  Did you 
frequently come and consult with him in Pretoria? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We - I consulted with him so 
manier times that I cannot remember how many and it will be very rare 
10 
to come and do investigation and not end up visiting him at the office. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what happened on one occasion when 
you were consulting with him and Ms Mbeki saw you there? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was a time when I was 
busy trying to draft the 205 applications and I went to our Head Office.  
I received a call from the Personal Assistant of Ms Mbeki who said to 
me that the Acting Executive Director had seen you around here and 
she gave me a message to tell you that you are here on your own.  I 
will not pay for your accommodation. 
I will not pay for your travel cost.  You need to see how you 
20 
cover those expenses because you did not tell me that you are coming 
for investigation in Pretoria.  I had a challenge with that because the 
previous week on Friday I had already sent the weekly work plan which 
spell out my activities for the following week and as usual she would 
not comment on weekly work plan and every Provincial Head knew that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 166 of 182 
 
when you send your weekly work plan and you do not get feedback it 
means it is alright you can continue. 
So I was surprised when I was queried on that.  Then I 
decided that I need to formalise this because it was communicated to 
me telephonically and then I send an email to her which I am going to 
just read because I - I paraphrased it here.  I sent it on 5 July 2013.  I 
said … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I think you mean paragraph 27. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Oh paragraph 27.  Sorry.  Ja.  
So in that email I indicated that please give me an opportunity to be 
10 
able to do this work I do not have a problem in covering my cost for 
accommodation and even if you do not pay me for travel costs.  I am 
still fine.  I then arranged with my uncle - because I felt that on the 
other side I am getting pressure that I finalise this.  On the other 
pressure I am being told you cannot really come here. 
You were supposed to talk to me but I had already sent the 
weekly work plan.  So I then phoned my uncle and I said can I get 
accommodation for tonight.  Then he said it was okay.  I drove.  Then I 
arranged private accommodation and after that I continued. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then what happened when Mr Mosing wanted 
20 
you to come again? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
Then 
after 
that 
incident 
Advocate Mosing requested me to come to Pretoria.  Then I told him I 
said no I cannot come.  You need to talk to my boss first because the 
last time I came there she had some issues with it and then I requested 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 167 of 182 
 
him to send an email where he cc’d me.  The email was sent on 
5 July 2013.  That is where he said: 
“Dear Ms Mbeki, I confirm that I met with Mr Khuba 
this week where we discussed progress of this 
matter.  I am instructed by my principal to draw up 
charge sheets.  I am in the progress to do so.  
There are however certain investigations discussed 
with Mr Khuba that requires speedy attention.  The 
plan is to wrap up this investigation without delay 
and we agreed that he devotes the whole next week 
10 
for this purpose.  If not possible to complete the 
charge sheet when there are issues out - sorry.  It 
is not possible to complete the charge sheet when 
there are issues outstanding.  I trust that you will 
give him the necessary permission/support to 
finalise this especially now that very important new 
statements were obtain this week.  I trust that you 
will 
find 
this 
in 
order, 
kind 
regard 
Advocate Mosing.” 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair you will find that letter - it is Annexure 
20 
HIK2 at page 44.  Now what did you notice about the contents of this 
email?  Was it cc’d to you - this email? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What did you notice about it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The one thing that stand - stand 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 168 of 182 
 
out from this email for me is that it shows that I was not the only 
person who was getting pressure from - it shows that the pressure I 
was getting was as a result of the pressure he was getting.  So - 
because he says I am getting pressure from my seniors. 
So which mean the pressure which I was getting was as a 
result of the pressure which he was getting.  The other thing is that he 
made mention of the charge sheet and for me it is something that 
raises eyebrows.  When you have outstanding investigation yet you 
want to do the - the charge sheet. 
Unless if that such outstanding investigation or whatever 
10 
evidentiary material you need it is one sided.  It is only to support your 
version.  It cannot contradict but in the investigation I have learnt that 
you can be surprised when something that you thought it is in a 
particular way but you get something that contradicts that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your point that it was strange that he had 
already made up his mind that there would be a charge sheet?  So in 
other words they would charge somebody and yet the investigation was 
not complete. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now Mr Khuba what were the important new 
statements that had been obtained that week that were referred to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The new statements which he 
referred to were the statements which were obtained from members of 
Crime Intelligence and these are the statements which people who were 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 169 of 182 
 
involved in the arrest of these Zimbabwean Nationals deposed and 
indicated that when they arrest one of the wanted person they took him 
to Silverton where the Hawks Offices are and when they were there that 
is when they saw General Dramat and General - General Dramat and 
the spokesperson of the Hawks by then who was McIntosh Polela. 
Now by that time I had obtained a number of statements 
which point to - there were three members of Crime Intelligence but 
when they did their operation they were assisted by TRT members.  So 
they took this person together with TRT members to Silverton but of 
these statements that I obtained it was only the - the Crime Intelligence 
10 
members 
who 
said 
when 
they 
were 
with 
the 
person 
there 
General Dramat came and he came with the spokesperson and he 
thanked them for the work well done and he was coming from house 
number three to house number one. 
Now that information seems to be very crucial but when I 
went to the other part of - the people were there because they did a 
braai there.  They eat - they were there.  When I went to the other part 
all TRT members none of them remembered this.  They say no there 
was no such.  Now that created a problem for me to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were saying General Dramat had not been 
20 
involved? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  They said they - they said 
they did not see General - it was only CI members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who said they saw him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They saw him. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 170 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or were told he was there? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  They say he came with the 
spokesperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And they said he thanked them 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he looked at this guy who 
was arrested about to be deported - illegal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And after that he left but when I 
interviewed the TRT member which the number of the TRT number was 
greater than the number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the Crime Intelligence people? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of the Crime Intelligence I - 
none of them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Could ever mention - they 
mentioned everything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Except the issue of Dramat 
going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I felt okay it is fine.  I went 
and … 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 171 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well tell me a little bit about the numbers.  You say 
the one group was - their number was greater than the other.  What - 
what numbers are we talking about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember out of my 
head but it was around five to - five to seven.  Somewhere there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And the CI were only three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But all the CI ones said he came? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the other ones said we never saw him? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I then took the investigation 
a little further to say I have to speak with the spokesperson because 
these CI members are saying that they saw him together with 
General Dramat but when I approached him I obtained a statement from 
him.  He said he never - that never happened and I am talking about a 
person whom at the time when I interviewed him he was fired from the 
Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was no longer working.  It 
was almost a month or three months or four months after he was 
dismissed.  So I was expecting a person who would spill the beans and 
he said no.  He gave me information pertaining to the meetings that had 
happened between General Dramat and the Zimbabweans but that 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 172 of 182 
 
information never related to the meeting which - the questionable 
meeting which took place on 5 November because he himself joined the 
Hawks in December not in November. 
So it means that it was another meeting not the questionable 
one which I was investigating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the November and December that you are 
referring to are for which year? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm I cannot remember, I just 
need to check but if it is not 2010 it is 2011 somewhere there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Now you say that a key witness in the 
investigation was Colonel Madilonga, can you just explain why he was a 
key witness and what happened with his statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   The key witness Mr – Colonel 
Madilonga unfortunately he is late now, he deposed a statement and in 
that statement he was the first person before the CI members to 
implicate General Dramat.  He said he received a call from Maluleke, 
he laid the whole background in terms of where it started, but he said 
one day while he was working at the border he saw the – some vehicle 
20 
that seemed to be vehicles of diplomats and then he went there and he 
was told these are Zimbabwean police and they are looking to enter the 
country in order to see General Dramat, so in his statement he said he 
called General Dramat but firstly before he called General Dramat he 
spoke with his superiors to get permission and the superiors told him 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 173 of 182 
 
that they did not know of anything that he needs to all General Dramat 
himself.   
 
So he called General Dramat, Dramat allowed him to allow 
them in.   
 
Now when I interviewed him when I was obtaining this, his 
statement, I had a file that I requested from General Dramat, the file 
was for internal investigation because when this issue of irregulation 
relation came out it seems as if he appointed someone to conduct 
investigation, so in that file there was a statement of Colonel 
Madilonga, Colonel Madilonga in his statement never made mention of 
10 
Dramat, never made mention of the call that he made and never made 
mention that he assisted Captain Maluleke to let the Zimbabwean 
Police pass together with the people who were arrested, who were 
deported illegally. 
 
Now I questioned him, but unfortunately that statement was 
signed by him but was not commissioned.  He agreed that it is his own 
statement, but he said that statement was not commissioned so I 
cannot really charge him for perjury and I asked him why did you put 
this information, he said he was forced to put information. 
 
Now what made me not to believe what he was saying was that 
20 
if then I force somebody to make a statement and he makes a 
statement the first thing that I do is to run to the police station and get 
the statement commissioned.   If then in any how they really wanted 
him to lie why did they not commission the statement, because they 
have bound him forever.   
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 174 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   So which statement was commissioned? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   The statement which was 
commissioned was the one that I took with him.  Then there were a lot 
of things that really happened, like the leakage of information and I 
started to worry, I started to have a problem with the credibility of 
Madilonga as a witness.  I then took his statement for analysis, that 
was I think it was on the 4 t h of October if I am not mistaken, 2013, and 
I requested, there was another person who spoke to me and said I know  
how to analyse statement, I studied in the USA or overseas, then I 
indicated to this person I said can you do it for me for free, you know I 
10 
think you are just really a hand from God, I want to get this information 
right. 
 
Then she took that statement, she analysed it and gave me the 
report, sorry she gave me outcome, the report was not there, I saw she 
indicated how she analysed the statement and she says here and there 
and there and there Colonel Madilonga was lying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at that stage what was your understanding of what 
it was that General Sibiya and General Dramat were suspected of 
having done that was illegal? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   They – I heard so many a times 
20 
even with my consultation with Advocate Mosing, that they gave that 
operation a blessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your understanding that the thing General 
Dramat and General Sibiya were alleged to have done that was illegal, 
was to give the operation a blessing?  Because I am trying to 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 175 of 182 
 
understand exactly what it is, what unlawful conduct or criminal conduct 
was alleged against them, in this so-called rendition, because 
everybody was saying rendition, rendition, rendition, what exactly was 
it that they were said to have done which was said to have been 
unlawful or illegal or criminal. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   I think that has a little bit of a 
very short explanation.   First on the basis that the person who 
assisted the Zimbabwean Police, Captain Maluleke, was residing within 
the DPCI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Hawks? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   The Hawks.  General Dramat 
was the Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the Head, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   And the operation took place in 
Gauteng where Sibiya was responsible as the Provincial Head of the 
Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was the illegal act as you understood it, you 
were the person who was asked to investigate I take it something 
illegal that they had allegedly done. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   There was nothing we could 
20 
really say this is illegal and we had discussions, a lot of discussions 
with Colonel Makangwe and Advocate Mosing and what I was told quite 
often is that Mr Khuba you do not expect a person of Dramat’s rank of 
Sibiya’s rank to be involved in that level that you expect.  They could 
only tie them because they said how could this happen while they were 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 176 of 182 
 
there.   That is why when I got the statement of Madilonga which 
indicated that he made a call to General Dramat to request the 
permission whether he could allow the Zimbabwean Police to enter.  
When I sent that statement to Advocate Mosing and to Colonel 
Makangwe it was like a Christmas, they were very happy, because now 
you have the name that it is linked, but it is not linked to the rendition, 
it is linked to the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that is what I am trying to understand, was it 
alleged that they were complicit in the murder of some of those 
Zimbabweans, was it alleged that they were complicit in getting the 
10 
Zimbabweans handed over to the Zimbabwean Police and that handing 
over was illegal, was it alleged that they were complicit in permission 
being granted to the Zimbabwean Police to enter the South African 
borders, and that entry by the South African – Zimbabwean Police was 
illegal.  What exactly was said to be illegal that they had done, or was 
said to be a crime? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   They said they were complicit in 
allowing or in allowing or assisting Zimbabwean National to get the 
people they wanted and leave the country without following the 
extradition process.   Then there is an issue of – and this arises from a 
20 
number of issues; number one, there were success reports, these 
success reports were written by Maluleke and they were supposed to be 
signed by a person who was Maluleke’s superior, Verster, I think she 
was a full colonel because Maluleke was a Lt Colonel or a Captain, 
because after that I think he became a Lt Colonel and he left as a Lt 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 177 of 182 
 
Colonel.   
 
Now those success reports which I got from the Hawks offices 
indicated that we managed to arrest the Zimbabwean Nationals who 
were wanted in connection with something that took place in Zimbabwe, 
arising from the meeting that they had with General Dramat on this 
particular day.  I think that is where they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you understood, as you understood it the 
conduct on the part of General Dramat and General Sibiya that was 
alleged to have been unlawful or illegal or criminal was that they had 
been party to arrangements for these Zimbabweans to be handed over, 
10 
to leave the country without following extradition procedures. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and as you understood it if that – if there was 
evidence for that, that would be a crime? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is not what I understood 
from the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is what I was made to 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   On the basis that there were 
times when I would raise these issues, when we were discussing this 
case, but for me as an investigator when there is a prosecutor guiding 
the case you kind of really, I looked at a case from the investigation 
point of view and the prosecutor looked at the case from the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 178 of 182 
 
prosecution point of view, so I thought that it was probably because he 
was the one, I thought he was the one who was going to prosecute the 
case, he said it means that he is going to put it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are you referring to now when you say 
...[intervenes] 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Advocate Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but of course when you were asked to 
investigate a crime whether somebody has been involved in a crime, 
surely you have to understand what crime is being alleged isn’t it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That’s correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because otherwise you could be expected to 
investigate the crime of murder and yet you are investigating the crime 
of theft. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so it is important that the investigator 
understands what the crime is that he is investigating. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say at the beginning your understanding 
wasn’t that what the two were alleged to have done that was alleged to 
be illegal or criminal, it was not your understanding that it was that 
20 
they had assisted in handing over the Zimbabweans and to assist the 
Zimbabwean police to get them and go away with them, that wasn’t your 
understanding initially, is that right or am I confusing you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Let me clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 179 of 182 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   I think we need to differentiate 
different stages of acquiring evidence.  Now from the beginning there 
was not even a mention of General Dramat, it came up from 
Madilonga’s statements, then you came to the issue, then you come to 
the issue of the success reports, then you come to the statement of CI 
members. 
 
Now at a time when I acquired this evidence number one the 
statement of Madilonga I felt that it was not sufficient to put his name 
there, and to say that he is – he really participated, but we had a 
discussion to say that if then we are charging Manuleka for kidnapping 
10 
and there is this other evidence that shows that when these people 
were arrested and then he went there from house number three to 
house number one, congratulated the people and says you did a good 
job. 
 
My main concern is that if he was running that operation he 
was the one overseeing that operation, he would have checked the 
process that they are able to follow from that onwards, and there is an 
issue of when we talk about the rule that General Sibiya played, with 
General Sibiya there were witnesses who were saying that they saw 
him at the scene and he also kicked one of the victims, so on that when 
20 
we had a discussion I knew what is needed in order to prove the case, 
in terms of saying that Dramat probably can be prosecuted for this but 
is there any discretion that we had.  When I was told that these people 
are General Dramat, General Sibiya they have been an accomplish to 
this thing, because you see the meeting which was held, you see the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 180 of 182 
 
call which was made and also the statements of CI members saying 
that he came from number one and congratulated them for well done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But going back to my earlier question was your 
understanding at the beginning when you were asked to investigate this 
matter, was your understanding that you were investigating the possible 
commission of the crime of kidnapping or what time did you understand 
that you were being asked to investigate, from the beginning? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   From the beginning I was told 
that we – I was supposed to investigate kidnapping, I was told to 
investigate there was theft, I was told to investigate assault and 
10 
possible defeating the ends of justice, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so it was a number of crimes? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   It was a number of crimes yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, okay, but based on that it seems that 
there was nothing – there was no crime that you were supposed to 
investigate which would – which was said to arise from a breach of any 
extradition procedures, it was assaulting, it was kidnapping, it was 
whatever else but from what you said it looks like there was nothing 
about so and so did this in breach of the law relating to extradition 
procedures. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then, but did you say later on you were 
either told or you formed the view that part of what you were supposed 
to be investigating or part of what you should investigate is whether 
General Dramat and General Sibiya were complicit in assisting the 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 181 of 182 
 
departure from South Africa of the Zimbabweans in breach of 
extradition procedures? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and about how long after you had started was 
that when you got to understand that that is part of what you are 
supposed to look at? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   It was when I started to – after I 
got the statement of Madilonga and acquiring of success reports from 
DPCI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and that are you able to locate that in terms of 
10 
timelines, timeframes? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   I can say 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, 2013? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Oh I did not realise we have gone 
past five o’clock, we will have to stop now for today.  We are going to 
continue tomorrow, but we will not start at ten o’clock, we will not start 
at half past nine, what will happen is that at eleven o’clock I will start 
with an application that was adjourned which should not take long at 
all, maybe it might take 30 minutes and as soon as we are done with 
20 
that we will then continue with you.  So you must please come back 
tomorrow. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Ms Wentzel you heard what I said about the 
application? 
25 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 170 
 
Page 182 of 182 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I earlier on asked that Mr Petersen be asked to 
inform all concerned about the change in terms of time, and I 
understand he got that message.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will adjourn for the day and then tomorrow we 
will start at eleven o’clock.   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
