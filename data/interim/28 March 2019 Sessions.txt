PROCEEDINGS ON 28 MARCH 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.  Good 
morning Mr Agrizzi. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Morning Chair nice to see honourable Chair again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much and thank you for coming back to assist the 
commission. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is my pleasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I know that certain things have happened which are in the 
public domain and I just want to assure you that I was very concerned about certain 
10 
things that happened and I asked enquiries to be made and I was assured that it was 
not connected with evidence that you giving here and I was assured that the processes 
of the commission would be respected until it has finished its work.  I was informed that 
the new Director of Public Prosecutions knew nothing about those things.  I was very 
concerned and I continue to be concerned that nobody should do anything that would 
discourage witnesses from assisting the commission.  I hope that going forward no-one 
who is supposed to be really supporting the commission will do anything to discourage 
witnesses from coming forward.  But I am very grateful that despite everything you are 
here and you still want to assist the commission. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair thank you very much it has been a long road and we 
20 
anticipated it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   But we are here to help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much.  Thank you very much I hope that 
more people who have information, crucial information will be encouraged to do the 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 3 of 191 
 
right thing to come and assist this commission because what it is looking into is such an 
important project and issue for the whole nation.  And I think I will be stating the 
obvious if I say that there can be no doubt that there are many people throughout the 
country who would not like this commission to succeed.  But there are many people in 
the country who support this commission and I believe that those who support the 
commission will actually prevail and that all of us must remain undeterred in doing the 
right thing.  And I really thank you for coming forward again. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is my pleasure Chair and you are hundred percent right we 
got to do this for the next generation.  For our grandchildren and for their children’s 
children. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We have to look after this beautiful country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you very much.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  May Mr Agrizzi be sworn? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My name is Angelo Agrizzi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  None whatsoever. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be truth; the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God.

Page 4 of 191 
 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi before you you have a 
supplementary statement which has been attested to by you.  At page 60 is that your 
signature? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Mr – Advocate Pretorius just let me get there.  Yes that 
is. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just for the record Chair this is Exhibit S9.  
And from pages 1 to 60… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sorry.  So let us properly put on record because it is not a 
10 
previous one that we used is it not, the exhibit?  It is a new statement? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words are we continuing with an exhibit number that we 
used before or should we… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well this is the same exhibit number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That we used before? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Series that we used … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In respect of his earlier evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine then. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Mr Agrizzi your supplementary affidavit 
together with annexures will be Exhibit S9.  The supplementary affidavit from pages 1 
to 60 is that true and correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is true and correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then may I ask you made certain statements 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 5 of 191 
 
at the time you gave evidence originally Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the circumstances in which you 
came to give evidence.  Is it correct that you have been made no promises of reward? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No incentives have been offered to you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the giving of your evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Pretorius I am sorry.  No there was some 
noise coming from the SABC journalist here.  I do not know if it was a cell phone or 
10 
anything. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will everybody please just switch off their cell phones.  Okay let us 
proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  You have been offered no 
reward or incentive for testifying here today Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely I have not been offered any reward and 
incentive. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you not giving evidence under any form of 
compulsion? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the evidence you are giving is being given 
freely and voluntary? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Freely and voluntary Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  I would just like to highlight before you 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 6 of 191 
 
deal with the text of your affidavit Mr Agrizzi two circumstances that are relevant to your 
giving evidence today.  You should have before you Exhibit LL1.  It has not been filed in 
the papers, do you have that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Just let me have a look sorry.  Where would I find that sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair may I give you LL1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think somebody will bring you some document ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I thought I had lost it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay it is actually an annexure LL1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which will be put in the bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  At the end of the annexures in Exhibit S9? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  LL1 is a document for want of a better word 
that appears to be written in a form of Zulu and LL2 is an attempt by the investigators at 
least to translate that document.  Would you tell the Chair please about the 
circumstances in which the origin of this document came into your possession? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will.  Chair I do not always raise these issues and I actually 
did not – it was by chance.  I have been very flippant about any threats and that type of 
20 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I have kind of taken in my stride now and I try not to make a 
big thing out of it because otherwise… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 7 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My family get to hear about it and unfortunately I have not 
briefed them on this yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So they are going to hear it for the first time now.  The 
problem is that if I stop making… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe are you comfortable to talk about it before you talk to 
them? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your family or are you… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I am in trouble already with wife.  She is now watching 
10 
this probably and saying ‘now come on tell us’. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And if I do not say something now my phone is going to start 
ringing and I – you know what I am – Advocate Pretorius with all due respects has put 
me in a lot of trouble right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But it is fine.  It was in a meeting where I got – where I 
actually was in trouble last week for not picking her up at the airport on time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Chair.  So I get a lot of these things.  I get missed calls.  I 
20 
get funny numbers.  I get put onto these Facebook groups and a lot of that.  So I came 
out of breakfast one morning at Nickle Way and I found this on my windscreen.  I 
actually – what I have learnt to do is to throw them away but this specific one I 
crumpled up and I thought no let me just keep this.  And I called the guys who wash the 
cars there and I asked them if they saw and they said no, no, they did not see anything.  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 8 of 191 
 
And it so happened that Mr Dutton was meeting me with Patrick at the Advocate’s 
offices and I said to them by the way can you interpret this for me?  And I gave it to 
them and this is probably why it is there but you know I have learnt I take it in my stride 
now.  I accept it and yes it is going to happen.  And I have been cautioned.  I have been 
told that perhaps maybe I should take these things more seriously which I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So thank you Advocate Pretorius for creating problems. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we did however discuss this in preparation 
for your evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I do not want to … 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Go there for the moment.  The second incident 
was discussed with you that I would like to place on record. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is in the public interest and the legal team 
believes in your interest as well. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I have discussed that with my family. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Last night members of the investigation team… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Pretorius I am still trying to understand 
20 
this LL1 and LL2.  Okay no that is fine.  There might be a need for a relook at the 
translation. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is an attempt. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 9 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To translate and in very general terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It does appear to be a threat that was placed 
on Mr Agrizzi’s windscreen in a parking lot with reference to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it certainly is a threat. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  His mother and a statement to the effect that 
we know what car you drive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But perhaps a more accurate translation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And commentary on the type of language used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It does not seem to be used I am told by a pure 
Zulu speaker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  One translation might be the one that is given in LL2.  
Another translation might be that they were saying he must stop talk – stop talking 
about state capture and talk about Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only.  So that… 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That appears clear from the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At least the attempted translation but a better 
translation may be provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja okay no that is fine. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 10 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second incident which the legal team 
believes should be placed on record and made public is last night the investigators 
received a message from a very senior police officer saying that your life was under 
threat and this was on reliable information.  You aware of that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was told last night yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And as a result of that further security was 
provided 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Notwithstanding those threats you still 
willing to give evidence today? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In your evidence during January this year Mr 
Agrizzi certain questions were raised by the Chair and other questions arose during the 
course of evidence which you have asked leave to deal with in your evidence.  Your 
evidence therefore will cover two aspects.  Firstly a response to questions raised by the 
Chair and other questions which arose during the course of your original testimony.  
The second part of your evidence will deal with new matters that you wish to place 
before the Chair.   
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we may go then to page 2 of the statement, 
paragraph 2.  During the course of your evidence you referred to amongst other people 
a Mr Sesinyi Seopela and Fana Hlongwane, do you recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 11 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the question was raised whether at the 
time the contract between the Post Office and Bosasa was entered into whether either 
Mr Seopela or Mr Hlongwane had any direct links or influence with the Post Office, do 
you recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the position?  What was the position? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair.  Chair the position is very simple is that Sesinyi 
Seopela did not have any links with the Post Office at that stage.  The only reason I 
mentioned Fana Hlongwane was because Sesinyi worked for Fana Hlongwane on the 
arms deal.  In terms of Seopela he was – he was employed by African Global or 
10 
Consillium one of the two companies to basically chase up ministerial leads and to 
make sure that Bosasa and the African Global Group of Companies kept their 
associations healthy in terms of political and economic wellbeing with the ANC. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You also gave evidence of a system crash or a 
server crash and you were asked whether you had a screenshot of the communication 
that was sent to Bosasa employees. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the position in that regard? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I basically have given my assistance in terms of laptops, 
my iPads everything I have given over to the commission and the investigators.  Sorry.  
20 
And I still have not got the screenshot but what I – we did manage to get was a report – 
sorry – we got a report from Johnny Wilkinson from a forensics lab that is accredited 
that I had done years ago to provide to the commission to show that there was indeed a 
crash and there was indeed information lost on the server itself.  Now originally we 
prepared that report as a defence as it is reflected in annexure EE. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 12 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us go to annexure EE because there 
has been evidence not about this crash but other crashes.  The document that you refer 
to prepared by Johnny Wilkinson appears at page 63.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the document you referred to? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is the document yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  It appears on the face of it to have 
been prepared by Johnny Wilkinson imperative technology. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on the 18 February 2011? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is under the head: Document Distribution 
Chair on page 63.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please tell the Chair the circumstances of the 
circumstances which gave rise to the production of this report? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair basically what happened was we had a meeting – I do 
not know if you recall in my very first affidavit where I said we had the meeting with 
Advocate Lawrence Hodes and then we had to go downstairs with Gavin Watson and 
he said you must destroy the evidence and all that type of thing.  Well coming 
20 
emanating from that meeting we basically needed to do a report on amongst other 
things the server crash.  So if you go to page – I will tell you now. Sorry.  If you go to 
page 75. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  That basically gives you the scope of the server crash. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 13 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we could go to page 76 it is described in 
detail there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is if our pagination matches.  Under the 
heading Background.  Do you see that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the report reads: 
“The My Documents user files volume of the file server failed on 
Thursday 8 November 2007 around 20:00.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that in fact a reference to the crash? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in the second paragraph it reads: 
“An attempt was made to recover data from backup tapes.  This 
operation proved to be unsuccessful due to backup procedures 
having failed for a period of time as a result of the volume being 
too full to run successful backups.  The success rate of the 
recovery was estimated at around 30%.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can you confirm from your own knowledge 
20 
firstly that there was a file server failure or crash and secondly that that resulted in 
approximately 70% of the data on the servers being lost? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I can attest to the fact that the crash was in other words 
manipulated.  Did happen.  But I can also attest to the fact that the data that was lost 
we have actually provided the commission with the hard drives of that data before it 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 14 of 191 
 
was lost.  And obviously you know you can go into it and have a look at it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Would you just remind the Chair please 
of the – of those events?  There was an instruction that a crash should occur as I recall 
your evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Notwithstanding that steps were taken by 
yourself and perhaps others to preserve data? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What were those steps? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The steps was my instructions to Leon Van Tonder was to 
10 
make a backup and double up on the server and keep that safe so that if we needed 
the information going forward we had the information. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then the final paragraph under the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry this was now way back in 2007? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And your thought that you might need the information was 
connected – was it connected with what subsequently happened in 2017/2018 and so 
on?  In other words… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair sometimes… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait – did you envisage then that there could come a time in the 
20 
future when you might need that information for the present purposes or purposes 
connected with whatever gave rise to the parting of the ways between you and Mr 
Gavin Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair sometimes – sorry I interrupted you but 
sometimes you do things.  You know you are not supposed to be deleting this but 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 15 of 191 
 
sometimes like you get this little voice that tells you, listen here just step back a bit and 
the funny thing was Leon confirmed it to me as well.  He said, Angelo let us rather 
make a copy here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And you know it just shows you sometimes you just got to 
listen.  And that little voice tells you, that is – to do it.  It is the same with the video 
recording of the cash in the vault.  The little voice tells you, just make a recording. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot explain it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know there was no – at that stage there was just “do it” 
and we – and I instructed Leon to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage the relationship was good – it was fine? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no problem? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No problem.  As a matter of fact there was just a couple of 
news reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nothing we did not even know that the problems would 
escalate and that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just had an inclination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But interestingly enough you know the 70% of the data was 
the data regarding the tenders of DCS. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 16 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The final paragraph under the head 
“Background” reads: 
“The disaster was declared and all heads of department were 
informed during a meeting held in the data centre at 09:00 on the 
9 November 2007.  Concerns were raised and possible recovery 
mechanisms were discussed.” 
Is it correct then that whether by way of a circular or a screenshot or a data message 
the employees or the senior employees at least of Bosasa were informed of the crash? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair that is correct.  In actually fact there is a document that I 
10 
personally authored and put out with the IT Department to notify everybody and to put a 
contingency plan and a risk aversion plan in place.  I cannot get hold of that document 
unfortunately as you know some of our witnesses have been assaulted and frog 
marched and that so it is very difficult to get it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 77 is another document that 
appears to be an email to Bosasa from Kobus Smith and it states:  “Dear Johan”, who 
is the Johan? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Johan Fourie is one of the IT coordinators in a senior position. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who as Kobus Smith? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Kobus Smith was the supplier at that stage the company was 
20 
using Datacentrix and he was the liaison for the company from Datacentrix. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event he says:  
“It is with regret that I have to inform you that we cannot perform 
a data recovery on your raid, r-a-i-d 5 set due to two hard drives 
having failed simultaneously.  According to our data recovery 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 17 of 191 
 
specialists it is impossible to rebuild the raid set if two drives 
fail.” 
Was that the position to the knowledge of Bosasa and its employees at that time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That document is dated the 9 November 2007.  
Is there anything else in regard to the server crash or the servers’ crash that you want 
to tell the Chair about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not at this stage no.  I know that there was one plan but I 
think we covered that in the affidavit itself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go back then to your statement at 
10 
paragraph 4.  Questions were raised by the Chair and questions arose in any event 
about the volume of cash that was being dealt with in the vault of Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For distribution.  Would you tell the Chair 
please what the minimum amount was at any one time in the safe or safes or in the 
vault and what the maximum amount were at any one time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Chair the – to answer the question simply it was R2 million 
was the minimum amount that we would have to have in the vault.  And the maximum 
was about R6.5 million but it went over that.  How I knew it was R6.5 million was 
because there were three safes.  When you packed the two safes full that was R6.5 
20 
million and normally that is the capacity it would take.  Depending it was R100’s or 
R200’s notes but mostly it was R100 and R200 notes.  And it would go over that – over 
certain periods of time in the year.  I think it was 2014 I think it went over that over the 
Christmas period because bonuses get paid out to directors and that type of thing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right so – so I understand your evidence at 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 18 of 191 
 
any one time there would be a minimum amount of R2 million in cash available for 
distribution? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But at certain times that amount would 
increase to R6.5 million or more? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sometimes much more ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Depending on the time of the year and the 
requirements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair.  So especially over the December period 
it would happen in November because you would  - you would try and get the cash in in 
10 
November because in December everybody went away.  So you would – it would 
normally pump up in I would say November rather and then towards the beginning of 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said a few minutes ago that during the December period you 
know the amounts could be higher because of bonuses that needed to be paid and you 
mentioned directors of the company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were the bonuses of directors of Bosasa companies also paid out of 
the cash that was there?  Were they paid in cash not in normal way that one would 
expect? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No they were paid in cash over December especially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were sometimes that they put through a bonus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  On the payroll but normally it was like R2 / R300 000,00 in 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 19 of 191 
 
cash over December per person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you – you probably know why? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You probably know why it was thought they should be paid in cash in 
terms of their bonuses the directors? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes because it was a tax duck. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 5 Mr Agrizzi you deal with 
the frequency how often the safes would be refilled and how the logistics worked in 
relation to monies coming in and monies going out.  Would you tell the Chair about that 
10 
please as you deal with it in paragraph 5 of your statement? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I do not want to actually – last time I read from my 
statement.  I actually do not want to.  I want to tell you as it is okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I might, sorry Advocate Pretorius.  I might get the order not 
exactly the same as. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We did in the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But to cut it really frankly what was happening was there was 
20 
bog deliveries happening at one stage.  So there was every week there would be a 
delivery of 2.6 to R3 million around there, but then I started getting concerned and what 
happened then was it was changed to a weekly delivery which was about between 
900 000, 1.2 million sometimes it was more.  It all depended, because what would 
happen is Andries van Tonder would go to Gavin on a Monday morning and then say to 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 20 of 191 
 
Gavin listen how much do you need and Gavin would say well X amount and then 
Andries would phone up Gregg Lacon-Allan and say order me 1.5 tons of chicken and 
that is how it would happen.  So that was normally the amounts ordered at a time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then once the money or the cash had been 
received what would then happen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well when the cash was received there was a reconciliation 
process.  The cash would then be taken into the company secretary vault where there 
was a safe.  I would have to double check it and Andries van Tonder would have to 
double check it and would reconcile it.  There would be normally a piece of paper.  I 
mean I did not keep them all, but I did keep one or two and then we would hear when 
10 
Gavin is available and then the cash would be transported to the main vault, to 
Mr Watson’s vault and from there it would packed and he would count it sometimes.  
Sometimes they would not count it, but you saw in the video. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was a matter raised very briefly in 
preparation for your evidence Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But do you recall and if I take you by surprise 
my apologies and we consider whether you deal with it later, but you recall the 
evidence of Mr Greg Lawrence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I saw it briefly and ja I do recall it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well just one point in regard to that evidence.  
If you need time to think about it that is in order.  He appeared to have a lack of 
memory, to put it mildly, in regard to the amounts of cash delivered to Bosasa.  Do you 
have any comment on that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do.  Chair I know Greg Lawrence for many, many years.  As 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 21 of 191 
 
a matter of fact Greg Lawrence I got to come to the Commission through another friend, 
because I wanted him to come clean but, you know, the funny thing is that what 
happened was a day before the testimony Greg Lawrence and another acquaintance 
flew down and you can check SAA records and Airlink records, they flew down to 
Durban to see Mr Gregg Lacon-Allan from Equal Trade and when he came back here 
he had sudden lapse of memory and he only showed you certain videos or maybe he 
showed you more I do not know, but I cannot understand; well I can understand the 
lapse of memory Chair but I think if you check the, I will give the investigators the name 
of the other person, if you check the flight plans and SAA tickets and Comair tickets I 
am sure you will pick them up and then ask the relevant questions on why did you 
10 
travel down there and why did you come back.  Unfortunately because this is so big 
witnesses do get interfered with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the amounts that he would have 
delivered to your knowledge can you help the Commission? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What amounts would he have delivered to your 
knowledge to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there would be that specific one delivery that I did see 
was R900 000 he said and the following week he was bringing another R1 million or the 
20 
following Monday if I recall correctly, but no the amounts were sometimes R2.8 million, 
R3 million but I must just add there Andries van Tonder would collect those.  They were 
never delivered to Bosasa.  Andries van Tondre would collect them at Lanseria.  There 
is a petrol station, because I attended once with him just to assess the risk and we can 
take you there and show you but we can show you in the payments to Equal Trade 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 22 of 191 
 
exactly how much was delivered.  We can; that information is available. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So as I understand your evidence without 
going into too much detail the amounts would have run into several millions? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, most definitely Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And sometimes several million at a time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair.  If I can add? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair if we want to clean up we have to be honest.  We do not 
need to protect each other.  We do not need to protect, we have to be honest otherwise 
where are we going and I must tell you I do not think he was being completely honest. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you were asked Mr Agrizzi about the 
Directors and shareholders of Dyambu and Bosasa at the time you were first employed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Obviously it would be too difficult for you 
personally to trace the directorships over the whole period of your employment, but to 
the best of your recollection would you tell the Chair who were the Directors of Dyambu 
which later became Bosasa and who were the shareholders at the time you were 
employed and remind us please when were you first employed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  8 May 1998 or nine, I cannot remember. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Tell the Chair please who those persons 
20 
were? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair when I was first employed the original interview 
happened with Danny Mansell and I was then told he is a 50 percent shareholder and I 
was then introduced to Gavin Watson who was a 50 percent shareholder and then I met 
with, I think it was, Vivi Masino who was apparently a Director.  A guy by the name of 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 23 of 191 
 
Thabani Mngomezulu who came from the mines.  He was a union shop steward and he 
had joined, a nice fellow, he had joined from NUM into Bosasa and he was instrumental 
in doing the marketing on the mines and there was a gentleman, a thin gentleman, by 
the name of Wellington Ntshanka who passed away.  There was a gentleman by the 
name of Temba Snyman.  There was a lady by the name of Lindie Gouws.  There was, 
gee I cannot remember.  I will have to look at my notes, because [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No that was it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Temba Snyman unfortunately has passed away. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the shareholders were? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gavin Watson, Danny Mansell. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  50 percent each? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In any event you can confirm that to 
the best of your recollection the persons solicited in 6.1 of your supplementary affidavit 
were indeed those Directors? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And shareholders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you were also Mr Agrizzi approximately 
how many employees and officials and that is Government employees and officials 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 24 of 191 
 
would have received regular bribes and this would be an average over a period of time. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, and Chair unfortunately you know memory is what it is 
when you get to my age.  I remember 38.  I remember counting on a list 38 and how I 
remember it is because one of the pages that I used in one of my writing pads has got 
38 lines and it was a full page and that is how I remember 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who decided who would receive cash? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it is very simple.  Gavin Watson was the ultimate 
decision maker.  He would decide, so what would happen is a Director like let us say 
Syvion Dlamini would come to me and say you know Angelo we have got to work with 
10 
Mama X because Mama X can influence Mr D who can sign off on Mr C.  So what do 
you think and I would say to the person well what are you talking, how much money are 
you talking here.  They would start off normally with R200 000 was a favourite number 
and then I would say no, but let us look at this realistically.  Even if we have the 
contract, so the reason why they would come to me is I would know more or less how 
much profits each contract would make.  So I would be able to say listen this is totally 
ridiculous.  You cannot have an installation like the Commission for R10 million, but you 
want to pay out R9 million in bribes.  So I would have to do that analysis for Gavin, but 
ultimately I would have to then go with that information to Gavin Watson, he would 
decide.  I had no jurisdiction on deciding you may pay somebody X or Y.  I was not 
20 
liked, because I would always cut them down, cut them down, cut them down.  So I 
would be able to give advice, but ultimately your decision maker would be the Director, 
Gavin Watson, on who gets paid the bribes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say whether most of the time your recommendations 
in terms of amounts were accepted by Mr Gavin Watson? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 25 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he would not, on certain of them he would not give me 
feedback on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I would say a recommendation.  Like I remember for 
instance asking a question why are we paying a certain person a million Rand a 
month?  How on earth do we do it and I was told no, no but he is looking after other 
people.  Now that decision I never made.  I was never party to that, but I was asked my 
advice you known.  When I heard the amount I thought it was ludicrous and with my 
decision, I would not say that my recommendations would be accepted.  I think the 
reason why I was always used first was to negotiate them down and then to, you know, 
10 
go.  So kind of if I can explain it in layman’s terms.  It is like going to shop in the plaza, 
you know.  The first salesman comes and then they bring another salesman.  So one 
salesman will say no, no you are going to pay for that R200.  Then the other guy comes 
and he says no, no R150.  Do not worry about him.  So you feel very happy and I think 
that was the same type of tactic that was being used by Gavin.  He used to get me to 
cut them down to the bone, but ultimately he would make the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You kept records in your system about what 
you have testified.  That system reflected in amongst other documents the black 
books? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was that a complete record of monies going 
out or did you conclude that there must have been other monies to which you did not 
account for? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair, curiosity always gets the better of you and I 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 26 of 191 
 
knew exactly how much I had signed off on and how much I packed for the Directors in 
their bags and, but there was always like R2 million, R1.8 million, R2 million over and 
that would be left in the vault, but interesting I did not know who the other people were 
who were getting, you know.  I do not know.  So there was always this R2 million 
discrepancy, but next week you come to, you have to fill up the vault again and there is 
nothing and you have got to get it back to its order there.  So that amount of money I 
cannot attest to.  I do not know you know where it was used by Mr Watson, but he was 
the only one who had keys for his vault, not for his vault for the actual safes 
themselves. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I take it nor could you say that that amount was 
10 
used for bribes if you did not know what it was used for? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, I do not know what it was used for.  I find it hard to believe 
Chair that it would not be anything but bribes, because you cannot, I do not think 
Mr Watson would have banked that money or used that money.  I mean I do not think 
anybody can use R2 million a month. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is a general observation you make on 
the basis of probabilities of which you were aware? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not want to make assumptions.  Let me rather stick to I do 
not know what happened to it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Then the question arose in relation to 
20 
the evidence that you gave as to which companies were used to provide Bosasa with 
cash. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you were asked to list those companies. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 27 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have done so in paragraph 8 of your 
statement. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which page, sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you tell the Chair please about those 
companies or just name those companies? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So one of the companies was Lamazest.  That was not for 
cash predominantly but for filtering let us call it racketeering.  One of the companies 
was Equal Foods.  There are different derivatives of Equal Foods.  There is Equal Food 
4.  There is Equal Food Trading.  Equal Trade all those type of derivatives.  I cannot, 
Chair I literally walked out like as if I had nothing.  I basically went home with my one 
10 
book.  So I did not take copies of records or anything with me.  I did not have that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you mention Equal Trade 4 (Pty) Ltd. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Equal Food Traders (Pty) Ltd. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall those companies? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I recall those. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, [intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I am saying there might be different derivatives that I 
20 
cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, they appear, the list appears at page 6 of your statement. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the top. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 28 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The other one were the liquor outlets which was liquor outlets 
and sales within Bosasa because we had bars and canteens.  The Lindela Repatriation 
Camp was another one I mentioned in my first affidavit and then there was Riekele 
Construction that worked with the liquor store, in tandem with the liquor store.  A 
gentleman by the name of Riaan Hoeksma and Riekele would fetch the money for us.  
We would pay them and they would then take a percentage of that and then there was 
AA Wholesalers in Lenasia that was used quite frequently for cash and also for 
racketeering, tax fraud that type of thing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You then referred in your evidence previously 
10 
to another method of generating cash which did not necessarily involve the cooperation 
of an outside company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should just remind us very briefly 
of that method of generating of cash. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In terms of the fraudulent invoices? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was where BEE and SNME company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Payments were used, but without actually 
involving those companies. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where Bosasa would generate invoices 
presumably for the payment of casual labour.  Those would be paid in cash, but that 
cash would be used by Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Carlos, he is a very astute accountant and basically between 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 29 of 191 
 
him and Jacques van Zyl they picked up on a liquidations list or they looked for the 
liquidations of companies in the newspapers and things like that and then they would 
use those companies names or companies that were supplying us at one stage.  One of 
them was Kgwetlo Events where they were supplying us and their stuff was going 
through the books so it would not raise flags for the auditors and basically false 
invoices were drawn up, cash cheques produced and if the auditors asked why they are 
cash cheques then what would happen is you would say no, no but they are BEE and 
they need cash cheques.  As a matter of fact that actually, I do not allude to it in the 
statement, but it reminded me when somebody sent me an email there were three 
occasions where the auditors said listen you guys have not got a clean audit.  These 
10 
are discrepancies in your audit.  I think I provided the Commission with three letters 
from [indistinct] Viljoen at that stage.  So that is the system that was used, is running up 
fraudulent invoices and then drawing cash cheques and this started to become a 
problem because the banks everybody looks at and says but in your account you have 
got over R4 million going in cash cheques.  So it was reported by [indistinct] Viljoen.  
We also had to deal with, if I recall correctly, at [indistinct] as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that practice did not continue for very long 
did it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When I found out about how it was happening I actually went 
one day with them and I stopped it because it was too risky.  I mean they were sending 
20 
accounts ladies to go and fetch R700 000, 400 000, R500 000 cash. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was a physical protection issue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, as well and it was sticking out like a sore thumb. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  That then relates to the question at 
paragraph 9.  You have already dealt with that unless you have anything to add.  That 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 30 of 191 
 
is the issue relating to casual workers and the use of the fictitious casual worker system 
to generate cash. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  I give that in a nutshell Chair.  Basically what happened 
was there was a lot of construction happening at the time.  Riekele Construction was 
doing the construction and at that stage they felt that the best way to get cash out was 
to use casual wages and that was a time before the UIF changed the Act and you had 
register even casual workers with UIF.  So they would draw up a spreadsheet on Excel 
and just add casual wages, R220 per person per day and you would work them for a 
month and say you had 500 people on that payroll.  It was an Excel spreadsheet.  
There were no deductions nothing.  It gets printed out, go the bank, draw cheques for 
10 
that value and so oh no this was casual wages.  Chair nobody, we had a rule in the 
company that everybody had to have a bank account, because we only gave people 
wages on EFT and that was a policy that I brought in, in 2002 already.  So all these 
casual wages are easy to identify in the HR Department, because number one they will 
not reflect there and number two all you need to do is ask for the employment contracts 
for those people. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the system he used. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in essence cash would be paid to non-
existent casual labourers.  That cash would then come back to Bosasa for its own 
20 
uses? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of time frames what period are we talking about when 
we talk about the payment of? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Casual labourers. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 31 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supposed payment of ghost employees, casual employees? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think about a year Chair.  I think it was between. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between what period and what period, what year and what year if 
you are able to say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would have to look. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In my notes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot actually remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember and for how long do you think it? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was about eight months a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Over a number of years or in a particular year? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it happened for one year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, in one year. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Between eight months and a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then I got concerned about the safety. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know we were having ladies collecting seven, R800 000 
at the normal bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And coming back to the office.  Something was bound to go 
wrong. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 32 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So we immediately stopped that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you cannot remember the year, but it was a certain year 
and during that year it went on for about eight months, more or less? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair I will be able to pick it up from the Missing 
Viljoen Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When we have a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will try and find the two letters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That I provided and it was highlighted there as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That the amount of cash transactions is ridiculous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 10 you answer the question 
raised by the Chair in relation to contracts that Bosasa obtained.  That were awarded to 
Bosasa during certain periods. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please place those on record if you would? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, do I have to mention every single contract, because I 
might have slipped a few, forgotten a few or do you [intervenes]? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, mention the ones in your statement. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you can read them. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 33 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In 1999 to 2002 there were the Goldmines that started off with 
Kloof, Libanon, Sasol, Randfontein Estates, Hartebeesfontein and Harmony Gold Mine 
in the Free State.  Goedehoop Colliery and Horizon Youth Centre in the Western Cape.  
Then in 2001 to 2004 we split it up because those were mostly security contracts.  So 
we had the Post Office Contract which covered guarding at the various post offices plus 
it covered the pension pay-outs and then those were mostly predominantly security 
contracts and [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you talk about the Airports Company as 
10 
well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Airports Company as well.  It started off with Olivier Tambo.  
They had a problem with their car parks and we got the contract awarded to us there.  
In 2004 to 2007 was Correctional Services.  I remember mentioning to you before there 
was a training contract which I never knew about.  I was invited to the awards evening 
by Dr Smith and by Mark Taverner who was running it.  I had the catering contract 
management at seven management areas.  Then we got the Sondolo IT Access Control 
and CCTV Contract.  The Sondolo IT Television Network System that we put into every 
single cell in every single correctional centre.  Then there was the Phezulu Contract 
which was for the fencing and these all had maintenance contracts linked to them as 
20 
well.  So there was either a variation order or an extension on those contracts because 
of that.  So the focus 2004 to 2007 was Correctional Services that gave us the growth 
and then in 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Simply looking at your statement under 2004 to 2007 and 
Correctional Services, so you, so Bosasa had something like one, two, three, four, five, 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 34 of 191 
 
six contracts with Correctional Services and you say most of the time each one of those 
had a maintenance contract in addition? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or an extension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or an extension? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The last one Chair not six, there is five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The last one was various youth centres in the North West.  I 
do not know why that is under Correctional Services heading, but [intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should not be under Correctional Services. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think the dates are, we should not look at the label. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or the heading.  We should look at only the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, but that last one various North West youth centres. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Falls outside of Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So we have grouped them in dates not in actual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Centres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 35 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair and then in 2007 we did the very first guarding contract 
for the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At that stage it was all the rural areas guarding that we did 
successfully for them and then we also did the various Limpopo Youth Centres as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that too should not be [intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  [Intervenes] that is an error on my part.  I do not think we 
should have the label. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The headings. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It should be the years. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well of course we do want to know who the contracts were 
with. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that is important. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, but under 2007 to 2010 the guarding security contract was with 
the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the contract or contracts with various Limpopo Youth Centres 
was separate? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Department of Social Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  Can I continue Chair/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please continue. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 36 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: 
 
In 
2011 
to 
2016 
there 
was 
a 
youth 
centre, 
Clanwilliam/Namaqua Youth Centre.  There was a Department of Justice and 
Constitutional Provisional Access Control CCTV and fencing which started off for 101 
courts nationally.  So what it was, was an integrated system that had to be put in.  It 
was being managed at that stage the Department of Justice appointed the IDT to 
manage it, the Independent Development Trust, to manage it and they managed it on 
behalf of the Department of Justice and there were two liaison people, three liaison 
people from Justice that would sit in on all the meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I only attended a few of the meetings. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I was not too clued up on that and then there was the 
Airports Company as well.  Contracts to all the airports in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So at that stage Bosasa basically managed every airport in 
South Africa either on the air side or the land side with the exception of the Polokwane 
Airport and Lanseria those type of airports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But all your major hubs were managed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do I understand you correctly, you say that this 
is not necessarily a complete list? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know I am working off memory. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 37 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And memory sometimes fails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which department would be involved in 
relation to the youth centres/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Department of Social Development. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the contracts involving Lindela? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The Department of Home Affairs. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that, Lindela is that on the list here?  I do 
not see it. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No Lindela has been the pre-existing contract for many, many 
years.  What happened was Lindela was, we had a renegotiation process with Lindela.  
So I did not include that here because that was renegotiation on that contract. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, but for the sake of completeness in one 
or other category we could add Lindela to this list? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well you could, but it was actually awarded.  If you look at the 
heading it says how many contracts were awarded to.  So that is why I did not put 
Lindela in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Lindela was pre-existing. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [Indistinct]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you were also asked to give the Chair an 
estimate of the value or the approximate value of the contracts. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I am going, I have worked on an estimate because and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 38 of 191 
 
when I say an estimate you probably find that it is within a million Rand or R2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the reason for that is I do not have any documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I walked out with nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the Sabania Mines if I remember correctly the annual 
contract value was about R71 million per annum.  It could have been a little bit more.  
Correctional Services I think is pretty accurate.  That was R580 million per annum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you also when you deal these contracts 
please Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just talk about the amount in the last column. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The estimated annual bribes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  Sabania Mines was about R3million, you know those 
were smaller union type things that we had to sort out, so it’s about R3million, it worked 
out to about R280 000 per month I think.  Correctional Services I can only talk about 
the volume of cash going out, I can’t talk about what the houses cost, or that type of 
20 
thing because I was never involved with that, I didn’t know what cars were bought at 
what stage until only after 2007 I think or 2008, so I can only tell you what was going on 
a normal basis, so let’s say this is pay-as-you-go kind of thing, there’s no better word to 
explain it, it was R15million a year, and it sounds ridiculous,  R15million a year sounds 
like an astronomical figure, but remember one person was taking out a R1million a 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 39 of 191 
 
month, so that gives you the impact of it. 
 
Corana was about R3.6million per annum, the value of that contract was 
about R122million per month. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will deal with that contract specifically later 
in your evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, I think we do deal with that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright if you look at the Department of Justice the total there 
was – it was a massive contract, R700million I think, it was about R16.5million that was 
paid out in cash.  Access Control and CCTV for Corrections was about R241million and 
10 
there was about R4.2million paid out in bribes, in gratuities, the TV systems was about 
R300million and if I remember correctly that was also about R5million in gratuities.  
Phezulu Fencing was about R800million and if I remember correctly it was about close 
on R10million paid out in gratuities as well.   
 
Northwest the Youth Centre there I remember vividly it was R32million and 
R4.5million was paid out there, the Youth Centre in Mogali was about R14million and 
R2.3million was paid out there.  The Airports Company was about R32million per 
annum and it was about R2.2million and then it says here continuing, but it’s because 
of the page break and I’m not very good on Microsoft so I didn’t know how to actually 
type it, so don’t – don’t worry about that it should have been on a separate page but 
20 
North West it’s pre-opening expenses on the software was about R2.2million paid out, 
of R4.5million and Chair will remember that I explained on the software from last time is 
that the easiest way to – what some of the directors would ask for is we need to sort out 
the elections or whatever and this HOD or this MEC wants R2.2million and the only way 
to do it really is by software, charging for software and the software is there anyway, so 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 40 of 191 
 
you charge for software, there’s no cost incurred, the company makes R2.3million and 
the other person gets R2.2million. 
 
Eskom I don’t know ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That one relating to Northwest Youth Centre bribes amounting to 
R2.2million a year when the contract value is about four million five hundred thousand? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  Now the contract value was for the supply of 
software so it was just dropping off software, there was another contract which was 
valued at about, it was R1.4million per month, so it would have been R17million but that 
was to run the facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This was over and above it, so what happened there 
specifically was we were approached well me by Syvion Dlamini, one of the directors, 
and said look they need money for elections, whether it’s true or not I don’t know.  What 
I do know is that he would say they’ve told me we can charge them for software 
R4.5million but they want R2.2million out of that, so the software was there and all that 
had to happen was you had to write a proposal and said we want to propose that you 
use this special Youth Centre software and it’s going to cost you R4.5million.  The 
problem comes in is that from an audit perspective you can’t prove that they didn’t 
receive the software, because the software is there, but the value of the software has 
been so inflated that to be able to allow for a gratuity of R2.2million, does that clarify 
20 
why?  So that’s not the services, that’s only software. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Eskom I don’t know but I was told reliably there was 
something there, I will try and get more information from the people and as soon as I 
have it I will provide them to come, I won’t coerce them but I will get them nudged in to 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 41 of 191 
 
come to the Commission and speak about it.  There was an access control contract, 
and then the Department of Home Affairs was R85million and there was promises and 
cash paid close to the value of about R7.2million, at PRASA as well I’ve had some of 
the whistleblowers start coming to me about PRASA there is an amount there and there 
is a bribe being paid there but if I get solid reliable tested information I will provide the 
investigators, as I have been, with all the information, I will provide it to whoever needs 
it, as it comes in, but you know I don’t want to put – and that’s why I’ve said here I 
haven’t put any figures there because I want to get tacit and real information.  Alright so 
in the total of, and the calculation is incorrect because the total, I didn’t do the total 
unfortunately but the total is not R89million, I only see that now. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It’s at least, in other words the unknown 
amounts are not included. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   Oh okay, you’ve got to add the two together because I had 
them separately, so the annual contract value is about R2.5billion, the total value of the 
contract there, of those various contracts per annum and your total gratuities is about 
R10million, does that answer Chair’s question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The historical contract is 2000 to 2016, the 
total value is over R2billion. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the continuing contract you estimate 
where you know the values to be in the region of R90million. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the bribes are totalled in the columns or 
the estimates are totalled in the columns that we see in this statement. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 42 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were then asked ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius before you go to the next one you may have 
already said this previously but I just want you to say it in case you didn’t, it seems 
logical that in quoting the contract prices if Bosasa knew that they were going to be 
paying bribes for the duration of the contracts that they would get, it seems logical that 
they would inflate their contract prices, is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the contracts were run at between a 35 and 40% GP, a 
percentage which is phenomenal in today’s times. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It’s gross profit? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gross profit percentage, before we get to net, and then these 
were, remember the bribes are always worked into the contract in terms of chicken 
consumption and things like that so it wasn’t you couldn’t notice it so it would bring the 
GP percentage down by about ag it was negligible, a couple of cents, but yes to answer 
your question yes, the bribes were always factored in.  I was told factor in 2.5% or I was 
told factor in we need to pay R2million out, I was told to factor it in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, in relation to that question and your 
answer Mr Agrizzi two issues arise, firstly how were the bribes ultimately accounted for 
in the books in relation to tax. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No they weren’t accounted for. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words they ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No let me explain to you how it would work. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It would go as an expense? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, well that’s the thing is it comes in as an expense so you 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 43 of 191 
 
benefit in terms of the tax, so your profit, because you don’t want to declare it as a 
dividend afterwards because you pay tax on it, so what was happening and we had – 
the gentleman who sat here yesterday was very clever in how he structured it for us but 
what would happen is that you take it into consumption, so it becomes a cost of sale, 
and of course you deflate your profit so it’s coming out, you’ve got this six or eight 
million Rand in cash, plus you’re paying less tax on it, it’s cheaper than paying 15% 
dividends tax or 18% dividends tax or even 28% company tax, so that’s how it was 
done. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the second question arises as a general 
comment quite apart from the bribes was the State receiving value for money from 
10 
Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Unfortunately they were receiving in certain aspects value for 
money, in certain other aspects no, so – and I think I mentioned that in my previous 
statement if I recall correctly, they paid a premium, but good quality, so they paid for a 
Rolls Royce and they got a Rolls Royce.  I don’t know if that explains your – I don’t 
want to say, each contract was totally different, in Lindela they weren’t receiving value 
for money, in the Youth Centres they  were receiving value for money so it’s not one 
answer fits all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, perhaps that’s an unfair question, sorry. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is an important question about whether the State got value for 
money because I heard evidence from Mr Dennis Bloem some time earlier who is a 
member of Parliament and who served for a certain number of years in the Correctional 
Services Portfolio Committee who testified that with regard to – I think it is, you referred 
to it as a kitchen contract. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 44 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the kitchen contract for Correctional Services, 
Correctional Facilities, actually in effect Bosasa was not doing the work, was not doing 
the work or most of the work, I don’t want to misrepresent what he said, most of the 
work insofar as the so-called kitchen contract is concerned was done by prisoners. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I certainly got the impression from what he said and I think he 
was quite emphatic about this because he even said he was not talking about 
something he heard about, he was talking about something that he knew that the work, 
the actual work in regard to this so-called kitchen contract was being done by prisoners, 
10 
or most of the work, I don’t know if he was saying all the work but most of the work he 
said was done by  the inmates and not by Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I’ve got to tell you the truth here because I’m under oath 
and if I don’t, I told you before what my wife will do to me, but the fact of the matter is I 
must be honest with you, it is true the prisoners were used to do the cooking of the 
food, but in that specific contract there was training and development done which was 
phenomenal, and half of the training and development done was – and I’m not just 
saying that, I could sit here and tell you it was a rubbish contract and all that, no the 
training and development done I think saw in my time 60 000 offenders being trained in 
the food industry, on national accredited courses, so that contract is a bit difficult.  For 
20 
Mr Bloem to say you know that they were ripped off, it’s a long debate and I don’t think 
we should go into it today because in actual fact, I will give you an example, that 
Correctional Services would fill up the courts about complaints with regards to food, 
and people and offenders taking the Department to court all the time, since it was done 
by a professional catering company we were able to reduce it down to zero, there were 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 45 of 191 
 
no complaints. 
 
Another thing that you must consider is that for some or other reason you 
know when you’re working for a company you work on a bonus and a retention basis 
and incentive basis you tend to be more controlling over the stores and over the 
purchase prices and things like that, and sometimes Corrections let it slip, so to say as 
a blanket on that specific contract it wasn’t worth while well there was never ever a riot 
because of the quality of the food, so I can’t fault Bosasa there, personally, I knew it ,I 
was involved with it, so on that contract I can’t. 
 
Was it expensive, Chair it’s expensive to shop at Woolworths but when you 
buy at Woolworths you can eat everything that they provide you with, there’s no peels, 
10 
there’s no cabbages, the leaves and all that, and I’m not advocating Woolworths, I’m 
just giving an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On that note Chair is it a good time to take the 
short adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it is.  That issue relating to value for money certainly in regard to 
Correctional Services where I had the evidence that I had from Mr Bloem should be 
investigated further and at some stage I would like to know what the true position is, so 
we need not deal with it or exhaust it now, but at some stage I would like that I hear 
evidence from different people as to exactly what value, if any, Bosasa brought, and 
20 
exactly in what way and what was happening. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, for example Chair if a Department allows 
a gross profit margin of close on 40% how this fits in with the norm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, definitely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we will investigate. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 46 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and of course I think we heard from Mr Bloem also that 
Correctional Services has got their own farms where they produce food and so on and 
he was asking so one needs to know if they use food that they produce on their farms 
and inmates were being used to cook and so on,  how did all that – how did that affect 
the price that may have been charged by Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair, so at some stage that should be 
looked at, but we will take the short adjournment for now, we will resume at half past 
eleven.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we just waiting for Mr Agrizzi to arrive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the meanwhile Chair it is my error may I ask 
that Mr Witz who represents Mr Agrizzi places himself on record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay he did not do so before but he – maybe he – even if he did 
maybe he should again in case. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying I was asking whether he did not do so before. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Let us do that. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:   Yes morning Chair sorry I have not done it before.  I was here in 
January. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 47 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:     For Mr Agrizzi I was also here for Mr Van Tonder. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
 ADV DANIEL WITZ:    Andries and Leon and Mr Vorster and Mr Richard Le Roux. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:     I act on behalf of all of them and I am acting on behalf on Mr 
Agrizzi today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:     And I am instructed by Witz Incorporated who are the 
instructing attorneys and I am an advocate and I appear for Mr Agrizzi. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV DANIEL WITZ:     Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we will have to adjourn.  Okay.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:    I do know that when we adjourned on my watch the time was about 
seventeen minutes / sixteen minutes / seventeen minutes past? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Eighteen I looked carefully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh eighteen – so maybe I did not give everybody a full fifteen 
minutes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we will manage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies Chair. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 48 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Normally they fetch me and I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I normally keep time but I did not this time I forgot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies, sorry… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I probably robbed people of two or three minutes 
of the break.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizza before we got to paragraph 14 I am 
told that there may have been some confusion about the total amounts in paragraph 12 
10 
and 13 of your statement.  The total amount of historical contracts between 2000 and 
2016 as you have referred to them the value of the contracts is over R2 billion? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the value of the bribes, the estimated 
bribes paid in relation to those contracts is R66 million approximately? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Plus the R9.4 million set out.  So it is about R75 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that would be in paragraph 13 the 
continuing contracts? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. The – I just want to clarify.  The word continuing 
contracts should not be there but because I am not very good on computers. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When I typed I just copied and pasted another table so on my 
draft which I submitted to yourselves it had on the one page the first batch of names 
and on the second page it had this one.  So it is all one table but because I am not that 
great I – it split up now. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 49 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – just so that I understand that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the way you had done it was the position that you were simply 
looking at all contracts that were in existence at some stage or another between 2000 
and 2016? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So to clarify for Advocate Pretorius as well so it should be one 
10 
table. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One table? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is only split because I am not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I mean I have had to do – I do not have a PA anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I had to do this all myself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in other words if one deletes the headings 
and I do not suggest we do that now informally Chair.  If one deletes the headings and 
places one table it would more accurately reflect what you intended to put in this table? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will explain that perhaps in a 
supplementary note Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am making a note that says I should ignore this heading at 13. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 50 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just deleting the two headings would – 
would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am avoiding deleting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or putting a note. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I making a note. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Next to the heading which says delete.  But we 
will explain that in a supplementary note from [indistinct] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is alright.  That is alright thank you.  So therefore viewed 
in that way Mr Agrizzi it makes sense for you to say the total should be one that takes 
into account both totals that are in the two columns? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  The second issue which was 
raised with you briefly Mr Agrizzi over the short adjournment you can assist the Chair in 
relation to the topic value for money. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will investigate it more thoroughly. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But in relation to the question of the use of the 
prisons farms you do have some information from your own personal knowledge? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I have got to be frank and open about it.  The problem 
you have is that sometimes bureaucracy prevents people from performing at their best.  
So what was happening is that for instance yes they have the farms but the farms for 
instance would have problems.  They would not get seeds on time so they could not 
plant stuff.  They would not get the right feeds for the pigs that they produce at 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75

Waterval.  They did not have processing plants.  So you know those were all 
hindrances that they picked up.  I mean I remember at Waterval I put up a processing 
plant free of charge for them because we making good money but also because if I look 
after the raw material from the farm it saves costs in the long run to – you see that kind 
of impact is not there unfortunately with the people that were there.  They had been in 
corrections all their years.  They have done it a certain way and it was not as effective 
as it could be.  So the ultimate result being is that through efficiencies by bringing in a 
private company or individuals that have been in that business all their life and the 
bread and butter is made out of how much money you can save.  I will give you a 
simple example.  If you serve 30 grams at correctional services more chicken than you 
10 
supposed to – let me rather use the word beef.  Beef or protein.  30 grams is literally 
the size of my thumb.  Do you know that that 30 grams you escalate it now.  You say 
well times that by 240 000 offenders I do not have a calculator and I am damn good – 
bad at maths – but 240 000 times 30 grams comes to say I do not know about probably 
about 4 tons, do not quote please but 4 tons at the going rate of R30,00 per kilo it is a 
considerable amount – it is nearly R120 000,00 a day.  And that is only on one product.  
So with the result being with all the little slips and that that they had in corrections they 
were losing phenomenal amount of money.  When I did the initial surveys which I 
thought was the blueprints right in 2000, the beginning of 2004 – I give you an example. 
Westville Prison their catering costs were in excess of R29,00 per person per day which 
20 
sounds – geez that sounds cheap but bear in mind the initial cost that Bosasa charged 
the department was R10.55 per person per day.  So there is such a big disparity that I 
cannot openly say now no they never got value for money.  They did get value for 
money in that contract.  There are – yes if they had called in other contract companies 
they probably might have got it for R9.00 or for R8.00 a day but if you have to compare 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 52 of 191 
 
corrections and private catering I must be frank with you it is cheaper to outsource. And 
I have written papers on it and I can provide that.  But I recall also writing an article for 
Mr Lukas Muntingh who is involved with prisons and that and they will tell you the 
quality of the food prevented a lot of other issues like courts, arraignments and that 
type of thing.  So in terms of what Mr Bloem said was a hundred percent right that the 
offender are being used but rather use them, train them up, skill them up and you know 
sometimes it becomes embarrassing but skill them up, train them.  I walked into KFC 
the other day and one of the offenders ‘oh Mr Agrizzi the last time I saw you I was in 
prison’ and everybody looks at you as if you were in prison but he was one of the guys 
that had been trained and developed.  So you know that had its benefits as well.  So I 
10 
cannot openly say – with other contracts I can tell you where people did not get value 
for money at all.  But in general yes but there are – in this specific contract there was 
value for money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You had two examples of the quality of the 
produce from the farms of Correctional Services they illustrate the point I think that you 
were making.  Tell the Chair about those. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know if I should not on live TV. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please do. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Maybe we should do it camera.  But the one was for instance 
20 
Waterval as pigs and they grow pork.  And pork was a thing in the prisons that number 
1 prisoners do not like pork and the other thing was if you do not – if you do not feed 
the pigs correctly they put on fat and they kind of look like me but..  What – happening 
we were getting pork that had like six centimetres or ten centimetres of fat on it that I 
would reject because – and the only reason for that is because the bureaucracy would 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 53 of 191 
 
prevent the guys from getting the correct feeds, getting the veterinary services out there 
and all that type of thing.  And if you look at cabbages.  Pollsmoor had a phenomenal 
problem with vegetables because what was happening was you were not actually 
transporting vegetables because they just deliver it in a truck and you basically shifting 
sand from the prison farm in Pollsmoor to Malmesbury.  All you doing is shifting sand 
and you might get cabbages with it.  So one of the initiatives put there was to say – 
because we were compelled to buy from the prison farms.  One of the initiatives there 
was to be able to set up a production plant where we used lady offenders in the 
production plant to actually pre-prepare the vegetables and to actually leave the soil on 
the ground and actually pre-cut the vegetables, make jams and things like that.  So 
10 
from that perspective there was benefit as well.  What I will do is I will – I will send the 
investigations team some of the synopsis that I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But there were other areas that yes there was no value for 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we move then Mr Agrizzi to paragraph 14 
of your statement? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were asked specifically to deal with the 
20 
quantity of cash deliveries to Ms Nomvula Mokonyane and the values of those cash 
deliveries and in particular you were asked what were you involved with personally and 
what did you personally observe?  Please tell the Chair about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair on a monthly basis there would R50 000,00 packed.  
That was – it was done.  There were two occasions that I was there when it was 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 54 of 191 
 
received. The one occasion was we were – we had to attend to a problem – I think it 
was with Walter Sisulu school, Walter Sisulu place of safety that had a major issue and 
we needed to move children around and that and at that stage we went to the Premier’s 
property and I remember it vividly driving up and the beautiful place in Bryanston and 
we were taken in.  Before that we had packed the R50 000,00 in a grey security bag.  
We were taken in.  You go through big doors and then we sat in a lounge and in a 
waiting area.  And then you got the entrance hall and there was another on the right 
hand side there was like a massive – it looked like a dining hall come conference room, 
massive.  And she was sitting at the head of the table.  There was a chair free.  There 
was Mr Watson sitting there.  I sat next to him.  On the opposite side there was Ms 
10 
Hlophe I think she was the MEC at that stage for Social Services if I remember 
correctly and there were some other people.  And Tannie Makoko was actually with us 
as well.  And we had the meeting.  We discussed everything and it went until late at 
night and at that stage everybody was starting to walk out and Gavin then left the bag 
next to the – took the envelope out of the bag or the bag out of the bag and put it on the 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if you voice is going down so… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry I am – no it is not this is the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So then took the bag from the bag and left the bag on the 
20 
chair next to it.  You know that I can attest to that is what happened on that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The second one was I was present at the house… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you cannot remember around about when that was? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot hey. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 55 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I can only say that it was when she was Premier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And because I remember the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Vividly and I remember the – I remember the – the situation 
that led to the meeting that night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then there was the second time which was in the house in 
Krugersdorp.  Krugersdorp or Roodepoort I am not – I know where the house and I can 
10 
tell you the address but they told me to take out the address but I remember it 
happening there when it was handed over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know then there were other occasions where he would – 
where Watson would be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the one that you – you are not telling us about is that because 
you previously dealt with it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which one is that?  There are two occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one was in Bryanston 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You told us the details about the one. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  And the other one was in Krugersdorp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So there is much detail really.  It is was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 56 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was in the meeting – it was – it actually you know just 
happened like oh we coming for a meeting and then we going to hand over.  You know 
so that was – that was – those are the times I can remember vividly what actually 
happened.  But then there was occasions where I would be told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. This last one seems rather vague you know.  You say 
come for a – did you somebody ask you let us go to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So and so’s house for a meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what – I think… 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give us more … 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would never… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is quite vague. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would never go on my own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the rule was very simple that you do not – that was Gavin’s 
deal and Gavin would deal with her.  I – I got occasionally a phone call to do something 
or do this or do that occasionally when she – when Gavin’s phone was off.  So that 
was… 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I may just interrupt 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi you are being invited to give as 
much detail about the second occasion as you can recollect. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well you know I can recollect the house and I can recollect 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 57 of 191 
 
that there was a meeting that we were going to attend and I cannot remember what the 
meeting was about sorry I just cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember – was money given to her on that occasion? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know how much it was? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was R50 000,00 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R50,000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R50 000,00 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I remember the amounts. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did you get involved in packing the money? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The money was packed the day before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not by you or by you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no the money was not packed by me it was packed by 
Gavin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And was it given to her in your presence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or… 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I can tell you where. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was in her study. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As you walk through the front door. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 58 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You turn right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay there is a desk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And there is a whole lot of memorabilia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And memorabilia on the back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And she came down from upstairs. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Downstairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And at that time was she still the Premier? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She was not the Premier at that stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether she was a MEC or was she a Minister? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it was MEC I cannot recall exactly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but she was not Premier as you recall? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well if you look at paragraphs 14.3 and 14.4.  
In 14.3 you say there was a second occasion when you were present when money was 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 59 of 191 
 
delivered? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then in 14.4 you say that Watson told you 
that he was en route to the Premier at her house in Krugersdorp? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  I was under the impression Chair was asking 
the question asked was, was I present, when was I present?  I was present on those 
two occasions. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And she was Premier on both those 
10 
occasions? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  On the first occasion I remember she was a Premier because 
we went to what is noted the Premier’s house.  The second occasion I cannot 
remember is she was still a Premier or a MEC.  I still – I can tell you that at that specific 
time I think she was more involved with elections at that stage so it might have been 
that period of time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you refer to the Premier in paragraph 14.4 
that is the point I am making. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay but is the second – the first question you asked me is, 
you asked me if Chair let me get this right in my head.  The first question is when were 
20 
you present?  I was present on those two occasions that I am reading.  So on the third 
occasion on 14.4 alright I was not present when he gave it.  I was present when he was 
en route I had to meet him and hand over to him and he told me he is going there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you referring to three occasions or two? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well two when I was present and the third occasion I was not 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 60 of 191 
 
present when he handed it over but I was present when I gave it to him to take to her.  
Am I clear?  I just follow you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes it is just that the statement is slightly 
different from that but we hear what you saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just – sorry I just want to clarify there.  I say often Gavin would 
request me to pack an amount of R50 000,00 in a security bag.  I recall at one stage 
that Watson was in a rush and told me that he was en route to the Premier at her 
house.  At that stage the Premier was Nomvula Mokonyane.  I did this and gave him the 
package.  He wanted to discuss the SIU matter as a matter of urgency.  But I never said 
10 
I went with him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So I understand now 14.2 is one 
occasion. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  14.3 is another occasion. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And 14.4 is yet another third occasion. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So 14.2 is when I was present.  14.3 is when I was present.  
14.4 I was not present. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  14.5 I am present but there is no cash. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so – thank you for clearing that up.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you Chair.  Is it clear? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So you have made it clear on what occasions 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 61 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You actually saw cash – saw the money 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Being handed over or being left – handed over to her or being left in 
her house? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And another occasion you participated – or you gave the money to 
Mr Gavin Watson who told you that he was going to see her? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but you were not there at the meeting that he would have had 
with her and therefore you did not see – you do not know whether on that occasion it 
10 
was handed over to her or not? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 14.5 you deal with benefits 
other than cash. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Being provided to Ms Mokonyane? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Won’t you tell the Chair about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it was one specific day that we were called to a meeting 
20 
and it was early in the morning – I think it was the morning – ja it was early in the 
morning.  And I got a call.  I was actually busy with something and when you got a call 
from Gavin you dropped everything and especially if it was the Premier drop it all.  I 
was actually in a meeting and I had to leave everything and go.  So I went with him.  
We actually went in the same car.  His car and it was Porsche Cayenne Turbo S.  And I 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 62 of 191 
 
would always drive the car when I was with him because I get car sick if I am driven 
around.  And basically there was a lot of work that needed to be done.  She was there 
and her PA was there as well, Sandy Thomas I think her name was.  And basically there 
were a lot of things wrong.  The CCTV cameras were not working.  The shed where the 
police guarding her was falling apart.  The electric fence was not working.  It had been 
overgrown with leaves and trees and that.  The swimming pool was green and there 
was a lot of issues with regards to lighting.  Every second light bulb was out.  I 
remember the floor lighting which is a special bulb that we had to get on the entrance 
was missing.  And a lot of things were missing so we went there and we then phoned 
up Richard le Roux who was then told to come and fix and he was instructed to fix.  I 
10 
mean the generator, the auto switch on the generator was not working.  We had to call 
in the specialist for that.  But every time there was something wrong it was a phone call 
and it would get sorted out.  Irrespective of cost it would get done.  So even like the 
gardening stuff had to be sorted out.  I remember getting a guy – our gardener Marius 
to go there and to clean up the gardens and all that.  So it is very difficult for me to 
quantify the costs now it is a couple of years later.  But you looking at about 
R350/R400 000,00.  I mean new camera systems, electric fence, generator, all that 
type of stuff used to be done.  Does that clarify for you? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Then in paragraph 14.6 you talk about 
arranging and paying for functions. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yup. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you tell the Chair about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair we – we always used to I believed in do it 
properly and do it to the best of our ability.  So we would just get requests and Gavin 
did not debate these type of issues.  He did not want to know whether the people want 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 63 of 191 
 
to work on a weekend or a Sunday night or -  I will give you an example.  I got a call on 
a Friday – on a Thursday evening at 7:30 and I get told I have got to provide lunch 
packs which must include a piece of chicken, four slices of bread, jam, a juice, energy 
bar and fruit.  It must be tomorrow morning at six o’clock must be delivered to – it was 
University of Johannesburg’s campus.  That is the type of requests.  And you would 
have to just do it and make it work.  And God forbid if you do not because you will have 
him – and on that specific occasion I remember there were at UJ here and it was the 
wrong address they had given us.  It was supposed to be UJ I think in Soweto.  So we 
would have to jump and do this type of functions. Lekgotlas we have done I think I have 
got more T-shirts on the ANC in my cupboard than I need.  Because every time you got 
10 
there you got a free t-shirt.  So I got t-shirts and caps that I have got enough for a 
couple of years still.  But we would have to do those functions.  Syanoba rallies.  We 
did them.  All free of charge.  There was never ever a charge.  You never ever dared 
ask him are we going to recover this money.  There were funerals, personal funerals 
done.  All hours of the night, that type of thing.  So all that would be at Bosasa’s costs 
and it is fact you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the packs that you talked about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have prepared for, was it vets or UJ for that particular 
Friday morning six am.  Would that have been like food parcels or food that was going 
20 
to be given to people who were attending some meeting or rally or something? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it was always rallies and it was not just the pack put it 
together like you buy like the typical street food we can buy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not that.   
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 64 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This had to be in a foma tray and then you had to have the 
logo’s printed on a sticker.  So we had to have a sticker on that with the function and 
who was involved or whatever or the naming configuration.  It had to be done properly it 
was really you know it was top class. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  But if you were on this particular occasion you given a call 
Friday early evening or evening… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thursday evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was to be.  Sorry on Thursday? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thursday evening. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Thursday evening oh ja on Thursday evening and this was to be 
ready for 6 am you must have or your people must have worked quite hard throughout 
the night to get ready? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot – Chair I cannot tell you how many nights I personally 
have worked with the team.  I mean you talking having to keep people back 20/30 
people because you got to pack 5 or 10 000 packs at a time you know.  I mean it is a 
logistical – it used to be a logistical nightmare for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And maybe what the commission should do is approach one 
of the people that I put in charge to do that and they will give you all the facts.  But the 
20 
fact of the matter is it was a cost.  It was a major, major cost to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Well give the information  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the legal team and the investigators. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 65 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then Mr Agrizzi in the paragraphs 14.8 to 
14.13 or 14.12 you deal again with evidence regarding the provision of hire vehicles for 
Ms Mokonyane’s daughter.  You do not have to repeat that evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja.  Chair if I may?  If I may ask you that I do not want really 
discuss children and that. I can just give you a brief overview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There is so many times that I would have to – because I do 
not feel that you know it is right to mention children in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I – there were many occasions where I would get a call, 
you organise this one’s daughter a car and organise that one’s daughter a car or that 
one’s daughter a car.  This is one of those situations.  You know costs here would be 
between 80 and sometimes R150 000,00 and there is a whole lot of other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That go with it.  There are accidents. There are demands.  
There is all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So, yes that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The facts are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but you say now you are asked to organise this or that for this 
one’s daughter? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or this one’s daughter.  So far we have only from you evidence in 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 66 of 191 
 
regard to the daughter of one politician as far as I remember.  Are you suggesting that 
you have personal knowledge of children of other politicians who might have been 
benefited in the same way as the daughter of this particular politician that you have 
testified about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there are numerous examples.  I have tried to give you 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I mentioned it right from the beginning that there is just 
not enough time.  We are always under pressure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Getting the stuff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To you and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To get it.  I have started writing up everything else, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  These things just carry on and carry on, you know I mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall now there is another one, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Jogs your memory.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not want to, I will probably.

CHAIRPERSON:  You will. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sit and finish off, but I mention in the previous one I think it 
was Mr Vincent Smith’s daughter as well who had a vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes you did, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do mention that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then I mention this one here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then there is another one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But you know it only comes to mind when you start really 
talking about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know, bearing in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know these are prepared very quickly and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know we write them down, write them down, write them 
20 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay.  Well if and when you remember or you see 
something that reminds you of things that are relevant, you know, let the legal team or 
investigators know. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  You will understand Mr Agrizzi if we have 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 68 of 191 
 
evidence available as investigators and the legal team of some that have been omitted 
we should bring that forward in fairness to all. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if you do have any direct recollection at the 
moment please feel free to tell the Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, you know the problem is I do not purposefully omit them 
and I do not want to do that.  I want to be frank and open, but I remember now 
Richmond Mti’s kids that would get flights and tickets and cars and then there is, I 
cannot remember the name now of the child, but I will [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, you have got Patrick Gillingham’s 
10 
children. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh yes, no that was I mean that was a given. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know then there is for instance one of the ex-Chairman of 
the companies and I do not want to really mention his name, because I first want to 
check my facts, but I know that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you are not sure it might be. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Better if you check your facts and then give the information to them 
and then I know that you have no problem coming back if need be, but. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  See what you, if it is something that is important and that you have 
personal knowledge of give it to them and we take it from there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know with the greatest respect Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 69 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is very difficult, because I do not have documentation.  I 
work off my memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I work off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then I go and look for the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then I find the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I go and search for them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I phone up people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I get the documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That corroborates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because I would hate to implicate somebody here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Guilty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So with the result being is that for instance avenues get 
blocked for me. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 70 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I mentioned this morning to the investigators I am busy with a 
cellphone record, but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  How I have had to fish and try and get my old cellphone 
records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because all that information is being blocked off by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You must remember and I attest to it where I have asked even 
10 
the old attorneys for information.  They refuse to give me the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So as I get the information that is when I put it in an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But yes I am trying to wrack my brain to think of absolutely 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because I also want to get closure on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no it is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I think once they get the right information and I can tell 
them where to go find it. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 71 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And once they have found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then I can put it all together for them.  That is not a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the investigators and the legal team should be able to assist. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of what legally needs to be done for you or the Commission 
to get the information that is important for the Commission.  So I know you are in touch 
with them.  So. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do talk to them to say I am having difficulty finding this information.  
Is there a way in which the legal team or the investigators can help and they should be 
able to help most of the time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will give you, if I may, I will give you an example Chair is 
where SARS for instance, they are busy now with an investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the liquidators, I tell them exactly where to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then they go and get that information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then they ask me to help piece it together for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So that is where I can be of assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I will assist. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 72 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then in paragraph 14.14 you repeat but 
in summary form that the purchases of food products, meat hampers, liquor and other 
items that you set out in your original affidavit as deliveries to Ms Mokonyane that 
would be done on an annual basis. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say here without fail? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and if I understand correctly that is in answer to the 
question that was put to me by the chair on how many deliveries took place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And how often. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall over what period that would have 
taken place approximately? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  10 years. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  10 years you say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you have testified that in relation to 
Ms Mokonyane and I presume others as well that you would receive requests from time 
to time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have looked for written evidence as I 
understand it of such a request? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One example is Annexure FF which appears 
on page 79 of Bundle S9? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 73 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The email chain begins on page 80 and 
continues through to page 79. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not very clear from the documentation 
what has happened here.  Perhaps you should explain that to the Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I can explain it.  I remember this specific incident vaguely.  
What happened was I would get requests like this all the time.  Now once more 
unfortunately why this looks the way it does is because all my emails were deleted but 
luckily there was an archive folder where a lot of the things were kept by a person who I 
10 
do not want to mention their name, because they have been victimised already and 
they are on the inside and I have had to use those tactics to get things like this to prove 
my case and I am not just a blithering fool and lying in front of everybody and so this 
was for instance a request and then this person would be told listen you go deal with 
Bosasa.  They will sort it out.  They will help you with everything that you need, but this 
is just one of those emails.  This one relays to somebody needing help with purchasing 
of equipment and importing equipment as well and you know you feel obliged to do this, 
because the person has been sent to you and your boss is telling you listen you better 
get it sorted out.  You do not know how you are going to sort it out, but you are being 
told you will sort it out.  So this is the type of things that we have to do. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the interesting thing is this family have no money.  There 
is a bunch of investors in all the hotels, but there is no one to help them jump there.  
They went to the wrong door instead.  I mean so our doors were like knocked on all the 
time. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 74 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well the original request in the email dated 
Tuesday 
3 April 
is 
then 
forwarded 
via 
an 
Ms Ndaba 
to 
yourself 
from 
Nomvula Mokonyane. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that appears at the top of the page? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So this request was just passed on to you it 
seems. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To attend to. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And what would happen is Gavin Watson would get a call from 
her and say listen sort this out and I would get the call from Mr Watson or I would 
sometimes get a call directly to say sort this out. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Right, there is a direct communication.  
It appears on Friday 13 April 2012 in relation to the contents of this email chain from 
Nomvula Mokonyane directly to yourself? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you were asked about the need for and 
the reason for the continued assistance given to Ms Mokonyane after the direct 
relationships that you have spoken about previously and her connections as Premier 
20 
had ceased.  Do you see that in paragraph 15? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why did the relationship between Bosasa and 
Ms Mokonyane continue and how did it continue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well you must remember something and some people are 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 75 of 191 
 
very powerful in politics, alright.  I am sitting here on national TV telling you this Chair, 
but it is scary because people have the ability and I have experienced it first hand to do 
a lot of things.  I have seen it happen in that company.  I have seen prosecutions being 
stalled.  I have seen things that you know that just boggles your mind and one of them 
is this where through very powerful and I was told categorically that you do not mess.  
You just do and you do not argue.  One example, I will give you an example is that I 
walked into a meeting and I asked the question afterwards why, what benefit is there for 
us.  Not knowing that there is a whole lot of other things happening on the side and it 
always confused me and then I picked up on Annexure GG and I realised geez Angelo 
you are blind, because there is a classic example of how this is a major product.  
10 
Bosasa is small fry.  These are major products.  Now this is why Watson was always 
looking after the Premier at that stage or the MEC Nomvula Mokonyane.  So it refers to 
a windfarm that has been the subject of major controversy that I have tried to stay away 
from because I did not want to get involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May I ask you to speak closer to the mic. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Your voice drops if you move away. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 76 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, so the big thing was for me the SIU case that we were 
told was closed and that I remember at one stage when we were running the call centre 
for the elections that we walked down the passage near the lodge and she said to me, 
she turned around, I was walking with Gavin.  He had been in a meeting with her and 
she had turned around and said you know do not worry about it, because I kept asking 
because I was concerned about it.   Do not worry, it is closed. You do not need to worry, 
but you are worried about the press.  She said do not worry about the press.  The thing 
is closed.  Nothing is going to happen.  So that was where the power was, but then I 
found out that in actual fact it was a little bit more than that.  The long term plans are 
always there in the background and the windfarm was a very controversial issue.  As a 
10 
matter of fact I met with the person who originally was going to do the EIA for the 
windfarm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  EIA being? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The EIA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that stands for? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Environmental Impact Assessment.  So with any big project 
you have to do that.  So I know that it is a multi-billion Rand deal.  I know that for a fact.  
I know for a fact that everything was done to circumvent the rules of the EIA to make it 
hurry up and this was a common trend with the Watsons.  You would worry about that 
later, you know.  The company that owns the windfarm is Ronnie Watson, 
20 
Valence Watson, Jared Watson and Ronnie Watson’s daughter, Tandy Snead and I then 
remember that Gavin was also involved in this whole thing and then I saw the article on 
13 March which refers to this and I got a call to say now you know why this whole thing 
is happening.  So in Annexure GG and maybe you want to refer to it you will see that 
Inyanda Energy Projects, Laidback Investments and I recall Laidback Investments 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 77 of 191 
 
because Tony Perry always mentioned it.  He was the company secretary at one stage 
and I always remember Laidback Investments in the vault.  I always remember seeing 
the file, Laidback Investments.  So I knew; that to me was the link between Bosasa and 
then you now if you look at the actual report it tells you the whole story. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Before we go to Annexure GG which we 
will do in a moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi, let us just sketch the background.  
In the Eastern Cape is a large property? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Surrounded by a nature reserve? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  It is known for the black eagles or I think the eagles 
that are in that area. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and we know that windfarms and bird life 
particularly eagles do not get on very well with one another? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the establishment of a windfarm on this 
property is an environmentally sensitive issue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Very. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Very and for that reason an Environmental 
20 
Impact Assessment would have to be done and it would have to go through certain 
official channels? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which we will come to in a moment.  The 
members of the Watson family are involved in several companies which apparently own 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 78 of 191 
 
manage the land? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us then go to Annexure GG having 
sketched that background.  Annexure GG is on page 82.  This is an article that 
appeared on 13 March 2019 under the by-line of John Yeld of GroundUp presumably an 
environmental person. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it deals with the windfarm issue, the 
Watsons and the Minister of Communications Nomvula Mokonyane or at that time the 
Minister of Communications.  She subsequently became at a relevant time the Minister 
10 
of Environmental Affairs. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  If one goes to page 83 and looks, one 
looks at the second paragraph of that article one has a high level description of the 
project plan.  It reads: 
“The plan is 47 turbines, each 85 metres high and with 130 
metres diameter blades on top of the Groot Winterhoek 
Mountain Range at an altitude of about 1 000 metres.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “The farm would be situated on 21 
20 
parcels of land totalling about 12 200 hectares between three 
portions of Groendal Nature Reserve.” 
You know that for a fact do you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The next paragraph reads: 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 79 of 191 
 
“Groendal is a provincial nature reserve and the surrounding 
Groendal Wilderness area is protected under the National 
Forestry Act.” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then the next paragraph importantly reads: 
“The project proposal drew strong objections from amongst 
other the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, the Eastern 
Cape’s Department of Economic Development Environment 
and Tourism, BirdLife South Africa, Wilderness Foundation 
Africa and the Elands River Conservancy.” 
10 
Then we read: 
“But the windfarm received the environmental go ahead from 
the National Department of Environmental Affairs in April last 
year.  This decision is now under appeal.” 
Who would hear that appeal? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So she in her capacity as Minister of 
Environmental Affairs would be scheduled to hear that appeal in relation to this 
windfarm in which the Watsons are involved? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well that is where the concern was. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then the article actually mentions a few 
paragraphs down just above the heading “The Bosasa Story”. 
“Mokonyane should be preparing to consider the appeals, but 
she may be facing a significant conflict of interest that should 
disqualify her from making appeal decision.” 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 80 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So on the evidence we have Ms Mokonyane is 
receiving benefits from Bosasa and is now dealing with an appeal relating to the 
Watsons and the windfarm? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Her response to any allegation of conflict of 
interest is on page 84 of the article which has a heading in the middle of the page “No 
Conflict of Interest says Minister’s Office”.  Then the conflict of interest is set out in the 
first paragraph under that heading and the second paragraph under that heading reads: 
“Mokonyane has indicated through her spokesperson Ndamase 
10 
that she will not withdraw from the adjudication process.” 
The spokesman says in response to questions by the environmental organisation 
GroundUp and I read again: 
“There is no conflict of interest that arises in the above matter 
as the Department must apply its regulations and legal 
prescripts to all appeals without prejudice based on Directors 
and/or owners of companies involved in the appeal process.  
The Minister acts and exercises her powers within the 
parameters of such process.” 
And then there is a comment strongly to the contrary by Professor Pierre de Vos of 
20 
UCT but we need not go there because we need not go there because we now 
venturing into the realm of legal opinion, but for the moment to summarise the Watsons 
have an interest in an environmentally controversial windfarm and Nomvula Mokonyane 
will make the final decision about whether that project can go ahead or not.? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is as it is put out. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 81 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  We need not take that issue then any 
further for the present at least.  Let us then go back to your statement if we may 
Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The further reason for the continued 
relationship between Bosasa on the one hand and Ms Mokonyane on the other is dealt 
with by you in paragraph 15.3 and following? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Tell the Chair about that please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair on numerous occasions there were meetings.  I mean 
10 
there were discussions between Mokonyane and Watson regarding the SIU and the 
one issue was we go to a meeting with Mr Richmond Mti and he would say to us that 
Jiba had said to him that they need to bring the file back to, I do not understand how it 
works, but they would have to bring the file back to the NPA and Anwar Dramat must 
release the file.  It was stories like that.  I do not know the processes, but there was 
constant pressure that a meeting had to happen with her and Anwar Dramat and he 
was then the National Head of the Hawks and this was too make sure that the Bosasa 
matter gets returned to Advocate Jiba’s offices so that she can arrange for the matter 
not to be prosecuted.  That is what; I was in those meetings.  That is what I heard and 
the pressure was put on by Gavin to Nomvula Mokonyane to say Dramat must give you 
20 
back the files.  You go have a meeting now with him and I believe a meeting took place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You refer in paragraph 15.4 to a meeting 
attended by yourself, Joe Gumede and Gavin Watson where the involvement of 
Nomvula Mokonyane was discussed.  What were you told at that meeting about 
involvement with Ms Mokonyane? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 82 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I tend to push things to a point and I investigate and I 
check and I check and I check and I started questioning things.  I started saying but 
why are we doing this guys, you know.  It is not helping us.  Let us become apolitical or 
whatever.  We do not need this.  I mean, we are doing well without this.  Why do we 
need it now and I was told listen, back off.  You do not understand everything and 
Gavin used to refer whenever I brought this up he would speak in Xhosa and say 
(Xhosa words).  I do not know what that means to today, but he also used the words 
(Xhosa words), you know as shoving me off and then afterwards he would phone and 
apologise but it was clear that he did not want anybody interfering with her or stopping 
anything that was his political ally and he wanted them kept close. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraphs 15.5 to 15.7 you mention a little 
out of sequence because we are going. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To return to Ms Mokonyane in a minute, other 
politicians mentioned or related to in one form or another Bosasa and Mr Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I have, what happened there was and it has been so 
many times they would always threaten me with politicians, always threaten me.  You 
know, I know people in the Hawks, I know this one I know that one and there I was told 
once straight out listen here Jacob Zuma’s kids I do not know which ones, I do not 
know which wife.  I think with, not Kate I cannot remember, but basically those kids are 
20 
very close to Valence’s kids, Jared Watson and Daniel Watson and those kids of 
Valence Watson and this would be brought up quite regularly.  I recall the night where 
they tried to buy me out.  Ronnie Watson who was in Intelligence previously, I do not 
know his whole history, he actually said to me I have got counter intelligence on you.  I 
know exactly what is happening.  You know, so it was always that threat and we know 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 83 of 191 
 
this person.  That person knows that person.  We will deal with you, you know.  So that 
is why I mentioned it in there that there was very close confidence to them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Can we move then to paragraph 15.8 
unless you have anything to add in relation to 15.5 to 15.7? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. I think that is pretty simple.  I mean it was the whole issue 
with regards to the shares in Vulisango that was held by Siviwe Mapisa on behalf of 
Nosiviwe Mapisa.  I think that and we do not need to go into depth. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us then if we may to paragraph 15.11.  In 
15. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Mr, can I just add something as well and I think it is 
10 
pretty important? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To mention it, because it is a concern.  The one thing is that 
you must remember that this is an example of how the Watsons ensured that they had 
the most powerful people in the country as their connections and friends.  So sitting 
here today I am very vulnerable like I was last time, because those connections and 
friends are widespread.  I do not even know all of them, but I am just saying that I was 
told so many times categorically that they are the most politically connected people in 
South Africa.  Sorry Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  If you want to add anything in 15.8, 15.9 
20 
and 15.10 to your verbal evidence please feel free to do so. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In other words a specific, there was a specific time I went to 
Italy on a tour and Joe Gumede joined me and Gavin Watson joined me.  So it was my 
tour, but I took them with and at that actual meeting I used that opportunity to broaden 
our scope on the business because we were away and we could talk openly with each 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 84 of 191 
 
other and I asked the question you know why, again one of them Nomvula Mokonyane, 
why be political and I was told categorially I was actually scolded to shut up and just do 
as I am told to do and that was one of the things.  You know, and at that stage 
Jacob Zuma I remember was the servicing President, but that was the situation that we 
have to deal with and that is where the concern regarding state capture really came in.  
I think that covers it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Let us deal with paragraph 15.11 
because shortly after you gave evidence here for the first time in January. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  An article appeared in the press with 
10 
photographs in fact a short video of what became known as the Bosasa Call Centre. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The War Room. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The War Room.  Tell the Chair about that.  
What this War Room was?  How it came about that Bosasa funded and created this?  
How it was run and who was involved please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well involved in it I think at that stage in 2000, there are so 
many of them, but if I recall back the 2014 one because for example there was the 
Mangahong one where that was run a call centre in a War Room for Jacob Zuma and 
then there as the 2014 one which was run for I think it was local elections or national 
elections.  I cannot even recall, you know Chair I kind of distanced myself from the 
20 
nitty-gritty of that, I would be told sort this out, get it running and I would get it running, 
but I wouldn’t visit there, I wouldn’t even go there to see how it was doing and that, I 
would send one of the juniors, because nine out of ten times this consumed the whole 
company for up to two/three months at a time.  
 
So in 2014 if you’re referring to war room ...(intervention)  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 85 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014 was the national elections, 2016 was the local government 
elections. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s right, so it was done in 2014 and in 2016.  So in this 
specific instance I remember that we had to arrange the one section which is about a 
30 seater call centre, so there’s a massive call centre there, one half of the call centre 
deals with government fleet contracts, Corona, the other half deals with – it was empty 
at this stage, it was originally built to deal with the integration of CCTV access controls 
for the Department of Justice and Correctional Services to bring everything together as 
one whole unit and that never happened but what happened is, I was told, listen just kit 
it out.  New computers, new video walls, you know like the wall you’ve got behind you 
10 
with the – about that size video walls had to be put up, literally get like a week or two 
weeks to do it.  Branding has to go up, has to become ANC it has to – you have to 
convert the lodge for volunteers to stay at the lodge, you’ve got to provide food for them 
three times a day because some Ministers are there,  you need to make sure that the 
security is in place, all that type of thing had to be done on a regular basis and, you 
know, if I asked a question it was, SIU matter my friend, shut up just do it, if you do this 
everything will go away and we get away where there’s business we can get that type 
of thing.  So that’s basically the war room that was set up but the cost of the war room, 
to run it, I mean, we eventually ended up paying the volunteers as well, they got a 
salary to do it.  To run that war room cost millions of millions of rand and it’s dedicated 
20 
lines, dedicated data, it is live streaming it’s a mega operation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That kind of operation you did for the organisation, the ANC?   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you’d be doing it for the ANC at the request of somebody? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s right. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 86 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this one you’re talking about would have been at the request – 
it was a request, for example.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Nomvula Mokonyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you would not invoice the ANC or Ms Mokonyane? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, never, never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you talked about – did you mention something about another 
operation you did at Mangaung? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes there was Mangaung Operation there was some of the 
local election operations we did as well and we’d had the stats up on the board and it 
was run with military precision where we provided software and all that, so there were 
10 
quite a few, I can’t remember all of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you did these operations would Bosasa’s name be up 
there for everybody to see or not really?   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No but it would be subtle because you would have people 
eating in the diner so they would see the campus and they would see the smokes and 
mirrors and they would be impressed and they would say, gee Bosasa is actually a nice 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that people other than, for example Ms 
Mokonyane would know that Bosasa is involved because maybe Bosasa’s name was 
written somewhere where they could see or are you saying, not really. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were times when a lot of Ministers visited it and MEC’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then they would see the name? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes because it was all over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was all over? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 87 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it – would it be all over each time you did these kinds of 
operations for the ANC or only sometimes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No every time, whenever we did anything Chair, we had a 
branding division which is equivalent to a media house that you’d find in any large 
company.  We had, for instance, the ability to print banners that size behind you within 
30 minutes.  So if we were having a visit from yourself, we would print a banner like 
that, you’d have your name flashing on every single TV in the office park, you would be 
welcomed, security would have special welcoming badges made even your 
peppermints that you get on the table would have your logo on, the bottle of water 
would have the logos on, so everybody knew. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes everybody knew. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was a massive marketing campaign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you able to say certain leaders at Mangahung would have 
known? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSO:  Yes because the writing was there, Bosasa, Bosasa, Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja it wouldn’t have been at Mangahung it was at the call 
centre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the call centre? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so only those who visited the call centre would know that 
Bosasa was running the call centre? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi in paragraph 15.12 and in the 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 88 of 191 
 
paragraphs that follow up to paragraph 15.15 you deal with matters which you’ve 
touched on or dealt with up to now, is there anything – just if you would have a look at 
those paragraphs and if you want to add anything to your evidence please do. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you look at – I mean because of this protection we had there 
was never ever contracts cancelled, not one single contract was ever cancelled even 
though it was challenged it was never cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that’s something that I think a lot of people, including myself, 
might have been at some stage or another thinking about.  One of these I have thought 
about at some stage in the past was – that is even before I got involved in the 
commission was, there have been allegations of corruption involving Bosasa in the 
10 
media for so many years, how come Bosasa keeps on continuing with contracts and 
tenders with various government departments despite all these allegations in the media 
and we never hear that they’ve been resolved but they just continue to seem to get a lot 
of contracts and tenders.  So what people were supposed to attend to this when they 
see things in the media involving their departments and involving their government, 
involving maybe, parastatals I don’t know if there were any parastatals involved, were 
they looking away when they were supposed to say, I’ve seen something in the media 
involving my department, involving my government, saying, you know, there’s 
corruption involving this Bosasa company I want to know what’s happening, I want to 
have this dealt with.  Why was this not being done if it wasn’t being done, so I’m just 
20 
saying that even before I got involved in the commission I was concerned about – for 
years one has been hearing about, in the media, corruption, Bosasa, Correctional 
Services, government departments but there seems to be nothing being done by 
anybody.  Well you might not be able to say anything – you said something that 
prompted what I’ve just said. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 89 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think that what you’ve said is so true, that’s the power that 
the Watson’s have.  Nothing gets done, I mean there are people that have phoned me 
and said, you know I want to come talk to you because there’s a gentleman that’s been 
referred to me that worked there at corrections and he was very vocal about this, a Mr 
Jack Shilubane who was very vocal about Bosasa, why are we only using one 
company, it gets eradicated it gets taken out of the department.  Yes so there’s a lot of 
these things, I mean there are people that complained – the classic example was with 
the previous late commissioner Vernie Petersen, when he complained what happened 
because he was transferred and swapped with the Minister of Sport, the lady – I can’t 
remember her name now, what happened there, there was a move out.  Then she 
10 
cancelled the one contract, well not cancelled just didn’t renew it, she was moved out 
somebody else was put there, so it’s a constant battle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see, it may well be that a company such as Bosasa, to the 
extent that the evidence that you have given in this commission is found to be correct, 
to that extent it may well be that it’s approach was we must bribe certain people in 
order to get contracts and we must do certain other things for other people we’re not 
going  to necessarily bribe them but we’ll do certain things for other people so that they 
look away and don’t ask questions and I’m wondering whether, in  doing the kinds of 
things you have told me about in relation  to the governing party or for the governing 
party whether that they may have the effect that senior people within the governing 
20 
party who would have been aware of all the allegations of corruption in the media 
involving Bosasa, when they saw that Bosasa was involved in doing things for the 
organisation decided to look away and not to say, for example, I want to know whether 
these things I’m reading in the newspaper about Bosasa and Correctional Services are 
true.  I want an investigation to be done and I want it to be done quickly and I want 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 90 of 191 
 
results by – an outcome by a certain time and I was going to ask you later on but 
maybe I may as well mention now, I saw something in the media in terms of which there 
were allegations that certain donations has been done or made by Bosasa to the ANC 
and a certain huge amount was mentioned there and was said to have been admitted 
by a senior leader of the ANC to have been given to – that the donations given in cash 
or kind by Bosasa over a certain period would be at least a certain number of millions 
over a time and the question is, with all these allegations having being brought to the 
media – to the public’s attention by the media over the years about Bosasa did senior 
people within the governing party not see all of these things and decide that action 
must be taken to find the truth did they look away, did they look away because they 
10 
knew that Bosasa was giving donations to them, I don’t know, but those questions arise 
and maybe in due course you will tell us whether you know anything about donations 
to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and perhaps this is a good place to 
highlight the difference between a series of a regular procurement arrangements or 
incidents and what this commission is obliged to investigate and that is state capture 
because it seems to me that you’ve given evidence, Mr Agrizzi about more than just a 
series of a regular procurement acts or incidents.  You’ve spoken about a reasonably 
20 
well organised network of well placed, well connected and powerful people their loyalty 
secured through financial incentives/bribes and those – that network will then promote 
and protect, for example, private interests such as Bosasa allowing them in turn, 
through a regular procurement and practice to extract money from the state. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You’re a hundred percent right and what the honourable Chair 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 91 of 191 
 
has said is true.  There are large donations, I know of large donations given to the top 
six at one stage of 10/12 million rand cheques that were taken there and it always 
appears that it was just taken there because then there’s a meeting but you’re a 
hundred percent right Chair, once the others – the other people see that, that company 
is very proliferate, don’t touch it, don’t mess with it, it’s working don’t touch it because if 
you touch it you might lose your job, that’s ultimately what it comes down to and you 
might  lose your power base and that’s what it really was.  If people know that I’m 
speaking to the Pope on the phone on a regular basis the Cardinal who sees me 
gambling is not going to say anything to me he’s going to leave me alone, you know, 
that’s the – the only one whose really beyond reproach then, is the Pope and if you’re 
10 
bribing the Pope all the cardinals are not going to turn against the Pope or turn against 
you because you’ve got his cover, it’s a bad example we shouldn’t use it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Apart from that are you happy to move on 
then from paragraph 15.15? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you mentioned about – you mentioned a certain structure now, 
just now, if the position is that, indeed that is something that you have personal 
knowledge of make sure that they’ve got all the information. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair for me to get the facts they need to get all the records, 
once you’ve got that I can put it all together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have said so before and I know the legal team is definitely very 
20 
prepared, if you know that there is certain information about which you want to make 
available to the commission which is important for the type of thing that the commission 
is investigating but you can’t get the documents, talk to the legal team, the 
investigators, they will do the best they can to get that because that’s part of their job.  
Those people who want to assist the commission must be assisted by the investigators 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 92 of 191 
 
and the legal team to get information because we are the ones who want that 
information. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I understand Chair and quite honestly they’ve been hard at 
work but I know they’re inundated and I just flood them sometimes with information that 
I shouldn’t, I mean, I sit and email information, maybe what I need to do is to sit and 
write a whole dossier, spend two months writing a dossier and actually saying where to 
go look and that type of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair, the next issue that was 
raised was the date of the interdict brought on behalf of Bosasa to interdict the SIU 
10 
investigation into Bosasa and its activities. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say that those papers were filed in the 
North Gauteng High Court and you give the case number and that was done on the 30 th 
of April 2009? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then if we may move to the next topic that 
arose in your evidence and you’ve dealt with it briefly now today and that is the series 
of events involving the Department of Social Services in the North West Province. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You name two people, Gasie and Chidi in your 
evidence formally and you’ve had an opportunity now to make further investigations 
and to allow yourself to give further evidence about the relationship between Bosasa 
and the North West Province.  You deal with that in paragraph 17, won’t you tell the 
Chair about that please?  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 93 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Chair I managed to get some information, I’ve met the 
ladies so I know what they look like so I did some searching and got in to some of my 
old emails in the archives which only became available since the liquidators took over 
and I’m sure you’ve heard of the big mess with the liquidation there and that, so a lot of 
the documents are still being destroyed and we – I’m still trying to get them recovered 
but I don’t have direct access at all.  So Chidi appears to be a Matshadisa Cordilia 
Magali a former head at the Department of the Social Development in the Northwest, 
both the individuals were government – or government officials in the Northwest in 
Mahikeng and it was Sivi Dlamini that actually introduced me to them and interesting 
then Sivi and – I didn’t see it until I’d uncovered all the old emails Sivi actually 
10 
approached me with her CV, she was leaving the Northwest department because there 
was a hotting up of the investigation against her and she decided to resign and she 
wanted another job and wanted me to – because she was an advocate to look at 
providing an opportunity, maybe with one of the companies that legally we were 
working with at that stage but the documentation is available on that – the actual CV, 
the transmission to myself and that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you meet with the two persons you have 
just mentioned? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the content of those meetings? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the content of the meetings was to provide the software, 
as I mentioned, to be able to raise funding which they told me was for election hearing 
purposes.  So that was the content of the meeting, the one meeting, the other one was 
discussing the fencing at one of the facilities and security systems at one of the 
facilities where, also it was used as a laundering type system. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 94 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This fictitious arrangement around software 
where you say items of no value were either in the possession of the Northwest 
Province or were transferred to the Northwest Province. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The arrangement, as I understand it, was that 
the Northwest Province would pay Bosasa 4.5 million rand for that “transaction”. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Bosasa would keep half – approximately half 
and the other half would go to the individuals concerned.  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay would you like me to explain how it would work? 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes please because what arises here is the 
intervention of Miotto Trading. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, alright, so what happens is that Chair you get awarded 
a contract for Northwest, for one of the youth centres, to manage a youth centre which 
encompasses detaining children that are awaiting trial, training them putting them 
through school curriculum and all that.  It’s always perceived as a social initiative you’re 
getting paid R450 per child, sometimes R700 per child per day.  So included in that cost 
you basically have to provide all the services.  Now to provide the services effectively 
you use a computer programme which admits children and keeps records of the 
children and that type of thing so it’s a bit of a have to have anyway so that’s included 
20 
in  your price per person per day but then you’d get a request from somebody who 
says, we need money for electioneering.  So what would happen then is Sivi Dlamini 
would raise and invoice for a computer programme that is not – that is paid for in – per 
DM cost but its raised separately to be able to say well now, if you want this computer 
programme, which we need in terms of education and tracking and all this type of thing 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 95 of 191 
 
you have to pay 4.5 million rand.  It’s a once-off cost so government isn’t burdened with 
a month-to-month cost.  It’s very simple because nobody can prove that this software 
was never delivered, the software is there already its working and if somebody say but 
the software was there well no that was demo software.  So what would happen is that 
software would be sold and it would be – an invoice raised, obviously these people 
would make sure that the invoice was paid and an amount, obviously now the company 
is getting 4.5 million rand for nothing, the invoice is raised and the cash is sent out, 
does that clarify it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I just want you please to deal, if you 
would, with paragraph 17.6 Miotto Training and Morocco consultants. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay so…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We heard evidence about that yesterday from 
Mr Venter. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay so when Peet Venter decided to approach us and say he 
wanted to come clean and that, one of the things that he raised was Miotto, I mean this 
happened way after I’d left and he then explained the situation to me on how Miotto 
worked with Morocco and gave me all the detail as well and then put it in his own 
statement but what happened there, for instance, was there was much more money 
needed so what they drew up – and it’s very clear how it was done, was another way to 
filter money is training.  So they wrote up invoices to value of, I think, 1.4 million rand, 
20 
wrote up those invoices, wrote up a contract which – Miotto has got two employees 
Peet Venter and his sister-in-law, for training of 1.4 million rand or 1.3 million rand, I 
can’t recall the exact amount, I don’t want to even actually start looking for it but then 
invoice it out, it gets paid and that’s how bribes were paid out.  Now that specific one 
was also to do with Smart City and a potential contract in the Northwest area but I think, 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 96 of 191 
 
if I can just add there that there was never any training, so it’s all fictitious stuff but that 
was how Syvion and Gavin Watson had decided to move the funding. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes as I understand your evidence it coincides 
with that of Mr Venter at least in the respect that Miotto Trading was used to make 
disguised payments or to make payments that could not be easily traced. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes and he showed me the – he actually gave me 
documentation and that’s why I included it in mine because it was – I tested the 
documentation, I tested the information and then submitted it on my affidavit as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 18, you deal with a question 
relating to Mr Mti and his son in a meeting that took place at Clearwater, please tell the 
10 
Chair what happened? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:    Chair what happened there was – I used to get pulled into 
the most weirdest of situations.  There was a child that was a bit wayward alright and it 
was a bone of contention and it was creating havoc for Mr Mti  I was asked to 
intervene, I was sitting in the meeting there, and funny enough, I think it was a time 
when my son had just done well and he had got student of – I don’t know what he had 
done but he had done exceptionally well at school – at university and he got some 
award, I don’t know what happened – the facts of it is that I was then told by Gavin, 
listen, you better sort out – I want this guy happy at all times, pull his son into your son, 
let them work together let’s see if we can, not rehabilitate, that would be wrong and I 
20 
don’t like to talk badly about these kids but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To inspire him or motivate him. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Inspire him yes to become motivated on how to run a business 
and that type of thing and so I agreed to have a lunch meeting and put my family in a 
precarious position because my son wasn’t happy, he said, you know I don’t like this, 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 97 of 191 
 
he was a very active student at Wits and he knows people there – he worked with those 
people and so he wasn’t happy at all but nothing ever came of it he just retracted, he 
didn’t even bother registering the company he wasn’t interested in really doing – but 
that just gives you an example of how – I personally was compromised to keep other 
people happy like the phone calls at 9 o’clock at night to have 10 000 or 5 000 meals 
ready the very next morning so that’s the extent that it went to.  I mean there was even 
a situation – and I allude to it in the next paragraph, where one morning I arrived at the 
gate and I said to Gavin, I said no man, who is this gentleman at the gate, a security 
guy, no he’s a security guard, I said no ways guys, that’s father like son and I went 
personally and I went and asked the question, what is your name and he gave me his 
10 
surname and I went back, I was very annoyed, I said guys, we’re in the middle of this 
news and that and you go and put the gentleman’s son, that looks identical to him, at 
the gate, how daft can you be, well the next day he wasn’t there but I’m saying that’s 
the kind of things that happened. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair maybe we could regain that one minute 
it’s one minute to one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, let’s do that, it’s fine.  You, Well we – we took, well you 
want to, you suggest that you don’t ask further questions because it’s lunch time? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well it is, yes, having said that Chair ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to look, well it is on my watch but your watch might be 
20 
ahead of mine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It’s exactly one o’clock Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well on mine too, it’s exactly one o’clock.  We will take the 
lunch adjournment and we will resume at two. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 98 of 191 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would give feedback on how the operational statuses are 
what is happening internationally and that.  I would also be interested in the 
development of the industry and seeing how we could utilise international benchmarks 
in South Africa and where they would work and where they would not work.  So on a 
various basis I would get ad-hoc emails from him and from other people but in terms of 
corrections and I would respond to that and return my comments accordingly.  But at 
that stage I was not aware and I am talking now 2004/2005/2006 and onwards I was 
not aware that there was arrangements being made in the background.  So I was aware 
there something fishy but I did not know what and it is because I purely did not deal 
10 
with him directly.  And I did not know about any payments or promises or any 
arrangements so to speak.  I was also with Danny Mansell and Gavin Watson when we 
were with Patrick.  And I am not the type of person that gets concerned if I am not at a 
meeting.  You know if Gavin has decided to have meetings with people well he has 
meetings.  I do not have to be there.  But what is interesting is that t was always on – 
only on invitation.  But when the initial connection was made with Patrick Gillingham in 
the various positions he held within Correctional Services I only met him on a few 
diverse occasions.  It was only at a later stage that I personally had dealings with 
Patrick Gillingham and that I realised then the full extent of what had happened from 
day 1.  So it was a transition.  So what actually happened was when Danny Mansell left 
20 
to go to the United States I then was roped in and told you have to now deal with Danny 
Mansell.  I do not if you recall – with Patrick Gillingham.  I do not know if you recall the 
video report – the video that you saw where Gavin Watson says to Andries Van Tonder 
Brian Biebuyck will now deal with Patrick Gillingham I want you to drop off Patrick’s 
money but Brian Biebuyck will now handle him there is a handover between Brian and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 99 of 191 
 
Patrick and Angelo.  So that is how – you know you would work with somebody and 
then you would be told no you do not work with them anymore you work with somebody 
else now.  So that is how it actually happened.  And the full extent of the gratuities or 
corruption and laundering and that only really came to me when I read the full SIU 
report in 2009.  So I knew there was things happening.  I am not denying that.  But 
what I am saying is that the only the full extent of it came to me in 2009 and I 
confronted Gavin.  We were actually – if I look back on it I realise that they knew that 
the SIU report was coming out and Gavin then insisted that we go on a holiday 
overseas.  And it was while I was overseas that I heard that the report had come out 
and I managed to get a copy of the report emailed to me at the hotel in Paris.  We were 
10 
in Paris.  I was actually – I was on my way – I can remember it vividly I was actually on 
my way – I do not want to bore you with the details but I was on my way in a taxi with 
Gavin and with Andries to go and see the museum, the art museum and I turned back 
and I said forget it.  You know we had paid for everything and I said I want to see this 
report.  And when we got the report it was emailed to the hotel we were staying.  We I 
got the report I had it printed out in the business centre there, went upstairs and we 
started discussing and I was shocked because there were things there that I never 
knew.  But just to get back to the stories.  After I had started handling Gillingham 
directly and after I had started speaking to Mansell when he was decided to leave the 
country that is when more stuff started coming out to me.  And it was about in 2004 I 
20 
know that they went on a holiday together the two families.  The Mansell family and the 
Gillingham family.  Everybody, the kids, the spouses went on holiday.  Gavin wanted 
them to go on a holiday with a game reserve to settle transactions and to make sure 
that Patrick was a hundred percent on board.  So it was at that – apparently at that 
game reserve holiday where Gillingham and Mansell agreed on what would not be done 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 100 of 191 
 
and how it would be done.  Alright.  So what then happened and what I found out 
afterwards was that Mansell used a company that he had called Grand 4 and another 
company called L and J Civils.  Now L and J Civils I believe his son owned part of it as 
well.  They use that to start making payments for the building of the properties that they 
were using and that Gillingham would be getting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just for the record that is letter L and J? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  L and J ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not Allen J? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no not Allen J. Lima and Joseph.  So then what happened 
was when I was tasked by Gavin to start cleaning up all the invoices he mentioned to 
10 
me you have to clean up Grand 4 and L and J Civils.  So our task between Andries Van 
Tonder and myself and only the two of us were appointed to do it was to go into the 
records find every single invoice that referred to L and J and Grand 4 and those are the 
invoices we had pull, change and put back invoices in their place which had some other 
description on it.  You know I asked the question and it is vivid the day I was called into 
follow up the trail of L and J and Grand 4.  I ask the question, why did we have to do 
this?  Why did we put ourselves in this position as a company?  Why did we have to go 
through all this nonsense now and the answer that was given to me was quite simple.  
He turned and says don’t you worry about it if we did not do it somebody else would 
have had to do it.  Somebody else would have got the opportunity.  And it was a 
20 
concern to at that stage already.  But what was even more interesting what unfolded 
was whilst the houses were being built one of things that we picked up when we had to 
clean up was that Riaan Hoeksma used the architect called – let me just check here.  
They used the architect called HMZ Architects.  It was a lady by the name of Zietsman 
that drew up the plans for Mti’s house and drew up the plans for Gillingham’s house.  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 101 of 191 
 
But Bosasa paid the invoice.  So there was a slip-up there and that could never be 
cleaned up because it was on the system.  So that had to stay.  There was nothing we  
could do to clean it up and I think Riaan Hoeksma and Riekele came up with an excuse 
for it that they would then offer if they were questioned on it.  But I was only actually 
instructed to deal with Gillingham when Mansell decided to pack up with his family and 
Gavin agreed that he be – he be sent to go and stay in the USA.  And my involvement 
in that was to arrange the tickets for him, to pay for the tickets and also to make sure 
that his furniture or whatever got transferred over.  So at that stage I was then called 
into an introductory meeting with Gavin Watson and Patrick Gillingham and Patrick 
basically said you know he had a couple of requests.  He had a couple of issues that he 
10 
needed attending to.  Gavin also told me at that stage to get the cash from him every 
month for Patrick Gillingham and during that meeting Patrick mentioned that his house 
as I said he had some issues – there was a waterproofing issue, there was a problem 
with the pool, there was a problem with I think some of the fittings in the house and that 
and actually being very picky on it.  I mean you get a house for nothing you don’t 
complain about a pool that goes green too often and that type of thing.  So anyway my 
first job was I needed to sort it out immediately.  I was told, you got to get it done now.  
So I then had to arrange to get a quote from Patrick.  He would arrange the quotes and 
I would get the information and it was a quote to replace the pool with a Jacuzzi and 
have a decking put around it and I remember Patrick got me the quotes and Gillingham 
20 
sent them to me and I think he chose a plastic or wooden type decking and that 
basically was it.  But what is – I just want to divert a little bit because in my statement I 
see there is a paragraph there that refers to a meeting – a handover meeting between 
Brian Biebuyck, myself and Gillingham.  That did take place.  It took place in a 
restaurant come butchery very similar type setup to the butcher shop but in Midrand.  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 102 of 191 
 
There is an industrial butchery there.  I cannot recall the name I think – it is like a 
Seamans or something like that.  Where they have got a restaurant and a butcher shop 
and you choose your meat.  And we had a meeting there with Brian Biebuyck, the same 
meeting that was referred to in the video that should be taken – that meeting was held 
and I was happy because I had made it very clear I do not want to deal with the guys 
anymore I am not interested.  So that meeting took place.  Just to go back to the 
meeting with Gavin and Patrick where he mentioned the problems of the houses and 
that.  I remember phoning Riekele Construction on my way out there and speaking to 
Riaan Hoeksma and telling him what the problems were.  I did not have a good 
relationship with Riaan Hoeksma at all because I would always find fault with his 
10 
building work at Bosasa and I was not happy using sub-contractors.  So he was – he 
went out, he sorted out the problem and then a couple of weeks or days later Patrick 
had given us the invoices for the pool repair to change it to a Jacuzzi it was about 
R100 000,00 and I then took the cash and gave that to Patrick Gillingham.  Alright.  So I 
was also told exactly what the package of cash was.  So in the meeting between 
myself, Gillingham and Gavin we were told – I was told at least by them that he was 
getting R47 500,00 per month in cash and that it had to be – get to him before the 25th 
of every month.  So by the 25th of the month he had to be paid.  Alright so that was an 
instruction that I received.  I was also informed that he is entitled to an international 
holiday once per annum.  That was reiterated by Danny Mansell that we would pay for 
20 
his holiday as well.  And if there was any needs that he required any special 
requirements I must assist by coming to Gavin with it and I would have to motivate it to 
Gavin.  You know when Danny Mansell left for Texas in the US basically I would get 
calls just out of the blue from Patrick.  I tried to only meet once a month and I think my 
credit card slips will show it where I would have a once a month meeting with him and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 103 of 191 
 
normally the meetings would take place either at Midstream Estates where he stayed.  
There was a coffee shop on the property there or it would take place – he liked to go to 
the Fishmonger at Centurion opposite Rhapsodies on John Vorster Drive.  So those are 
where the meetings would take place.  I would try and hurry them up and just get out of 
there.  I was not a hundred percent happy with sitting with them in those meetings.  I 
had work to do.  I was focussed on working and to take out two/three hours to go and 
entertain somebody is just – it is not my liking.  So… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was the content of those meetings? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The content of those meetings was … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Discussing operational issues that might have come up in 
Correctional Services but not operational in the sense of how is Bosasa doing?  The 
discussions would be oh you must be careful there is a guy by the name of – I am just 
using a name now Mr X who is creating a problem, we need to deal with him and how 
are we going to manipulate the situation to deal him.  There was one situation where he 
said look I want a private eye – there is meeting that is being held in Drakensberg and I 
want a private eye to see what is happening at that meeting.  And I would then – where 
do I get a private eye?  I would have to make phone calls and eventually find somebody 
20 
and send them out there and do that.  But those were the contents of the meeting was 
to basically solidify Bosasa’s presence at Correctional Services.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got any recollection of around about which year it was 
when there was this meeting of a handover to you of the responsibility to deal with Mr 
Patrick Gillingham? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 104 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Chair I did not hear the first part of your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Do you have any recollection of when it was around which year 
it was when this handover meeting took place where you were going to start dealing 
with Mr Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was 2008.2009 I think I cannot remember exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no that is good enough.  Around about those years? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I cannot remember exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less.  Ja okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right let us just pause there a moment if we 
may because there may be some difficulty in following the time line involved in the 
10 
events to which you refer.  You speak about the incident on the video that we played. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In Gavin Watson’s vault. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where a conversation took place as to how 
Patrick Gillingham’s gratuity or money was to be dealt with? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There an amount of R110 000,00 was 
mentioned. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R110,000,00. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  R110 000,00. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then later you have talked about an 
amount of R47 500,00 per month. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 105 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please put those in sequence and explain? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I asked the question right in the beginning how do we get 
to R47 500,00 and the answer was given to me that that is the same amount that he 
gets out on his salary slip.  So I presume I cannot – well let me not presume at all.  So 
the R47 500,00 was calculated because he was earning R47 500,00 from the 
department and then he would get R47 500,00 from Bosasa.  What happened was 
when he was suspended and he eventually resigned that was then doubled up because 
his earnings the argument was and this is from Gavin’s side and Patrick’s side the 
argument was well his actual take home was R47 500,00 times 2 which gives you 
what?  R100 000,00 odd.  Plus there was a R2 000,00 for cell phone. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    R95 000,00. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R105? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  95. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  95. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  47 plus 47. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry medical aid.  So there was also contributions of medical 
aid and that type of thing.  So the amount was agreed on R110 000,00.  And that 
amount was like that for about four years. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright so the amount of R110 000,00 although 
it is dealt with earlier in your affidavit. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was the later amount paid. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct after it had been… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The initial amount paid which also involved you 
is R47 500,00 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 106 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Let me just ask too.  You said in your 
evidence and we have discussed this that you only became and you used the word fully 
aware  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of the full extent of the wrongdoing in or 
around 2009? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The extent of your knowledge before then must 
have been the drafting of specifications for Correctional Services Contracts? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Even prior to the issue of the tender 
documents? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you must have known at that stage to put it 
is a phrase, something was up? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct I did. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You must also have known that cash was going 
out before 2009? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I knew there was cash going out otherwise why would they 
20 
have done it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Otherwise why would they have done it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Exactly so I am just querying the extent of your 
knowledge before 2009. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 107 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay so let me put it in perspective.  So normally people just 
get cash in the company.  And I thought well I did not know how much cash was going 
out but I thought they were friends and they had come a long way and sometimes there 
was just a good relationship but I knew that Gavin would have made sure that he 
entrapped both Mti and Gillingham with cash.  I knew that.  Would have – it was going 
to happen. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before 2009? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes that is even – even 2008 around there I knew that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The problem came in is when I found out about the houses.  
10 
Because suddenly I realised that and I carry on and I explain it in my affidavit in depth 
that I was excluded from certain things and I would query certain things and I was told, 
don’t you worry about it.  Things like that and we would carry on in our – in my affidavit 
where I actually explain the fact that certain people at the office were involved in 
building houses.  There was transactions that went through.  Mark Taverner and his 
family’s business to buy furniture and that, that I did not know about.  That only came 
out later and actually the SIU report was very informative.  I was actually shocked.  I 
mean I never knew about buying matric farewell dresses or a holiday paid for or a 
special kitchen bought.  Those only came out afterwards. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that is when I started identifying that there is a major 
problem here. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in short even before 2008/2009 you would 
have been aware of a degree of corruption? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I was.  And I would like to – I would like to perhaps 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 108 of 191 
 
elaborate on that when I – when we get to it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright let us then go to paragraph 19.12 but 
you have summarised at least two to three pages in fact more of your evidence up to 
paragraph 19.12.  So if you want to have a look over that – those pages to see if there 
is anything you might have left out or wish to deal with more expressly please do not let 
me rush you on to paragraph 19.12? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  I think what is critical and what is very important here is 
the 200 phone call that I got from Patrick Gillingham.  So initially Gavin Watson… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is in paragraph 19.12? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  I think that is critical because at that stage I had just 
10 
started off and it was just the beginning of things.  Danny Mansell was still there by the 
way and what actually happened was I got this call that the SIU had raided him.  And 
more importantly what he told me is that they had done such a good job of the raid they 
found cash in the safe, they found his firearm, they took his firearm away but they had 
found a Consillium business card.  And I was astounded because why on earth would 
there be a Consillium business card with his name on it?  It did not make sense to me.  
But nonetheless I had to rush through to go and see Gillingham and Gavin’s first 
instruction to me was go and – go through the house yourself and go make sure there 
is nothing else left.  But what was interesting was that when they raided him they did 
not check the garage and there were boxes and I think they still there today or they 
20 
won’t be by close of business today but there were boxes in the garage which had files 
and files of important stuff.  So they raided everything and then Gavin wanted me to go 
but I did not have the heart to go to a house and go through someone’s house it is just 
not how I was raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean they raided but did not raid the garage? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 109 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja they did not raid the garage.  No the boxes were still there.  
But the interesting thing was on the Consillium business card that told me something 
was much deeper and there was other issues as well.  Because he had apparently 
when I had confronted Doctor Smith because he had printed the business card Doctor 
Smith said to me that Gavin had told him that he had to get Patrick to accompany him 
to go and see a manufacturer or supplier of goods and this supplier of goods he wanted 
to make the guy realise that Patrick in the position that he was as the CFO also has an 
interest in this business.  And the whole idea was to strong-arm the owner of the 
business to say, listen we can give you business at Correctional Services but you need 
to understand that we want 26% of your company.  And exactly the same tactic was 
10 
done to get the – acquire the shares in Better Fence as well to get the 26%.  So let me 
just go back to that.  I did not want to go and – to go through his house so I went down 
to a restaurant that was close by Midstream Estate and he said he had been now 
suspended from his position by the then Commissioner of Correctional Services Vernie 
Petersen.  Now the following morning at about 6:30 Gavin Watson came to my office.  I 
was always there the first in and the last out so I was there at about five o’clock.  He 
arrived at 6:30 and he said to me, come you got to come with me now we have got to 
Mti.  So we got in the car and we went off to go and see Mti at his house in Midstream 
Estates.  And he then went from there we went – we had to go and see Patrick because 
he wanted to make sure that everybody was calm and no mistakes were being made.  
20 
So we then saw Patrick at the Protea Midrand which is close to Midstream Estates and 
close to the place where Richmond Mti has his house.  It slipped my mind now.  But 
basically we chatted in the parking lot and Gavin told Patrick not to be concerned.  
Patrick’s biggest concern at that stage was his pension fund.  He was not worried about 
losing his job because he knew he was getting R110 000,00 from Bosasa coming up.  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 110 of 191 
 
So he was not concerned about that.  His biggest concern was the pension fund he had 
accumulated over the years.  But Gavin said to Patrick you do not need to worry even 
Bosasa has to stand in and cover the pension fund we will do it.  As a matter of fact in 
the car on the way back we had a discussion about it and Gavin said I must just find out 
how much it is and we just need to make a contingency available for the pension fund.  
Gavin also said to Patrick not to worry his legal fees would be paid for by the company 
and Gavin instructed me to then utilise an arms-length company that he had given us to 
attend to it.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It may seem very obviously but for the record 
why would Watson ask you to create an arms-length company to pay Gillingham’s legal 
10 
fees? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gavin believed that if there was always an arms-length 
company it would not be traced back to him.  So he would rather have it – distance.  
And we have seen it in the revelations that there is always a Miotto or always a 
Syncroprop or always a Aluwise or whatever company there is to be able to utilise it.  
And that is why it was done.  So the carrot for Gavin was to use the arms-length 
company it will never come back to me.  Because he does not have to sign anything off.  
So there was a conference on the go at the Protea Midrand it gets often used by 
government departments.  So we did not even go in and normally we would go in and 
have a coffee or something to eat.  That specific day we did not we sat in the car and 
20 
Patrick sat in the back of Gavin’s car and spoke to him there.  But then yes I mentioned 
to you when we were coming back Gavin said to me, what kind of pension is it and how 
much is it?  So I had to find out and he said that we had to make a contingency for that. 
But he said – he said you know they have been loyal to the group and I think there was 
– there must have been some agreement and he wanted Patrick comfortable and Mti 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 111 of 191 
 
comfortable that he said to them, look we will honour looking after you and that for the 
rest of your lives.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did he mention in that conversation that is 
Watson how Gillingham and Mti had assisted Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: Yes.  What he said was he said, all the tenders – I mean all the 
business at Correctional Services came through Mti and Gillingham.  And even Mti was 
the commissioner and he had no right to sign off a contract Chair in today’s times 
basically an instruction gets given and it happens.  You know people do not go against 
their bosses anymore.  Jobs are too scarce.  So Mti just made sure he put the right 
people in place, signed off the applications and that is how it happened. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were arrangements then made to assist 
Gillingham in relation to his suspension and its outcome? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  So what happened was Chair that – about two days later 
Gavin had been in consultation with Sesinyi Seopela and Sesinyi then told me I must 
meet him at a firm, they were in what is that street opposite the court in Johannesburg?  
There is a street there where [indistinct] chambers is and all that.  One of those 
buildings if I remember correctly it was on top of a bank on the right hand side.  And I 
had to meet – really a dingy offices a company called can I mention the name I have 
got it in my statement? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  BDK attorneys alright and I had to – and Sesinyi was 
introducing me to a gentleman by the name of Ian Small Smith.  Now before we went 
into the meeting I said you know I am very concerned because this does not look like 
proper offices, you know are these real attorneys?  And Sesinyi mentioned another 
gentleman in government that this guy had helped and he was very successful.  I do 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 112 of 191 
 
not want to mention the gentleman’s name but very successful they made a mistake 
with the search warrant.  They brought all the documents and they still joked about it in 
the meeting that they had then taken the documents and burnt them before the 
Scorpions could get another search warrant or something like that.  So this guy was 
highly rated.  Big rugby fanatic because we spoke about rugby and there was rugby 
paraphernalia all over the place.  So I then sat in the meeting and he wanted to know 
what happened and Patrick explained everything to him.  He said no he will handle it 
and once more he would then send his invoices through to either Andries Van Tonder or 
myself and we would arrange to pay it.  And it was paid through … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just pause there if you will.  This particular 
10 
attorney and this firm 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were simply asked to assist Gillingham in a 
potential legal suit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thanks which lawyers normally do? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Nothing untoward about it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No not at all. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what you have just told the Chair about 
20 
what you were told. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is entirely hearsay.  You have no evidence to 
back that up I presume. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In terms of the? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 113 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of the Scorpions and the document. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh no.  Ja, this was told to me; this was used to motivate to 
me why this was such a good. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Attorney.  That is why. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It just implicates certain people and 
[intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [Intervenes] on the basis of unsubstantiated 
hearsay.

MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My apologies. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, go on please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  So a company, an arm’s length company was used 
which actually belonged to Mansell and Gillingham, Mansell and Watson before called 
Synchro Prop number 8.  It sounded like a very nice thing that Gavin did for us.  He 
gave us a company with a property at Ruimsig Golf Club.  So we thought this was how 
nice of the man.  Well Chair it is a hole in the ground and it is really, I mean, it is a 
disaster.  There is no value in it whatsoever.  It cannot be sold. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well let us not digress at the moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the hole in the ground. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But Synchro Prop. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was again an intermediary company? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 114 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To, what was the purpose hereto of using an 
intermediary company to affect payments for the legal fees of Gillingham? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is one of them and there were other payments that had to 
go through it as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and is that the same arm’s length 
company you referred to earlier? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  The reason why I mentioned the property is purely 
because we thought it was a good, you know, was a nice gesture. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Just before you go on then is that, does 
10 
that complete that section of your evidence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it does. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You mentioned Consilium. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that Consilium Business Consultants (Pty) 
Ltd? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The same company, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was that the company that had formally been 
owned by Dr Jurgen Smith? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But transferred into the Bosasa stable at some 
stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was never transferred into the Bosasa stable.  Consilium 
was owned and I stand to correction, but was owned by Dr Jurgen Smith and his one 
son who owned I think 10 percent of that company.  When Dr Smith fell ill about three 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 115 of 191 
 
months before he passed on the company was transferred to Peet Venter’s sister called 
Ms Longworth.  That company was owned by Peet Venter and only by Peet Venter and 
the shareholders there were Booi and Nklele.  Those were the shareholders with 
Peet Venter for the, to show the compliance, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  When I say transferred into the Bosasa 
stable perhaps I used the term to lightly.  It was utilised by Bosasa in its business 
activities? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the only client it had. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Okay.  Now in that sense we have heard 
evidence that payments were made by Consilium Business Consultants (Pty) Ltd to 
10 
members of the Watson family. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Venter told us this.  Mr Venter did not say 
so with certainty, but said I was told that for all the members of the Watson family who 
received money from Consilium. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Services were rendered and proper contracts 
of employment were in place.  Do you have any comment on that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is not true. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the correct position as far as you are 
20 
aware? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I can tell you exactly what Consilium was, because Dr Smith 
used to bring me the invoice every month and the attached payroll to sign off and I was 
signed to secrecy, but I mean the fact is that there were kids paid on that payroll.  There 
were family members, his wife.  Lindi Gouws was on that payroll.  I was on that payroll. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 116 of 191 
 
You see the big thing about Consilium was it was developed to cover up what people 
were actually earning because the law had changed somewhat in that in your financial 
statements you have to reflect what people earn what the highest earners are and that 
type of thing.  So Gavin did not want the Black Directors to know exactly what we were 
earning either.  So that is why half our salaries were paid on Consilium and half was 
paid on Bosasa, but the family was on there.  People, Sesinyi Seopela was on there.  
There were various people.  It is like a secret payroll and if I recall correctly there is 
Consilium 1 and Consilium 2.  So as soon as Consilium reached the threshold there 
was a second Consilium opened up on the payroll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Consilium 1 and Consilium 2 separate legal entities? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, apparently they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the directorships and the shareholders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Were the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same people? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So are you able to say in order to answer the 
narrow question whether those persons who received monies purportedly for services 
rendered or as employees from Consilium actually did the work for Consilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there was no work done.  Absolutely nothing. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Mr Venter also said that Consilium 
would raise three invoices for Bosasa Operations, African Global Operations, Sondolo 
Bosasa Youth Development Centres on a monthly basis in order to recover the fees 
and salaries paid by Consilium.  Do you know anything about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Dr Smith had a; we had to allocate charges to the various 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 117 of 191 
 
companies and that was split up amongst the companies.  So it was not all lumped into 
one company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I just go back to there having been no work done by people who 
were paid by Consilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the position throughout the time that you were there and 
Consilium was there or only from a certain time to a certain time namely that people 
were being paid but were not doing any work for Consilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I am talking about family members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only family members? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Family, friends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Political alliances that type of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those people did not provide any services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Family members? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but there were other people who were not family members 
20 
or were there other people who were not family members who were being paid but were 
doing some work for Consilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there were other people who were not family members 
who also did not provide a service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 118 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And got paid.  Then there were people like myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Andries van Tonder was one of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was Vincent Callegaro I think was on Consilium.  I think 
Ken J Larkin was on Consilium.  I cannot remember all the names off the top of my 
head, but it was some people who did do some work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some work, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  For Consilium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now Mr Venter I think it was testified that Consilium was or is a 
10 
labour broker, if I remember correctly.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  It was never registered as a labour broker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did it perform [intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The intention was to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The intention of Consilium, sorry, the intention of Consilium 
was to show that it is a separate company providing a service to Bosasa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is basically it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now labour brokers you would know gets people who need work who 
20 
need employment and then provides those people to an employer who needs workers 
and then for doing that the labour broker will get some money and so when the workers 
provided by the labour broker to. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To an employer gets paid there is a certain amount that would have 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 119 of 191 
 
been as I understand the position used to pay the labour broker some commission or 
something.  That is not what was happening with Consilium? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Consilium never made a profit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not while Dr Smith was, I do not about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Venter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But Consilium never made a profit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And my reason for my answer to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Is that it was not a labour broker was because it did not 
comply with the certain regulations that are set out for labour brokers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I think if the investigations team can look it at they will see 
there are regulations that govern labour broking companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  All Consilium was, was a desk and a computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As a matter of fact the lady running the Salary Department in 
Bosasa spent one or two days a week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Working at the desk there and just printing out salary slips. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 120 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have dealt with some of the information 
contained in the following paragraph 20.  In other words payments made to 
Mr Gillingham.  You have spoken in paragraph 20.2 of the R47 500 per month for the 
period during which Gillingham was employed by Correctional Services? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you say in paragraph 20.3 that after 
Gillingham’s suspension and ultimate resignation he received R110 000 per month? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have explained the makeup of that in 
paragraph 20.3? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened in 2015? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In 2015 there were talks again about the SIU Report and all 
that and Gillingham actually was very annoyed and he felt that he had been short 
changed and he felt that it was not fair and that he also had to show some income 
coming in as if he had a job and he was very annoyed about this whole process.  So in 
2015 I said well why do we not put him on Consilium, because nobody looks at 
Consilium anyway and then he can show employment and he gets UIF payments done 
and all that type of thing.  So I said well if he is complaining put him on Consilium and 
the next morning Gavin came to me and spoke to me and he said to me that no he had 
20 
met with Dr Smith and they do not want to put him onto Consilium, but rather what I 
should do is rather use an arm’s length which is BEE Foods and, because BEE Foods 
was owned by his brother-in-law and his sister, Mark Taverner.  That what should 
happen is he should be employed in BEE Foods.  Now I do not have to go and speak to 
Mark Taverner which I did and Gavin also spoke to Mark Taverner and said listen what 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 121 of 191 
 
we will do, because what happened Chair if I can just, I need to explain this because it 
is difficult if I do not explain it.  So you had BEE Foods.  BEE Foods and other suppliers 
would supply Bosasa normally, but then we had Bosasa Supply Chain Management 
which is the whole SeaArk tax thing afterwards.  So what had to happen was that a 
certain premium of 25 percent had to be charged to, charged on top of the invoice 
price.  There is two reasons for it.  The one reason was because it is easier to go for 
increases from the client.  So you could show in 2014 that you were paying R13.50 for 
potatoes and now because you added the 25 percent to the R13.50 or R14.50 as a 
rebate the invoice price went up to R18.00.  Now the difference between the R18.00 
and the R14.00 would go to Bosasa Supply Chain Management.  So with BEE Foods 
10 
the same system was utilised.  However instead of them having to pay the 25 percent 
rebate to BCM the 25 percent rebate would be reduced to say 20 percent to be able to 
cover the salary and the vehicle of Patrick Gillingham.  So you would not be able to pick 
it up if you did not know where to look. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was Mr Gillingham actually employed by BEE 
Foods? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he did not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did he work for BEE Foods? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, he never worked for them.  He just received a salary and 
a vehicle. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and the amount was recovered. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By this rebate structure you spoke about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, through the rebate structure. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  How then? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 122 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, if you go into the history of the rebate structures in all 
the companies you will pick up immediately, it sticks out like a sore thumb that all the 
other companies are paying 20/25 percent and BEE foods is paying much less. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you recall when the arrangement to pay 
Gillingham supposedly on an employment basis by BEE Foods was made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Dates and names are bad with me, but I think it was about 
2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But you will be able to pick it up from the UIF payments. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Whilst we are on this topic we heard 
10 
evidence yesterday or the day before concerning SeaArk. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we heard how the arrangements involving 
SeaArk were developed and took place. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words SeaArk was interposed as a 
supply chain management company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To acquire goods for the Bosasa companies. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It made a mark-up. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it made a profit. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well because  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that profit was offset said Mr Venter and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 123 of 191 
 
you yourself said so in your earlier evidence was offset against the assessed tax loss? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Venter said however or certainly strongly 
suggested that this was an entirely legitimate arrangement that involved no prejudice to 
the South African Revenue Services and he said that any falsification of any invoices 
would have been picked up by the auditing firm with which he was involved. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And therefore that reason there was no 
defrauding of SARS.  What would you say to that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is not correct and I tell you why.  Let me explain what 
10 
actually happened and I am not an accountant Chair but I can give you an overview of 
what happened and I do not even need to look at my notes.  It is imbedded in my mind.  
The fact of the matter is that SeaArk ran a loss of close on about R310 million.  It was a 
stupid operation to start off with, okay.  Then what happened was eventually myself and 
Andries van Tonder actually lied to Gavin Watson.  We said that, because we were 
paying out to America to some company in America that Gavin owned shares in, we 
were paying over a million Rand a month.  The company was going through a rough 
time.  So what happened was we said to him no the Reserve Bank is closed.  They will 
not allow us to transfer any more money, because we were battling to pay salaries and 
wages.  I had to bond up my house.  Andries had to bond up his house to pay wages, 
20 
but we were transferring a million Rand a month overseas to America.  So we were, we 
lied there and we said it cannot happen anymore. So that led to the closure of SeaArk.  
Eventually Gavin Watson saw the light.  He realised this thing is not going to work.  We 
are not going to get the money from the DBSA and the DTI and he agreed to close it 
up, but the problem is we had bought a lot of equipment that was specially designed by 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 124 of 191 
 
a company called Shrimp Co in the US and was imported and cost us in the region of 
about I think the equivalent of nearly R20 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Will you not spell that name for the record 
please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Shrimp Co, S-H-R-I-M-P-C-O. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I need to check on that name, because I remember there is a 
couple of names that, but this company supplied the equipment that specialises in 
de-veining, weighing and deheading and cleaning shrimp and it is very simple 
equipment, but it is very important equipment if you are going full out with a shrimp 
10 
manufacturing plant, but to give you an indication the equipment is little trays like roller 
trays.  I can show you photos of it eventually.  I can bring them and they have got 
scales and all little things and ice machines and that type of thing.  So what happened 
was Peet Venter was the one who suggested no but wait if you change the name of the 
company and the focus of the guts of the company and you say no, no but you are 
using this stuff the equipment and what happened was then a series, this is when 
SeaArk closed, a series of fictitious invoices were created and these pieces of 
equipment were shipped out to all the catering operations under the guise that we are 
continuing with this business but we are changing the very nature of the business.  As I 
said I am not an auditor.  So I cannot give you the, I cannot give you the guts of the 
20 
SARS Act and all that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just pause for a moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The leasing of the equipment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 125 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the various Bosasa operations. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have described this equipment as shrimp 
beheading. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  De. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Trays and things like that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And icing. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Specialist equipment to deal with little shrimps. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Glass freeze equipment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did that have any use in the Prison Catering 
Department? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well to give you an idea that equipment was never ever used.  
That equipment stood in a shed in Port Elizabeth and I had to truck it up and we used, 
Frans Vorster will tell you exactly how we got it up, but we got it all back to a place 
called Luipaardsvlei and I put it under, it was wrapped.  It was still wrapped in its 
containers.  I put it at Luipaardsvlei and then what we did was because SARS was 
doing an audit we packed it all out and said to them no, it is part of the meat processing 
plant. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So fundamentally the continuation of the 
business as an equipment leasing company was a fraud? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was a fraud. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Mr Venter knew that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He knew it well, because they drew up in one of the affidavits 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 126 of 191 
 
we have got a piece of paper.  Chair I am not joking.  It must be the size of that behind 
you which was drawn up by Phillip, Peet Venter’s associate to show were we need to 
allocate the equipment and how much we have to charge for that equipment.  So there 
was a big brown piece of paper.  I have got a picture of it on my phone with names of 
the various units.  Those units never received the goods.  So then what happened was 
Frans Vorster was tasked to write out delivery notes and invoices or delivery notes for 
each piece of equipment to each operation at Correctional Services.  That equipment 
then he had to give an affidavit which he did and interestingly enough we used the only 
Commissioner of Oaths in the company to commission it, but that equipment never ever 
left Luipaardsvlei.  That equipment was eventually sold for R3 million as scrap metal.  
10 
The gentleman who sold it and handled the whole transaction was a guy that I put in 
charge, he was a family member that I employed called Peter Reiger.  His two jobs was 
purchasing of equipment and disposal of non-utilised assets.  So all those assets were 
sold everything.  The glass [indistinct], everything was sold for R3 million.  I think it 
might have been R2.8 million and why I remembers that is because I still fought with 
them because I wanted prepayment of the goods.  There must be an advert somewhere 
from an auction as well where we put it out on auction and nobody pitched up. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Is there anything else about the 
operation at SeaArk that you may be able to assist the Chair with? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There is one anecdote with SeaArk with computers and that 
20 
that were buried at SeaArk.  I do not know if I should mention it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think you do mention that in your statement. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh, I do.  Not that is fine.  I can deal. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You may as well deal with it now. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well you know we have tendered our assistance Chair to 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 127 of 191 
 
assist and one of the issues was the burying of Grand Four Computers and the burying 
of documentation.  Now there were two incidents.  The one incident was at 
Luipaardsvlei which I was involved in.  The other one was taking all the computers 
which contained the information and hard drives of Grande Four and Allan J Civils. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on just please remind the 
Chair what documentation this was and why it was important to destroy it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  The Grande Four documentation shows, it reflects all 
the purchases for all the houses for Mti and Gillingham and Allan J Civils also reflects 
the same.  So that had to be destroyed.  Then Gavin sent it all down to Port Elizabeth 
and he said it must be buried at SeaArk.  So they buried it at SeaArk. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now SeaArk is. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is on the coast. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A factory on the coast? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On the beach? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and they buried it at SeaArk.  They put it in plastic 
bags and dug a big hole.  I recall seeing where the hole was.  I was told where the hole 
was and when I flew in I saw they had just dug up the hole and they buried the 
computers there, but then subsequently about three week ago, four weeks ago I get a 
call from the news reporter in Port Elizabeth asking me do I know why they are digging 
20 
up at SeaArk.  Apparently somebody had gone there and started digging up and they 
were digging holes.  She said where you could bury whales in.  They were so big, but 
they had not found anything, but if somebody had spoken to us we would have told 
them those computers were picked up a long time ago.  Gavin Watson insisted that 
they get picked up and that they get burnt and they were never burnt.  They were kept 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 128 of 191 
 
in the garage of Arthur Kotzen’s son-in-law and they probably still there till tonight 
probably or after they have seen this, but if somebody had just asked us we could have 
helped and assisted in telling them exactly where they are.  They would not have had to 
dig up the whole coastline of Coega. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just to restore confidence in our law 
enforcement agencies could you tell the Chair who was doing the digging? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  I will not.  I will not.  I am already in trouble. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was, I can say from my own knowledge and 
10 
the legal team it was an official excavation Chair.  From paragraph 20.6 onwards you 
deal with more of the benefits received directly or indirectly by Patrick Gillingham some 
of which you have already dealt with.  Do you want to deal with those please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was one time there was a divorce on the table.  I 
had to get involved.  An attorney, a group of attorneys were used, the invoice was sent 
to ourselves to make payment for the divorce, but more importantly a settlement had to 
be reached.  Now the one thing that Gavin said to me, he said you know the last thing 
there is no greater wrath than a woman scorned.  So make sure that the wife is taken 
care of and the agreement was that there would be a R2.2 million settlement from 
money we kept in the trust account with the attorneys that would go to the wife and that 
20 
had to be arranged. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who paid for that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  There has been evidence about the 
vehicle purchased for Patrick Gillingham’s. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 129 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Child.  We have that evidence on record.  Is 
there anything you wish to add to that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was just told to go with to make sure it gets done.  I must say 
whenever Gavin had committed to do something for someone he wanted it done 
immediately.  So irrespective if you are on holiday, I think that one actually happened 
just before Christmas.  It was like the 21st or the 22nd of the month.  I had to leave 
everything.  I had to meet up with Andries, make sure he goes to the Glen.  Make sure 
he orders the car, make sure everything is paid, make sure everything gets done 
properly because he was an important client. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was he quite good in delivering? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he quite delivering whenever he had promised? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gavin? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you were doing something for him yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you were doing something for him Chair he would go out of, 
make everything happen to get it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you also refer in paragraph 20.9. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And 20.10 of assistance given to Gillingham’s 
son? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja.  I had to get a top labour lawyer.  We have a common 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 130 of 191 
 
acquaintance with a gentleman.  I do not want to really mention his name, but he had to 
interact and get involved with the, with the whole issue and there was a payment that 
had to be made of R700 000 and that was made from the attorneys trust account. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and then finally by way of summary you 
say in paragraph 20.11 who made decisions in relation to the assistance to Gillingham 
and Mti.  What was the position? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The company was owned and run by one person only and he 
would make the ultimate decision. As much as people would like to think that I could 
make decisions, the decisions were limited and you could only make a decision if you 
had his backing and he agreed to it.  Otherwise you would be in big trouble.  I mean 
10 
you would turn around and say I didn’t know about it, and often he would do that, he 
said no I did not know about it and then you would remind him and sketch the picture 
and then he says oh yes now I remember, but everything had to be approved by Gavin 
Watson. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then finally you were asked when last you 
gave evidence to decode the list of payments recorded in your black books. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And to give some clarity in that regard. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   We have Annexure HH which is at page 86 of 
20 
your affidavit. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should just take the Chair through 
the information which is important, because it relates to contemporaneous notes that 
you made at the time. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 131 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But it’s – your translation from code to names 
...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Very difficult. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So if we could start please at page 86 and just 
explain to the Chair what you did to establish this spreadsheet and what this 
spreadsheet contains, both from your black book and what you have translated from 
your black book for the purposes of creating this spreadsheet please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what I’ve relied upon here Chair is my memory number 
one, and number two, the amounts that I know people were getting and also my the 
10 
sequence in which I would write it because those were all, these were standard type 
payments every month, so remember the shorthand I used was off the top of my head 
so if I saw – if I had to give a package to Paul Pretorius, Advocate Paul Pretorius it 
would be APP because that’s the first thing, but it could also change, it could be PAP, 
you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But basically it was your own creation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair correct, because if it’s your own creation then nobody 
can fault you on it you know, but if you use like Volkswagen as a word and then use 
those as the codes as we did in the old days then people can decipher it, so remember 
that I knew the amounts that were going out there so I knew exactly what had to be 
20 
paid out.  JCB1110CAA means it’s for Patrick Gillingham, it’s I would drop it off, CAA 
would mean that I’m taking the money because it meant AA Angelo Agrizzi, PLC would 
be Papile Chabane, he would collect it, STL would be Syvion Dlamini alright and then I 
knew it was for the Northwest because I put an N at the back of CC, if I looked at JGV it 
would Joe Gumede alright and I knew that that R30 000 was for a lady at ACSA, then 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 132 of 191 
 
you will see there I used the same codes because all 30 000, it was every month R120 
000 or sorry R90 000 that went with Joe Gumede to pay off people at ACSA so I kept 
them together, so I didn’t differentiate on the bags either, but then for instance KLF was 
Kloof alright and Ismail Tikane would come and fetch it from me.  LIB was Libanons 
Union, Ismail would deal with it, he would fetch it, TTV50CCV that was specifically 
Thandi Makoko and it was for Limpopo for the whatever MEC that she told she was 
giving it to.  If you look at TMK was also Thandi Makoko and that was YDL was used 
Development Centres.  NMR was Nomvule Mokanyane and Gavin Watson would 
collect that, so KZN was Nele and Ismail Tikane would collect that, so I would just make 
up these codes as I went along, but I knew exact who it was and I knew who picked it 
10 
up so ELF was Elfred Mayakela, Ismail Tikane would his up.  Then again on the 
following one ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry before you go on over the page the 
period of time reflected in these payments can you assist the Chair in that regard? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, this would be in a month, not a full month, I mean there 
were pages in the month but I haven’t got my black book here now, the actual list, the 
photostat copies to explain it and I did this over a month ago. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At what time during what years were these 
payments taking place. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We need to just look at the book, because on the top there 
20 
we’ve written the amounts. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay, carry on please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, if maybe one of the ladies’ can look at my old 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to the next page there is that TTV50CCV and then in 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 133 of 191 
 
the middle the name is MEC’s is that a particular MEC or would it be MEC’s? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The MEC’s initials or name I don’t know at least, sorry, that 
Thandi Mokoko would have to testify to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in respect of some of the money that you had to prepare. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would, in each case you would know to whom you would give it 
in terms of the distribution person as you indicate here, but in some cases you would 
know the individual to whom it was going to be paid. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in other cases you would not know the individuals, but maybe 
10 
you would simply know that they are associated with a certain entity or something, as 
you say here Limpopo or Youth Centres and so on, is that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the book was intended to help me check up on myself 
and if Gavin asked me a question within the next month, so within a month if you asked 
me, if I looked at that a month after I had given it I would be able to say yes I was 
dealing with Thandi on that, she told me she was going to see the MEC who is this 
person and she needed to take money with her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so even where you might have written here Limpopo you have a 
way of finding out who you were told the money would ultimately go to? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, I would always have to ask that question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Also same principle would apply, I thought I saw you sent us 
something, ja, you’ve sent us. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have a way if you got the documentation that you need, 
you would have a way of establishing who at the Youth Centres you had in mind when 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 134 of 191 
 
you were writing here Youth Centres? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair because it’s so old there’s no ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now but then you would be able to? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes no then I could tell you exactly because it was still fresh in 
my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With all of these at that time you would know how to establish the 
actual names of recipients.  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not be able to do it now because of the time lapse. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No exactly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Now my earlier books I used to actually write out the names 
and then I was told not to do that, to use codes, but in my earlier books which I think 
the one book we still saw on the video is still there, that book will probably have, 
because there were only three books or four books but that book will probably have the 
full names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you say that book is still probably the ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Remember we saw it I think ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, we saw it on the video. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Advocate picked it up ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 87? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  87 for instance there JCB was always Patrick’s nickname that 
I would use as well, then there’s MMM which (indistinct) Mgubo, 50IMN Ishmang 
Mwaba will take it through, Mwaba was his previous name then he changed it to 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 135 of 191 
 
Dekane.  MMB was Maria Mebena, MKB was Mkabela, SSS was Shishe Matabela, 
KOA was the Kloof Union, AMC was AMCU Union, KZN20RRD was Westville and that 
would be taken by Ryno Rhode, that was for one of the project offices at Westville.  
GAC was ACSA, MAC was Mohamed Bashier, BON was Bongi Mapungus at ACS, KZN 
was ACSA KZN Airport, that as well it would have been a once off, I think you saw in 
the video where Joe says look I need R10 000 to do this or this or this, that’s those type 
of things, then ORT25 would be OR Tambo, there must have been a special reason 
why they  wanted that.  Then DVT was a chap by the name of Trevor who was working 
for the MEC of the Youth Centres in the Western Cape and that would have been taken 
by Danie van Tonder, I remember we stopped that at one stage.  Then TMT50 would be 
10 
Mams Mibusa from Justice for Trevor.  ZMC was ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry did you say Justice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, Department of Justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mams Mibusa was from the Department of Justice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, so that would have been with the guarding contract or 
even potentially with the security systems contract.  I don’t know the date on top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then ZMC was Zac Madisi who was at that stage he was 
20 
acting so he wasn’t a full commissioner yet, then TRS was Transport 100, I don’t know 
why there was, there must have been a reason for that specific payment because it was 
normally R300 000, then SNK was Snake, SNL was Snail, RMT was Richmond Mti, 
Syvion Dlamini was 80, that was for Limpopo Youth Centre, then there was J20 that 
was for Lepinka, and then it was Syv which is Syvion Dlamini and Thandi, so both of 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 136 of 191 
 
them would have requested the 20 and that’s for Youth Centres, so you see Chair it’s 
all, it’s – it was a kind of a code that not even Russians could decipher, but I could 
explain it.  The only reason it was there was that I can explain it and correlate it for 
Gavin because he was very stickly on checking that people don’t steal his money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I wanted to be able to show him that what you gave me to 
do I’ve done and there’s the change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, just before you go on SNK is the code for 
Giba as I understand it. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Snake ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And SNL Snail is the code for Mgoybi, you’ve 
given that evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s right ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now I just want to make sure JM15 one third of 
the way down from the top did you mention that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Which one? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   JM15.  I missed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  JM15 in the first ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In the first column, oh that’s our marker, 15, for some or other 
20 
reason I can’t read the other things I wrote, or I didn’t write codes behind it but that’s 
just our marker. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the figures in the middle of the code 
denote to say amounts? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 137 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we go to page 88 then please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let’s go through it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay you’ve got JGM which is Joe Gumede would collect it 
and I said you know sometimes I just use the same, I batch them all together, so I knew 
the Airports Company  was batched together, so those are all ACA, so those were 
ACSA, JGM50 are ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Agrizzi I wanted to ask you earlier on in the codes the 
last two or three letters of the code by the way in terms of what you told me last time 
was there a principal you were following in deciding on the code or not really? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not really Chair, I would put if it was difficult to remember I 
would be more precise but if I knew it was 30, 30, 30 to go to ACSA you know Joe 
Gumede was collecting it because what I would do is after we’d packed it I would put it 
in another bag, in the China Mall they used to buy them by the dozen for me, China 
Mall bags and we’d pack it in there and I would write on a note this is Joe Gumede, this 
is what you must take, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but have you just said something about what ACA 
represented in those codes which bear that name? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would say ACSA, but instead of writing ACSA I would just 
write ACA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you would just change it a bit, ja, okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It’s a weird shorthand but it worked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because even I after a year can’t decipher most, some of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You may proceed.  You were reading ...(intervention)  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 138 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, okay then JGM it’s Joe Gumede, 50 for Mams Mibusa, 
JGM, 25 TAU and that was for Norman Thubane and I remember that because I often if 
I gave somebody a nickname I would use their nickname as well, JGM10 was KZN, that 
was ACSA, PGC ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m not sure whether you are still reading the codes as well, 
I thought earlier on with the other pages you were reading the codes plus the name and 
the distribution list.  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh, okay, alright, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it’s better that you do it that way. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, sorry Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do the complete the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so that it’s actually ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Start again at the top, JGM was 30ACA and that was for 
Jason Chabalala and Joe Gumede would collect that.  JGM 30ACA that was for Bongi, 
not at ACSA, that’s incorrect, there was a company there called ACS that she worked 
for that we did the screening for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’m sorry what is not correct there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Bongi ACS, it should be at ACS, not ACSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I can explain, ACS is a screening company that does work 
20 
at ACSA and we had a contract with the screening company, and that’s the contact we 
had there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the code next to her name is correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but just the – what you wrote after her name was not correct?  
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 139 of 191 
 
You need that to be ACS not ACSA? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but the ACSA that is on the two, first two is fine? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine, okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one is the head of security and the other one is the 
procurement officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, proceed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay then you’ve got JGM10KZN  that would have been one 
of those weird requests again by Joe Gumede, they would always make those type of 
10 
requests because I don’t know if the money actually went to the people but it would 
always be R10 000 Chair.  PGC Patrick Gillingham, that was 110, RMT was 85, then it 
was SST ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, you’ve left out a few, let’s go back to 
JGM50MAM. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay that Mams Mibusa for JGM50 MAM, was Mams Mibusa 
for Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and JGM25 was THAU 
which was Norman Thubane, JGM was KZN, that would have been ACSA, it would 
have been a special request from Joe Gumede.  PGC110CCV that would be Patrick 
Gillingham and I would have to take it to him.  RMT85CCV was Richmond Mti and there 
20 
was a reason why I put Agrizzi there because I would also deliver with Gavin or Gavin 
would do it or I would have to just drop it off, and then you’ve got SST100 that was for 
Jolingana what actually happened there was we were given an extension to the 
catering and that was the agreement that R100 000 would go a month to the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that Correctional Services contract? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 140 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and Jolingana was one of the people at the ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes one of the Commissioners that was involved with the 
extension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So what happened was because those were Richmond Mti’s 
people he would give them the money, who would give it to him and he would give it to 
them, so for instance with the – there’s another lady there Grace Molethedi, when they 
– they had to motivate and they motivated that they outsource Groenpunt Prison and I 
can’t remember the other name of the prison now,. There were two prisons, so they 
10 
were R50 000 each so she got R100 000 a month.  Okay, and then you’ve got the 
SST100CCV alright, now that was (indistinct) SST100SNL which is for a mistake on my 
side it should have been SNK. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that an error? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s an error. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So SNL should be ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, but it was an error in my book, I remember I transferred it 
like that, but I can tell you exactly that that was there, because that went to Mti and that 
was the reason for it.  I wrote, my handwriting was so bad because I use a fountain pen 
so I must have smudged it, so that’s how I read it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the error is in your book, not here? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the error is my fault in the book. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, where you say there’s an error is it at SST100SNL? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 141 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, it should have been SNK. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SN? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  K. 
CHAIRPERSON:  K at the end? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the problem is Chair I write in a fountain pen, and the 
books are very full, so I must have smudged it and it looks like an L, so I didn’t want to 
change what was in the book to what was here.  So this ...(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I think I – the SNK should replace SST and 
10 
not SNL? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I initially thought the error was on SNL but I’m looking at the previous 
page it seems that SNK should be at the beginning of the code. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well these, I used to swap it around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So just to get it right in regard to the code at page 88 so is 
it S, is it the L of SN that is wrong? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it should have read SST100SNK for Snake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I understood it correct earlier on, I just got confused when I 
...(intervention)  
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no I understand, I was confused as well trying to decipher 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay then we have SNK29SLE which is also it’s because the 
book smudged. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 142 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m sorry, I’m going to disturb you again Mr Agrizzi I think part of 
what confused me was that I thought if I looked at the previous page I would find the 
same code for the same person, but – and I saw it ended with ACB for that person on 
the previous page but here it’s ending with different letters. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair let me tell you why I did this because if I remember 
correctly the cash used to be packed by Jacques van Zyl according to a list I would give 
him and I would give him always the same standard codes, and he started deciphering 
it and Joe Gumede and myself, Joe Gumede actually reported to me that he is 
concerned because this guy is keeping all the notes and that’s why we changed the 
codes, if you remember right in the beginning that’s how it worked. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, so when one reads what you have here from page – is it 86, 
from 86 to 88 or it goes on and elsewhere one should not when one sees a particular 
code for a particular person think that that’s the code that will always appear next to 
that name. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not necessarily going to be that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Never, it could never be the same.  Sometimes I would you 
know you make it up as you go along but sometimes I would make a mistake and I 
would use the same codes but I tired always to vary it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Otherwise it becomes a trail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And basically you would be the only person who would know this 
one, this code still belongs to that one even though that other code also did belong to 
the same person some other time. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It sounds extremely suspicious but remember I was the only 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 143 of 191 
 
one that had to decipher it, nobody else, I needed to be able to open my book if I was 
asked a question by Gavin Watson, which happened maybe once every year, and be 
able to explain to him a reconciliation that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, and in your own mind you would usually know why you are 
deciding on a particular code to be able to connect it with a particular person. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So if I can give you an example, INC would Ismail Ngwaba, 
now I normally would put that at the end but here I’ve got MNG, which is (indistinct), 
MN, so I would change it, one week it might be or one month it might be MAM or it 
10 
might MTM meaning that you know that’s for – but I know the amounts and the names I 
can correlate with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I interrupted you, you may proceed with finishing reading the 
list on page 88. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright, so we got GMT I think. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No we went to (indistinct) SST100SNL and you 
explained why the code had changed, well the code didn’t change you just made an 
error. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it smudged or something like that, I can’t remember. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, so your black book looks like SNL and this 
20 
is ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is a reflection of the black book yes.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright then move on then please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then for instance J was for Mgwebi, there I mixed up the two 
as well, it’s also 20 for Lepinka and 10 for Mgwebi  then GMT100SLE that was Grace 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 144 of 191 
 
Molethedi. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just before you go on, the code for 
Mgwebi had also changed. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I made a mistake, I presume I made a mistake. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Well as it may implicate people how 
did you make the mistake?  Is it still your evidence that Mgwebi received an amount of 
R10 000? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, maybe what I should have done is attached the actual 
papers here and I need to get those papers and for tomorrow morning I can attach the 
originals and put them with these, and I will see how I made the mistakes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, okay, then let’s go on to GMT. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  GMT was Grace Molethedi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s GMT100 ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was for the two contracts, that was for the two contracts 
and I would have used SLE because it referred to Richmond Mti. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  IMC50? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was Joe Marco I used, I remember distinctly having to 
pack that, IMC20 was Mkebela, IMC50 was Dikelele and I know that because I packed 
it regularly.  AMC20 was the AMCU Union, NUM100 was the NUM Union, SDL was 
Syvion Dlamini and that would have been the Youth Centres in the North West, ELS 
20 
was 30 and that would have Alfred at Kloof, 57500 for some or other reason I didn’t 
write a code, it was for Nele, and ASB40 was for Andries Sibelele at Empowerdex who I 
gave R40 000 to, to sort out the BEE ratings. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I may not have been following, it’s late in the 
day, but I think you left out one or two, but just for the record on page 88 the recipient of 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 145 of 191 
 
the amounts reflected in code in the left hand column are named in the middle column? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The person who distributed the money to that 
recipient is listed in the right hand column. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, let’s go then to page 80 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do so I think for the record we must just indicate that 
some of the codes the witness has called the whole code but in others he didn’t call the 
whole code, the complete list is in Exhibit S9, starting from page 87, is that correct?  
10 
86. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  86. 
CHAIRPERSON:  86 to, is it 291 Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To page 91. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To 91, I just want to make sure when anybody reads the transcript 
later they shouldn’t think that that’s a complete list when those last two or three letters 
haven’t been stated. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes so again I could be wrong, but for the sake 
of completeness and accuracy can we read onto the record the names and codes and 
distribution person from Molentan Guba, those after that, even if it’s a repetition, I think 
20 
we left out some. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it’s just important to get them accurately. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no problem.  No problem, I don’t know why I actually 
wrote this differently, it might have, I was doing this as a matter of fact when I was 
sitting during lunch times in the first section.  Sorry on which page are we now? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 146 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  88. 
CHAIRPERSON:  88. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  88, from Molentan Guba? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright, Molentan Guba, then you’ve got IMC50SHI that was 
for Sishi Matabela, that was a once off arrangement if I recall. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Why is there an amount in brackets, which is 
the amount paid then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  50. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  50? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  50 okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, the 50 is the amount paid, why the amount is in brackets I 
wrote something in my book but I think there was an agreement that we get a 100 in 
total and it was 50 and 50 the following month, I can’t tell you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright I do not know why a hundred is in brackets.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is over – this is over a couple of years ago so IMC 30 
MAC that was Joe Marco, IMC 20 MKC that was Mkhabela, so IMC 50 DDV that was 
20 
Dikeledi Tshabalala.  AMC 20 that was the Amco Union, NUM 100 that was the union 
for NUM at Kloof.  TMT 50 was the youth centre Thandi Makoko and it was 50 for the 
youth centres in Gauteng.  And STL 50 was the Sylvion Dlamini and that was the youth 
centres in the North West.  EOF was for a gentleman called Elfod he was the client at 
Kloof Mine and there is – I have not got the paper now but there is 57500 which was 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 147 of 191 
 
the standard amount M Nxele and I recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is M Nxele? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the last amount? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is M Nxele? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the end. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know if that is the right spelling but that is how I know 
10 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think it is correct. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then do you have an amount ASB 40 
BEE? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry just repeat it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 88 the page we have. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The last amount? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes ASB that is for a gentleman that did the empowered ex-
20 
rating and his agreement was he would give us a preferential rating if he got 
R40 000,00 per company. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Bosasa obtained a favourable BEE rating 
from the rating agency by way of bribe? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 148 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes again it is suggested to me that the figure 
that appears in the middle of the code for example 30 should be understood to 
represent R30 000,00 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In the middle yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Normally. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They should be read in thousands? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Then page 89 if you go through 
them slowly please 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  PGC is Patrick Gillingham.  I would distribute it.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just to note here we do have a date 
March 2016 here. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That would have been on my piece of paper. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  I am sorry I interrupted you.  Go on 
please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay PGC is 110 which is Patrick Gillingham.  NWPC 700 so 
there would have been two payments and this was probably the software payment to 
Tsede.  Sylvion Dlamini handled that.  I knew about it.  I knew where the money was 
going.  NWPC was 1.5 million that would be also Tsede Sylvion Dlamini delivered that.  
20 
KLF 100 CCY was Kloof Union which is Ishmael Dekhane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in relation to the code NWPC 1500 CCV you are saying that that 
1500 which might thought to be 1500 is – it represents 1,5 million? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 149 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  1.5 million and 700 thousand.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say 700 000 because you know – you know about it but there 
is no – nothing here that in the code that tells you it is 700 000. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No NWPC North West R700 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  700 denotes R700 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So every figures is a thousand times the 
figure? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  NWPC that is 1.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  CCV that was a bulk payment that went to that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  KLF is Kloof 100 that would be for the Union at Kloof.  LIB was 
Libanon NUM union Ishmael Dekhane would take that.  KZN 57,5 DCB was Nxele and 
you see – so Chair if I can just add here.  Some numbers are always the same.  The 
same people collecting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Taking it to the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I always knew exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  How it was going and there were similarities in every month. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 150 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sometimes there were deviations but not that often. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  MMM was [indistinct] MM was Maria Mabena.  SMA was 
Shushi Mathabela.  ISM was Joe Marco.  AMC was Amco Union.  STL was Sylvion 
Dlamini that was R80 000,00 for the North West.  ACB 85 was Richmond Mti.  GML was 
there I have got GML 100 CCB [indistinct] that was for John Ngana but then I have got 
a duplicate there GML later on but I will get to that.  Okay.  So you got GML 100 CCB 
that was for John Ngana.  SNK which was Snake 100.  G Bovante.  MID 50 was the 
nickname for John Ngana was middledrift.  GML was Grace … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry this one says second Joel Ngana? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  So there was two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so there is two Joel Ngana’s. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is what I am referring to.  So there was 100 and there 
was a 100 in GML alright there is 100 okay.  And then there is MID.  So the first GML 
went to Joel Ngana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  Then you got SNK.  Then you got MID.  Now MID stood 
for Middledrift which was Joel Ngana’s nickname. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That Mti gave her.  I did not nickname anybody.  All the 
nicknames came from the persons that I would work with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The distribution people. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  They would give me the nicknames as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja okay. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 151 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just want to make it clear that nobody thinks I am calling 
people snakes and pigs and things like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright so then you GML which is Grace Moltedi which is 100.  
Then you got SNL which is Snail 10 J Jackie Lapinka which is 20.  PLC is transport 
which is 300 and it is picked up by Papa Leshabane that is why it is PL and then PL 
which was 50 was for a list of Lindela people.  So he would have given me a list or 
shown me a list of people he wanted to take care of at Home Affairs or Lindela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The list continues then on page 90. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of S9. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the month appears to be June. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It says note June so I presume so. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Would you go through that list please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  TRM would be transport that was 300 and Papa Leshabane 
would have collected it.  TRM 45 plus 10 that was also Papa Leshabane.  He would 
sometimes come with a list and show me the list and say these are the people.  Then I 
20 
would take that list – what it was written on a post it or a piece of paper and I would go 
and discuss it with Gavin.  And say he wants to pay this one, this one, this one, this 
one.  That is where journalists and all that came into it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay.  So PL 50 was Amco.  PL 30 was Kloof Mine Elford and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 152 of 191 
 
why I had it PL there was because that was Patrick Littler and there was a takeover 
between Ishmael and Patrick Littler they swopped roles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then Patrick would have to take over these people.  Then 
you have got IMC which was the Driefontein Union which was then run by Ishmael.  I 
have got IMC 57.5.  Now the 57.5 everybody knew that it was one person that got 57.5 
and that was Mr Nxele.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  M Nxele.  So I do not know why I put the Ishmael Mncwaba 
but I do not know why I used DRDR.  I cannot tell you.  It seems like I got lazy and I 
10 
started not writing the codes out properly.  Probably did.  MM was Maria Mabena.  JM 
was Jose Marco. Shishi I just wrote Shish 50.  Shishi Mathabela.  I think sometimes 
Chair you get tired of thinking of now what code am I going to use now you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I just – I was fedup probably or late and I just wrote 
anything down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  DIN 10 I remember that was Deneo at Eastern Cape St 
Albans.  Ngubu I actually wrote his name there.  Shushi I wrote another 50 because 
Ishmael came back to me at that stage and said we got to give her another 50.  AMCO 
20 
was the union.  So sometimes I just got tired of writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I just wrote names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And before you go to the next page. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 153 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third name from the bottom at page 19 on the code you have got 
Ngubo. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the name in middle column you have got Ngibo I assume that 
is supposed to be Ngubo as well. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is my spelling error. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Chair.  As I said I did these while I was waiting during 
the lunch breaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  During the last session okay.  Then there was January to 
February 2015.  Most of these are employees.  Elfod would be given to Patrick Littler.  
You see sometimes I just wrote up the full names.  Unfortunately.  And I do not know 
why I did it I cannot answer it but that is what I did.  Elfod is 40 Kloof.  Carlos Bonafacio 
got 10.  Andries Erasmus I think it was Andries Erasmus ja 10 000.  Then Ryno would 
get 5 000.  Danie Van Tonder 5.  Leon Van Tonder 5 and Doctor Loius Skoltz got 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry so here on page 91. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like you departed from one of the principles you were 
following in terms of the code to say the… 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not write the actual amount in the code.  If it is 50 it meant 
R50 000.00.  If it was 100 it would be R100 000,00.  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But here you were writing the actual amounts. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 154 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Exactly.  Why I did it – I mean that is 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it might have been that in 2015 I did not write the codes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I honestly… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I need to get all the books. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know the book I got was the last book that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And a couple of pieces of paper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I am not mistaken this was where I would issue – sorry 
Chair.  I think this is on one of the A4 papers it is – I think it was an A4 piece of paper.  I 
will have to look at the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But that was Andries Erasmus, Ryno Rhoode, Danie Van 
Tonder, Leon Van Tonder, Doctor Louis Skoltz and I would give that to Jacques Van Zyl 
20 
he would just distribute it.  Then there was R50 000,00 for the Western Cape.  I know 
that one of our ex-employees Dave McNamarra there was payment for him.  Probably 
R20 000,00 because I know Trevor Fourie who was the assistant to the MEC would get 
R30,000,00. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think you left out Thandi Makoko. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 155 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Thandi Makoko she wanted to use R75 000,00 for the 
Youth Centres. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  She did not tell me exactly what it was.  What could have 
actually happened here as well was that I might not have been present and I just 
transcribed it from the notes that Jacques Van Zyl kept.  I might have been away or 
something and I would have phoned him and said listen just sort this out for these 
people.  So it could have changed.  I cannot explain why. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then we move to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then you have got the North West – sorry Western Cape I 
10 
have explained.  North West MEC 50 Sylvion Dlamini.  Richmond was 65 then.  Geba 
was 100.  Joel Ngana was 100.  Grace Moletedi was 100.  Mrebe was 10 and Jackie 
was 10. And the reason I noticed here Richmond Mti had dropped was because this 
was 2015.  In 2016 he got more. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Jackie at the bottom of that column is 
20 000,00? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you go back up and I do not think we have 
missed anyone out Carlos Bonifacio  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And some of the others  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Including Leon Van Tonder were employees of 
Bosasa why were they receiving monies? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know it was like everybody. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 156 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  {indistinct] according to you’re a papers. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja it was like everybody because if you received cash and 
who did not – who you know did not accept it.  I mean if the boss comes to you and you 
boss gives you R10 000,00 you know it is your boss he is giving you R10 000.00. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So these are correct “bonus payments” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well they are bonus payments but they actually keep quiet 
payments because as long as you keep quiet you will get your money. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is the truth of the fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you have some notes.  Would you 
explain those please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja.  I just – I do not know why I made notes – well I would 
have made notes but I cannot exactly understand this but if I understand my wording of 
it.  Reconciliation I transferred back to Petty Cash borrowed from Jacques Van Zyl 
R107 000,00.  So in other words they did not have enough cash.  So we would have 
had to borrow from petty cash and the delivery let us say was R1 million.  So 
R107 000,00 would have to go back to petty cash because the auditors check that.  So 
you had a cash loan of R107 000,00 you had to pay back.  So to be taken off the order 
to be delivered.  Explanation is there must have been an urgent need for R107 000,00 
20 
so it was borrowed from Petty cash Bosasa and would be replaced with the following 
delivery.  Okay so that explained it.  That if you borrowed from petty cash when the 
delivery came in you would have to take out of that delivery and put it back into the 
petty cash box.  On the 18 February 2016 this was just a reconciliation received an 
amount of 3.2 then a further delivery of 2.8 on the 25 February 2016 the total amount… 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 157 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  R3.2 million and R2.8 million? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct yes.  The total amount being R6 million less the 
R107 000,00.  So these were notes that I would have made so that if Mr Watson wants 
to verify you know I mean the money – there is the money, there is the amounts.  That 
is how it worked out.  The amount less the packaging amounts would then be deposited 
– would amount to that which was deposited in the safe.  That is basically what it 
means.  Sorry my handwriting is atrocious.  And I battle to understand it myself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Also as part of HH you have several emails on 
page 92 and following. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But I understand those to relate to a different 
topic which we will come to. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes there is one – one email and I will tell you which one it is 
which relates to the same topic okay which is the codes.  So sometimes I would be 
away and I would not be able to do the codes myself so for instance in 2012 that is 
when I would still give lists through to – and I did not do the cash.  The cash was 
handled by Jacque Van Zyl.  But people would still have to come to me and speak to 
me and motivate it so that we could get Gavin to approve it.  So here is for instance an 
email from myself to Jacques Van Zyl.  I must have been busy.  I called the codes 
biometrix.   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that page 103, 104 and 106? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry 95, 95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are we in now? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  95. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 158 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The email from yourself to Jacques Van Zyl of 
9 May 2012 has a number of codes similar to the codes that you have been testifying 
about now to the Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The subject is Codes Biometrix what does that 
mean? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well what was – where I had been fortunate is I managed to 
get hold of somebody at the office and they pulled my archive folders I mentioned 
earlier.  So this is all new.  I printed this out now in the last week.  And these codes 
biometrix are just codes biometrix.  What it refers to is it is – the reason why it is codes 
biometrix is because I was taught by Gavin that if the SIU come and they want to 
search they are going to search for codes cash or things like that so rather use 
biometrix because biometrix talk about – we had a biometrix system put in and that.  So 
Jacques was in charge of doing the biometrix system and if anybody looked at this 
thing biometrix codes so what.  Alright these are codes I would have given to him to 
pack.  I cannot remember all the codes now but ISM would be Patrick Gillingham – I 
20 
cannot tell you what they were.  I – you know they were so – they were done 
electronically and he would have written them and I would have known where they had 
to go.  But you can see there Chair that this proves the point on the 9 May at 2:20 I sent 
them to him.  I must have been very busy in prepping or a meeting and I was on my 
way out and you know the – what used to happen was I would have a string of people 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 159 of 191 
 
outside my office.  I literally there were people in my office all the time.  So I would have 
typed this quick, sent it to him, say pack it and just get it ready they will come fetch it.  
Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 98/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a rather strange email from Danie 
Roodt to Joe Gumede. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I.. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it talks about houses and furniture. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I cannot remember exactly what this is about.  It is part of 
10 
the emails that I have printed out.  I have got to – I have asked them to get me the 
inbox and not only the outbox. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 99 we talk about or you in an 
email to Jacques Van Zyl talks about 550 loaves. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  So the other thing was loaves of bread.  So that was in 
2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that?  What was loaves of bread? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Loaves of bread was money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So one one loaf is R100 000. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you at some stage. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  At some stage you talked about chicken. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chicken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And some time – other times you talked about loaves. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 160 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For money? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. So you changed it all the time I was told.  Remember I 
was taught by probably the best skelm ever you know so he taught me all these tricks. 
He told me what to write. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he would say loaves and I would then get Jacques Van Zyl.  
I did not get involved with the cash in terms of handling cash and that.  I only did that if 
you recall in my testimony when there was a problem that Jacques was recording 
people’s names and that and Joe Gumede was very concerned.  So I then wrote him I 
10 
think it was for Joe Gumede or somebody.  Please start arranging the monthly book at 
least 550 loaves for now.  So that is R550 000,00. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure many wise people would be 
fooled by that code. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:    Well I progressed.  I was taught.  No but at the end of the 
day I will arrange for next week probably is there is no funds currently and thus I cannot 
make a booking at the bakery.  Also who will collect as I will be in Cape Town.  That 
was just – that is just a sample of you know how this has been 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Inherent in the company for so many, many years. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then if you go to 101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you go. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I can explain that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to 101 I do not know if Mr Pretorius intended to deal 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 161 of 191 
 
with this.  The email at the top of 99 – page 99 is that a response to your loaves email 
or I see it talks about booking at the bakery and collection coming from Jacques Van 
Zyl. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that a response or was that not – was that separate? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No that is a response from him to me to say there is no 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In the company we cannot… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so… 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We cannot book the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – you – well there is an email right at the bottom of page 99 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Corect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Jacque Van Zyl to you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Saying, still no money from Westville or IDD yet we did receive MIY’s 
money R2.8 million and Mavamve R750 000,00 plus ACSA R2.5million.  Well that – it 
does not look like there is a code there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a code? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No that is actual – he is telling me has got a problem with the 
debtors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – but – so this is – this one does not refer to any bribery 
money? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no that … 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 162 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is just – ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is actual debtors from Westville. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he is telling me they have not received money yet and I am 
saying to him, well you better get 550 loaves ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not knowing I mean I know that – Chair if I can explain how I 
used to operate and how I worked?  Is I would be live time with everything that 
happened in the company all the time.  I knew exactly what was happening.  I needed 
to know what the debtors was. What the creditors was.  I had all this information within 
10 
me all the time and operating.  And then I would get a request.  So what probably would 
have happened there I can tell you now is that I responded to his mail at 8:37 alright?  
So I was probably in front of my computer in a meeting probably with one of the 
directors and they reminded me that they need 550 loaves.  So I would have quickly 
while the email was still open said to him listed get me 500 loaves somebody is waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is how – you know there was no formality in how to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your email of 1 July 2011 at four minutes nine addressed to 
Jacques Van Zyl. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it a response to the email at the bottom? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No okay.  Okay.  And the one at the top on the same page from 
Jacques Van Zyl to you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 163 of 191 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it a response to your one in the middle? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So sometimes it was easier – yes.  It is a response but he is 
also adding more information for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He is saying the Sondolo creditors are starting to shout for 
their payments.  So he is saying to me as well listen we need more money in.  So one 
of the things I used to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Was pick up the phone and start phoning people for money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right to think that your email in the middle of that page and 
10 
Jacques Van Zyl’s – Jacques Van Zyl ‘s one at the top those are talking about bribery 
money because you talk about loaves he talks about bakery. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Bakery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the one at the bottom talks about money in the normal sense? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the top two. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk about bribery money. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So if you look at the date Chair if I may just mention to you.  It 
is the 1 July.  It is the first day of the new month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the new month ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And now it is pressure because we have to get money in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 164 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And we have to get money out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And sometimes the money in and the money out were 
dependent on each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So if you did not have the bribe money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You could not keep people happy.  If you could not keep 
people happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They did not pay their accounts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that is why it is all interlinked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But it was pressurised time at that stage because at that stage 
the company was literally also going through a very bad patch financially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 101 if we can move there.  
There is talk of management fees. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry can I just – on page 100. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  101. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I just bring your attention to page 100.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If you look it is very small I do not know – unfortunately my 
printer at home does not work that well.  But it says on 100.  Monday the 28 February 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 165 of 191 
 
please Jacques lets me – he sends me an email but he only fills in the heading.  He 
says: please let me know when you have chance or change to discuss the bread roll 
requirements. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that something different from a loaf? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it is bread rolls so it is money. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is still money. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is still money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay I just thought I would bring that to your attention. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is writing now there?  Is it Jacques Van Zyl to you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that is also at the 28 February 2011.  Because at the end 
of the month what used to happen was the directors would hound me and they would 
come to me and say oo lambele you know, the people are hungry, they want their 
money. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 101 you talk about Sondolo’s 
management fee is that genuine, is that code? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct that is code as well.  If I can explain to you this was 
20 
the transaction done for the placing of access control, CCTV systems in Correctional 
Centres, courts right around the country.  So the agreement there was 2.5% of the total 
amount paid.  So if the Department of Justice paid say an amount of R100 million then 
immediately they would get reimbursed the money would go to Seopela who would get 
2.5% of the R100 million as the bribe money in cash and that would be delivered to 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 166 of 191 
 
him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And is that the reference to a management 
fee? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  So if you – ja so that is one of them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 103 if we may go there.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is the 27th. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Contains more codes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For biometric readers? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  More codes on the following page 104? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. So this is when I was not doing it myself.  This is 
when I had – Jacques Van Zyl was doing it and I would send him an email and he 
would prep the code and prep the packets and they would be delivered. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on page 106 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We have correspondence by email in March 
2012 Friday the 23 March 2012 where requests are made for codes for ACSA and 
those requests are complied with? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  What would have happened there Chair is I might 
20 
have been out of the office and I would have got a request from Gumede I did not want 
to phone.  I might have been sitting in a meeting and I would have sent a quick email to 
Jacques van Zyl to say…  I spoke to Joe Gumede.  Please use the following code ACS 
which was ACS15JGS, Joe Gumede.   
So, then Jacques van Zyl would respond to me and say to me that the code 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 167 of 191 
 
is ready for collection and he has notified Joe as well.  So, Joe would come and collect 
the code. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, it is just after four.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like us, if at all possible, to go on for some time, so that 
tomorrow we are more confident that he will finish.  I do not what is your estimate of 
how much time we will need tomorrow if we stop now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  It is difficult to predict, but I had thought 
that the evidence of Mr Agrizzi would take over two days.  It looks like we are going at a 
rate that will take just under two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Although, we are not yet halfway through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The problem which makes it a little bit 
unpredictable is that we had been dealing up to now with answers to questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Very soon…  In fact, after these emails have 
been dealt with, we are going to be dealing with new information.  So, that may take a 
little longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, from my point of view if it is convenient to Mr Agrizzi and it is 
convenient to you, I am quite happy to go on until at least five. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Five? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am prepared to hear...[intervenes] 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 168 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [Indistinct] to say they would, but, I am 
happy...[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your situation now?  I would like us to try and use as much 
time as possible.  I do not go beyond tomorrow with him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My own estimate is that it ought to be possible to finish with 
tomorrow, but of course, we have to use the time that we have optimally.  So, if it is fine 
with you as well I am happy to go up to five.  If you have challenges, maybe we can go 
up to half past four and maybe tomorrow start earlier. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, can we review the situation at half past 
10 
four? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  All right.  It is fine.  Mr Agrizzi, you said you are fine either 
way? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I do not think you want to see me here again.  So, let us 
get it done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Okay.  No, that is fine.  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  All right, let us go back to the emails at page 
108.  I do not know if I have left anything out.  Here we talk about or you talk about 
proof of payment for invoice nut.  Is that a code or is that genuine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, this is genuine.  These are one of the other favours that 
20 
I…  Please understand Chair that I have not just put – rub anything in here.  I have tried 
to get the emails and I have just been able to get access to some of the emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now this year…  Well, specifically a payment 
for a gentleman who worked at ACSA called Ruben Pillay.  He was one of the security 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 169 of 191 
 
managers and here you can see that there was a car service that needed to be done 
and for some or other reason it was called Big Boss Auto and the amount paid by 
Bosasa for this was for an Audi S3 and the amount paid was R46 853,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is on page 109? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  109.  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So, this would have been authorised by Joe Gumede 
because...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, what page are you on? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  108 and 109. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  108.  Yes.  The recipient is Big Boss Auto? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  And the person who is copied into the email is a guy 
by the name of Ruben Pillay.  Who was at ACSA at the time and the amount was for a 
repair of his vehicle, because his vehicle was constantly in for repairs.  I remember it 
vividly.   
 
So, if you go…  So, the trial I am trying to show you, Chair is that, if they take 
these invoices and they go and have a look at the books of the payments of 2010, 
14th December.  They will pick up.  There was a payment made and the payment was 
made in respect of Bosasa Operations and was for R46 853,00. 
 
They will then be able to see on the journal exactly the code which is used in 
20 
the creditors file.  So, if you then go to the creditors file, after taking the reference from 
Great Plains, you would be able to pick the invoice and you would have to look – you 
would be able to see that the car…  This is the car registration.  This is the invoice.  
This is what was done.  And ultimately, who authorised it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 170 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who was the beneficiary of the payment? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Big Boss Auto. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But the beneficiary...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On whose behalf was the payment made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ruben Pillay from ACSA. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you mentioned Great Plains.  That is a 
software...[intervenes]  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Great Plains is the computer software program. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Run by whom? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, it is run by Bosasa.  It is a Microsoft product. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So, it is Bosasa’s program. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, this is a banking slip which you all know and then if you…  
Because the amount will correlate to…  You cannot just do a payment at Bosasa.  
There has got be at least four, five signatures on an EFT transfer.   
 
So, you would have to have a purchase order.  You would have to have two 
signatures from the originator.  Then you would have to have my signature or Andries 
van Tonder’s signatures or Carlos Bonifacio’s signature.  Then you would have to have 
a director’s signature as well, before the payment could be made. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 110, there is reference to a funeral in 
20 
an email from Jacques van Zyl to yourself and Thandi Makoko. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So, this is how things happened.  You get a request.  You 
would have to get R10 000,00 ready.  I would draft an email.  It is for a director.  It goes 
through and it is just signed off.  So, I just want you to see how things normally would 
work. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 171 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, that appears on page 111 at the top of the 
page. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where you request Jacques van Zyl to draw 
R10 000,00 to be forwarded to Thandi Makoko. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the CSI at a funeral on the weekend.  CSI 
being? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The CSI being Corporate Social Investment. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Investment.  Who was the beneficiary of this 
10 
amount? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thandi Makoko would have been the beneficiary.  I do not 
know, you know, who would be the ultimate person that was being buried.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 112 is an email from Jacques van Zyl 
to yourself. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Dated 13th February 2012. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Subject is:  Request for donation.  Could you 
explain what that is about? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So, often certain of the directors took chances, Chair and they 
would go via somebody else to try, but it all would have to come to myself because I 
would have to phone Gavin and get approval on that.   
So, I was probably sitting with Gavin at this stage and I would have said yes 
or no.  I do not have the response that I put in.  I just have the actual email. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 172 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It appears here that Thandi Makoko requested 
Bosasa to make a donation of R5 000,00 to a third party. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 113...[intervenes]  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry.  I just want to add something.  If I am not mistaken…  
No, it is not the same Zuki that introduced Jacob Zuma to Gavin Watson.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 113.  An email from yourself to Jacques 
van Zyl, Joe Gumede and Carlos Bonifacio. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Subject:  Joe Gumede.  The text reads: 
10 
“Jacques, sorry we have really bad signals.  Is it possible to 
arrange 30 loafs for Joe.  If you can liaise with, please…” 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  That shows you who would collect the money and that 
was bribe money.  You have to go and bribe somebody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So, you had to provide Joe Gumede with 30 
loafs or R30 000,00. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, if it was really bread, it would say white or brown. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we then please go back? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the heading:  Further supplementary 
20 
information and Facts.  Just to put this section in context.  You have now dealt with the 
questions raised by the Chair and others during your evidence on the previous 
occasion and you are now going to raise new matters for the benefit of the commission.  
Correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 173 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  All right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, you said we got what page, Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  H’m. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You begin by clarifying the position or positions 
you held at Bosasa. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I think it is important, Chair to clarify the position I held at 
Bosasa.  So, the position I held at Bosasa was of Chief Operations Officer.  Sometimes 
it was called Group Chief Operations Officer, but whatever it was called the name and 
the position of Gavin Watson was never ever mentioned in for instance their SIU report, 
10 
nor did it, you know, mention that my influence is very limited, in actual fact. 
 
I was never ever registered as a director.  Even though, I was theoretically 
an office bearer, but I was not registered as a director.  Nor was I at any stage a 
shareholder in the Bosasa Group of Companies, whereas in the SIU report, it actually 
eludes to me being the CEO and a shareholder as well. 
 
I just want to clarify that, but ultimately I reported to a board of directors and I 
reported to the Chief Executive Officer who was also the shareholder, Gavin Watson.  
That was the reporting line.  There were very strict and stringent rules. 
 
My normal course of business and duties would include making operational 
decisions within constraints.  I want to get away from this myth that I ran the company.  
20 
I never ran the company.  I had no aspirations, nor do I have any aspirations to run that 
kind of company, but I would still have to consult with each division. 
 
So, my responsibility, even as a Group Chief Operations Officer, I would still 
have to consult with every single divisional director before I could take any decision 
whatsoever. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 174 of 191 
 
 
I could not just make a decision on for instance who do we employee.  That 
was not allowed.  I will get backlash from Human Resources.  Especially, from Papa 
Leshabane.  I was not allowed to argue…  You know, I could provide a CV and say I 
feel this person would be of assistance, but I was never allowed to make the final 
decision on it. 
 
I did not have access to any bank accounts in the company or the financial 
packages used.  So, if you talk about Great Plains, what I know about Great Plains is I 
would query invoices that would come to me and the accountants would come with all 
the Great Plains documentation and show me what was happening, so that I 
understood it better. 
10 
 
But I had no access whatsoever to financial records.  Nor I did have any 
access…  And in fact, the directors themselves do not have access to the financial 
records of the company.  They never have had access to the bank accounts.  
 
So, they do not know…  The only person that had access to the bank 
accounts was the financial accountant who was put in that position and in the case of 
the financials and the bank accounts, it was Andries van Tonder and Carlos Bonifacio 
and Tony Perry. 
 
So, if I wanted to request information like profits and losses of the 
companies, I would have had to get that directly from accounts.  I would have to 
request it via Gavin Watson and say:  Look, I want to know what the profits are.  What 
20 
the costs are incurred.  And this was a rule for everybody.  No director was allowed to 
go and ask what the figures were in the company.  It was just a no, no. 
 
The payment regimes and protocols required numerous signatures.  So, you 
would have at least four to six signatures on a document to be able to get a payment 
through and to get an order through. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 175 of 191 
 
 
So, it would require no less than two other signatures.  So, you would need 
the originator’s signature, the person who is placing the order plus it would need two 
other signatures.  One of which had to be the chief accountant and the director. 
 
So, what I am trying to explain, Chair is that, if we go into the records and we 
compare the records and what actually happened.  Except for the cash, everything else 
had to be controlled.  
 
So, the payment regimes and the protocols required numerous signatures for 
sign off and request forwarded by myself would require no less than two other 
signatories, as well as those of the chief accountant and that. 
 
Now, Chair what is very important for me to note is that I was never allowed 
10 
to attend a meeting with anybody with the exception of Patrick Gillingham and Neil 
Radhakrishna and Gavin Watson, without having a director with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that the position throughout your time at Bosasa or only from a 
certain to a certain time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it has been the position from day one at Bosasa and I will 
tell you why.  Gavin Watson said:  You have to be like disciples.  Christ sent them out in 
two’s.  So, if one falls the other one picks them up.  I can show you documentation on 
their website, if it is still up, on that.   
That he always wanted two people to attend a meeting.  Except if it was a 
sensitive meeting like with Patrick Gillingham where one person would handle him, but 
20 
in every single meeting there had to be somebody with me. 
 
So, there was no possibility I could bribe somebody.  Unless, somebody can 
come to the commission and say I was with Angelo when Angelo physically bribed 
somebody and convinced them to do untoward things. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 176 of 191 
 
 
But the fact of the matter is, even with normal clients and negotiations, even 
if it is just a simple negation, I would always have to take a director with me or director  
and other people with me as well. 
 
So, I was never permitted to meet anybody alone.  I was also only allowed to 
meet Patrick Gillingham alone, because he was a sensitive case and even with 
Richmond Mti, I was not allowed to meet him alone.  Unless, Gavin 
Watson had said I may meet with him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just pause there, if you will for a moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have just said to the Chair that there was 
10 
no possibility that you could bribe anyone. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I presume what you really mean is that you 
could not go off on a frolic of your own and yourself make a decision to bride someone. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is something different from saying you 
participated knowingly and willingly. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not one but many schemes of bribery within 
the framework which you have described to the chair. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  And the reason why I am telling this Chair is 
because, yes, I was involved with all of it.  I have never disputed it.  I do not discount it 
whatsoever.   
You know, but what I am trying to explain to you is that, the mastermind is 
not myself behind it.  There are other people behind it that needs to be investigated and 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 177 of 191 
 
I think that is what I – what Advocate Pretorius is saying, is one hundred percent 
correct. 
 
For instance, I had to met with Patrick Gillingham I would literally have to 
debrief – it would take me the whole trip from Pretoria or Midrand back to Krugersdorp 
to debrief Gavin Watson on what exactly what had transpired in the meeting. 
 
So, it was a very controlling type environment and it was the same type of 
rule that everybody in the company had to apply.  I was mandated by a resolution to 
sign audited statements, cheques, EFT’s and payment requests.  That is in the 
company records, but I was not allowed to do this on my own and it would require at 
least a second signature which had to be a director of Gavin Watson himself. 
10 
 
You must understand.  Gavin Watson did not sign anything.  He is very 
clever there.  He never signed a thing.  At no stage did I have any permission to draw 
cash or make payments.  These decision had always been made by Gavin Watson or 
an appropriate director, if it had been approved by Gavin. 
 
So, even if a director came to me and said, you know, I need to book a 
vehicle for the weekend because Mr Joe X is coming to visit and I want to entertain 
him.  No, it still had to be approved.  And every one of the directors will tell you that. 
 
It always had to be approved by Gavin Watson who would always make the 
final decision to the extent that I could make operational decisions.  
I was not allowed or permitted to hire staff, making commitments or dismiss 
20 
without directors’ express permission and the approval of the human resources 
department.  Those rules were there.  I had to stick by them.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay, before you go on.  Evidence was given 
by Mr Venter yesterday that a Mr Reicher was employed within a Concilium, I think. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 178 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that he was related to you.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who employed him? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mr Reicher was employed by Mr Gavin Watson.  Gavin 
Watson interviewed Mr Reicher in my office.  He wanted a…  We had a major problem 
in one of the subsidiary companies where we had the young bulls fighting with each 
other.   
 
So, he asked me to find somebody that had engineering background and 
would be able to attend to the staff and deal wit them.  But also more importantly, we 
were concerned that we were losing money on procurement of technical equipment, 
10 
because we did not have technical people doing the technical procurement. 
 
So, Gavin Watson….  Doc Smith, actually and myself….  I just brought 
Giancarlo to the table.  He is actually – he is about 82-years-old.  At the time he was 
about 75 and I felt that he could add value because he had worked for ABI and he had 
worked for Husky Refrigeration and I felt that he could add value. 
 
The reason…  He was retired.  He did not need to work.  He was actually 
doing me a favour.  So, the reason I brought him onboard is because of that.  I 
suggested that Doc Smith look at his CV which he did.  Doc Smith and Gavin Watson 
actually employed Peter Reicher.   
 
There were…  I will tell you know exactly who were family members of mine.  
20 
There was a Charles Macbeth.  Charles Macbeth was in charge of security.  Gavin 
Watson interviewed him.  He was placed on Consilium’s payroll by Doc Smith and he 
ran the security operations for ACSA.  He was also employed because of his 
knowledge in property and he was utilised to manage and oversee the regional offices 
in the various areas, okay. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 179 of 191 
 
 
There was…  Oh, yes.  There was a youngster that was employed by the 
name of Shane Petersen who was somehow related to me.  I do not even know how, 
but Shane Petersen was employed.  I asked him to resign.  He actually – I suggested 
he resign in 2016.   
He was responsible for putting business intelligence into the company, in 
terms of software solutions that he developed for me, to be able to give me one entry 
point on an iPad where I could see the performance of the company. 
 
Shane Petersen then left.  He got a job where he now heads of one of the 
major companies, FMCG companies in South Africa.  At any one time, I could not 
employ anybody and I would make sure that the did not report directly to myself. 
10 
 
Whoever had been employed, for instance, Peter Reicher would report to 
Ishmael Treavor Mncwaba who was one of the directors.  Not directly to me.  
Charles Macbeth reported directly to Joe Gumede.  I do not see the issue there. 
 
As a matter of fact, Gavin advocated employing family members.  We have, 
it must be 30 family and wife – husband and wife family teams of people working at the 
company.  So, I do not know what the issue would have been there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  23.9.  You make mention of further 
limitations on your powers. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I could not appoint suppliers or chain supplies on my own.  
That was a no, no.  Because, Chair if I am working with Ishmael Trevor Mncwaba 
20 
and Fezile Mzazi.  The are running Sondolo IT.  So, I can only offer advice.  I am a 
support structure to them.   
 
Yes, I do manage them in terms of budgets and in terms of bottom line 
profits.  That was my function.  I had to make sure that they delivered and operationally 
that they made a success out of it and they made profits. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 180 of 191 
 
 
So, I cannot dictate to them who they should employ or which suppliers they 
should use.  So, if they for instance said to me they want to use Daewoo or they would 
like to use Bosch or they would like to use Samsung.  If they put a business case for 
that, I cannot just go in and change it. 
There is a proper business case for that and there was no ways I could walk 
in and say:  Oh, well.  We are changing the bread supplier today.  The bread supplier.  
We do not like Albany anymore.  We prefer using Tiger or…  I must not use bread 
names, but all right.  Some other company.  I could not make that decision because it 
would impact on operational.  We were dealing with people.  
If you made one change in correctional centres you could cause a riot.  If you 
10 
change the supplier of mealie meal.  If you did not supply Mr Uys mealie meal you had 
a problem.  So, you could not make those decisions without having consulted with the 
actual individual director concerned.  So, those were the limitations I had and I had to 
work within them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Legal matters. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Legal matters.  There was a legal preference.  Let us put it 
that way.  I tried to utilise two or three different attorney firms, but ultimately Gavin 
would make the decision and it was based on who would be loyal to the family for long 
enough. 
 
So, for instance in Port Elizabeth, sometimes he would use…  I do not want 
20 
to mention names.  I do not think I should.  Advocate Pretorius, may I? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Must I mention names? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not my decision. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, then I...[intervenes] 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 181 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If it is necessary. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, but for instance there were certain attorneys that were 
loyal to the Watson family.  So, they would use them and that is how it worked.  I could 
not decide:  Well, I would like to use Sonnenberg, because their coffee is really great 
and they have got the best pens when you can take with you when you finished with 
them.  No, not at all.  I would be told:  You will use this attorney and this is what they 
are good at. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, you mentioned attorneys names. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to particulars incidents. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Did I?  Sorry/ 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not necessary to repeat them again, but if 
you want to I am not going to stop you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, my understanding was, he was just mentioning a name not 
because there was a particular incident. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, your evidence is and has been 
throughout that certain firms of attorney were used. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They are already on record.  So, there is no 
20 
problem in mentioning them again. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, it was – Bryan B Buck was used.  He was a personal 
friend and I mean he was involved with the Watsons for many, many years.  Graham 
Richards was another one that Gavin used in Port Elizabeth.   
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 182 of 191 
 
There is one attorney I brought to the table, but he got used once or twice 
and then he was hijacked and Gavin Watson wanted his son to get involved with him.  
So, you know, it was very regimental.  You had parameters in which you could work and 
you could not make decisions out of those parameters. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  All right, and then 23.11. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  23.11 is very clear, Chair in that every single dealing in that 
company in terms of corrupt activities including payments for tenders, gratuities, 
absolutely everything was done verbally and you would just told to get on and do it and 
it was approved by Gavin. 
 
He would not write anything down.  He never had a secretary.  He always 
10 
went around jokingly saying:  I do not have a secretary.  I do not have email or did have 
an email and that was it.  I mean, you had to do all the work and sign everything and he 
would walk away scot-free. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If I understand you correctly.  The point you are 
making there is that not that others were not involved in corrupt activities in one form or 
another, but that there is no basis for saying that everything happened without Gavin 
Watson’s involvement.  There is no basis for saying that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, there is no basis for saying that.  Gavin Watson knew 
about absolutely everything. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then 23.12. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, that is…  I was instructed…  I had to provide a support 
service to the directors who would come to me with requests that were to be made.  I 
would then approach Gavin.  I was the intermediary at times where if Ishmail needed a 
new set of tyres on his car.   
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 183 of 191 
 
He would have to come to me.  Speak to me about the tyres and I would 
have to go and negotiate with Gavin on Ishmail’s behalf.  Nine out of ten times, myself 
and Gavin had a discussion over the phone and he say:  No, I am peed-off with Ishmail 
this month.  Let him wait another month with his tyres.   
But if Ishmail wanted a bride for a certain individual that was critical then 
Ishmail would go to Gavin or to myself and he would start debating it and then I would 
be pulled into the conversations.  Sometimes.  Sometimes I was never pulled into the 
conversations and these things just happened on their own. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 24, you wish to deal with a 
topic that we have already dealt with.   
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I do not know if it is necessary to go there 
again, but if you wish to, you may. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it is important because for the record I just wanted to 
place it on 24 and once more, I do not want to absolve myself of any guilty.  I think the 
Chair knows me from the first day I arrived here, I was very open about it. 
 
During the time I was employed I knew that there were politically connections 
with Gavin Watson and the directors and that they were being awarded tenders.  I knew 
something was happening.  The detail maybe I did not know, but I was aware that there 
were gratifications that were being to relevant people. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Gratifications being bribes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Bribes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is gratification.  You give me this.  I will give you that.  It is a 
bribe.  So, I knew that this was happening and…  But until I became personally 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 184 of 191 
 
involved, all right, when these cash payments were made and handed over, as well as 
other gratifications, like cars, the flights, the hotel stay, the holidays… 
 
The precise detail of the other payments, I did not know the exact amounts 
and that is why one was in a position where you could not really go and sniff too much 
because then you really get involved and then you are in trouble and as many a times 
people were dismissed just because they asked the wrong question. 
 
My role, right in the beginning and I am talking the period 2002, 2003, 2004 
was limited to drafting the specifications for correctional services.  I, however, became 
aware of the corruptive activities when the matters started to come out in the press and 
they were ventilated in the press and then more so, the shock came in 2009 when I 
10 
actually got a report of the SIU and when we started cleaning up, I picked up more stuff 
that the SIU had not picked up on yet or had not been found out yet and it just started 
getting worse, and worse and worse. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you have already conceded, I think fairly, 
that even before 2006 you were aware generally of corrupt activities. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  I knew there was corrupt activities but the detail I did not 
know.  I will never forget, Chair.  I was on my way to on holiday with my family at O.R. 
Tambo.  It was 07:30 in the morning.  I was catching a flight out and I was in the 
international section and I was laying on one of these waterbeds getting a beautiful 
massage with these machines that close up on you. 
20 
 
And I was in there and I was really relaxed and I got a phone call from Cape 
Town to say:  Have you seen the newspaper.  And I said:  No, I have not seen the 
newspaper.  And if you refer to Annexure...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  JJ. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 185 of 191 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  JJ.  That was the very first report that Adriaan Basson and 
Karien du Plessis, I think.  Ja, Karien du Plessis was involved. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At page 115? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  I just want to get to it.  Sorry.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where the headlines reads: Linde ontken 
belange bots and bykontrakte. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When that contract came out and I was shocked because I did 
not know about the ...[indistinct] investments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was published on 31 March 2006. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Die Burger. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then there was a...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So, you say this was the first newspaper article that you are aware of 
that came up with some of the things about Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This opened up the Sondolo linked with ...[indistinct] 
investments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it was…  We did not even know about Leonora.  I did not 
20 
know about Leonora.  So, what I am trying to say, Chair is, I knew that there were 
things going on.  This article opened my eyes to there is something funny.  But when 
we started questioning it, he(?) said:  There is nothing.  Do not worry.  Do not worry.  
You know.  So, that was the eye opener. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 186 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, but notwithstanding your eyes being 
opened.  They already had been opened to a degree but not to detail.  You continued 
with your activities after 2006? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja, all right.  25, you have dealt with already.  
Perhaps you should deal with the – I presume you regard them as important allegations 
and I do appear to be important.  From paragraph 26 onwards. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, from 25…  Well, you know, and I have asked the 
investigators to call certain people that were there when they did the agreements and 
all that type of things, because I was not there and I do not know what agreements 
10 
were made, but I have given them the detail, Chair. 
 
At this stage, I would like to add as well that I have done my utmost to assist 
to commission and possible the Hawks, but I am not looking for any clemency or 
anything like that.  This is not only included in the confirmation of additional facts 
relating to the SIU report or the Department of Correctional Services. 
 
So, the SIU report is good in one sense, but it does not cover everything.  
What I am trying to explain is that we have tried everything possible to bring to state 
capture a classic example of what state capture has become and what state capture is 
and how it destroyed the fabric of our morality and that. 
 
But I am also in a constant battle to persuade further whistle blowers within 
20 
the group and I am sure Chair you have seen the articles of people being frog-march 
out of the office building with high heavy handguns and that type of thing.  So, it is a 
constant battle, but I think we have seen results.  We have seen people come forward. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, perhaps if you are going to raise that 
incident, you should deal with it in a little more detail and not just in passing.  It relates 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 187 of 191 
 
to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Whistle blowers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It relates to…  well, they are not necessarily 
whistle blowers but the frog-marching out of the premises.  I do not want you to reveal 
names or capacities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have not have the recollection of seeing any other article about 
frog-marching, but maybe one of the witnesses may have mentioned frog-marching. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, Chair in order for me to unpack this whole process, what 
was necessary for me was to be able to get information that substantiated the claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So, the only way I could get information was if I had people 
within the group that would filter me information out that are required. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It sounds bad.  It sounds like espionage and it is been termed 
as extortion and everything, but in actual fact, it is because I am fed up of the level of 
corruption.  The fact is, I would utilise certain…  Not utilise people but people would 
offer information to me.   
 
I never ever threatened anybody for information, but people would come 
voluntarily.  There was an incident that occurred – just to give you a sample of what 
happened at this very same company – was an incident occurred where they tried to 
20 
liquidate the company quickly and obviously, if you liquidate a company, you cover up 
all your tracks. 
 
So, immediately they realised that I was starting to unpack this from the last 
state capture and they post it for liquidation.  Voluntary liquidation.  Is that what you 
want me to go into and explain? 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 188 of 191 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, there will be further investigations.  It is 
just that it maybe that the Chair is interest in your comment about people being frog-
marched from the company’s premises. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well, anybody in short, in summary.  Anybody thought to be 
given any information out to myself have been accosted by and removed from the 
company and just suspended by having… 
 
I mean that have old…  These are old ladies.  Not old ladies, but they are 
ladies and some young men.  They would have armed guards with R1-rifles arrive 
there.  Two or three of them and then take the person and make it visible, so that 
everybody in the office park sees this happen in full view and embarrass them.  Why? 
10 
To prevent anybody else from whistle blowing.  That is what was done. 
 
There was an article in one of the… I think it is News24 where actually has 
pictures of this happening as well and that is perpetual fight that we have, trying to get 
people to help whistle blow on this type of corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I assume that you have shared either with the investigators or 
the legal team such information relating to such persons as you know. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   The matters are being dealt with, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They all say allegations which at the moment, 
20 
as far as the investigators and the legal team are concerned, are allegations but 
allegations of some concern that at the time of the liquidation and particularly when 
documents were returned from the liquidators to Bosasa’s offices, documents were 
destroyed.  Do you know anything about that/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do.  It was reported to me.  I reported to the liquidators 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 189 of 191 
 
as well and I think there is a process which the investigators are busy with, 
investigating the documents. 
Especially relating to Bosasa’s supply chain management, have been 
removed and destroyed and various other documents being destroyed as well and even 
at specific places.  But I have given all that data to the investigators.   
So, the problem we have, Chair is that we want to get this thing sorted out 
and we want to clean up and we need to open it up.  As our president said, we have to.  
It is going to be hurtful and it is going to hurt and it is going to taste bad, but we better 
take the medicine, so that we can get the country back to where it should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I am sure I will at some stage get progress as to what is 
10 
happening about those...[intervenes]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  I did not get that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying, I am sure I am going to get progress reports at some 
stage about the matters that are being investigated in due course. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, you will, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Thank you.  I have always thought that my voice is very 
audible, but today maybe, I am speaking quite softly.  I think it is the second time that 
you do not hear.  Maybe I am speaking too softly today. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, sometimes I do not.  But sometimes, 
especially when one moves away from the microphone the voice drops. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is an ideal space between mouth and 
mic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, it is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us then move on.  Perhaps, if I can 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 190 of 191 
 
persuade the Chair to the last topic for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I realised that you did not want to review the time at half past 
four, but I allowed you because I was...[intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, I thought my bargaining position would be 
stronger if I raise the issue at quarter to four or quarter to five, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughter].  No, I happy that we stop now if you would prefer that.  I 
have in the meantime, I remembered that you have been standing there the whole day. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, it is just that we have work over the road to 
10 
continue with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No, no.  That is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So, I would be grateful if we could adjourn at 
this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and then tomorrow have you got a suggestion about starting 
earlier than ten or not? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well, we are just over halfway through, but 
perhaps and we agree that we should finish this evidence.  We do have consultation 
arranged after hours tomorrow that need to be held. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So, it would be perhaps safer to start at 09:30 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 09:30, ja.  Would that be fine with our Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, I am in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No.  Thank you.  We will adjourn now and then tomorrow 
28 MARCH 2019 – DAY 75 
 
Page 191 of 191 
 
we will start at 08:30. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 29 MARCH 2019
