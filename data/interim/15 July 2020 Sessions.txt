PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 29 JUNE 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes are we ready to start? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair.  If I may just indicate… 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do I not have any papers here? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair that is because I was going to hand 
10 
them up to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They only came through as you will be 
aware last night. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Late – yes.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if I could just introduce what is 
happening this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The commission was scheduled to receive 
the evidence of Mr Majola this morning.  Chair you will recall 
20 
that Mr Majola was implicated in the evidence of Mr X which 
was received by the commission in the February hearing.   
Pursuant to that and in fact in February the schedule of 
witnesses anticipated that we would here from Mr Majola 
after Mr X’s evidence.  But on the eve of Mr Majola’s 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 4 of 26 
 
evidence in February we received an application for a 
postponement and that application was granted.  Today was 
the next scheduled date for Mr Majola’s evidence and late 
yesterday evening we received a second application for 
postponement.  Chair what we have prepared overnight for 
you is a copy of that application.  I must just explain all that 
came through to us yesterday was the Notice or Motion and 
founding affidavit excluding its annexures.  I understand 
from my learned friend and they will address this there was a 
difficulty with loadshedding and their ability to get the 
10 
annexures through yesterday evening.  They have brought 
copies this morning but the consequence of that is that you 
will get a file as you usually do with the Notice of Motion and 
affidavit but I have literally just had to insert the annexures 
in the back because those came through literally a few 
moment ago.  But if I may beg leave to hand that up and 
then to hand over to my learned friend to move the 
application if I may?  Chair this is my first time in the new 
venue and in the new world conditions and so I just would 
like to get your guidance.  Will my learned friend be 
20 
addressing you from where he is seated or would you prefer 
him to come to the podium? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I prefer them to come to the podium if – if 
– unless there is a particular issue but I think if they come to 
the podium there would need to be somebody who will come 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 5 of 26 
 
and wipe first.  If there is such a – such a person then I think 
there is – then that would be fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So we will ensure we sanitise it and then I 
will ask my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  To come up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV ROETS:  Good morning Chair I think I have already 
10 
greeted you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  But as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  As a courtesy gesture I just wish to say good 
morning again. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning, 
good 
morning, 
good 
morning. 
ADV ROETS:  May I begin Chair by stating that by way of 
introduction that I fell off the High Court steps some weeks 
20 
ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROETS:  And I injured by back rather severely to such 
an extent that I had to go for an MRI and later had to go for 
a lumber cerotomy a few weeks ago. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 6 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROETS:  So I am still as I am standing here… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it would be more convenient you can 
address me seated.  I did not know about that. 
ADV ROETS:  I will – I will beg your indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, No, no. 
ADV ROETS:  If I cannot stand anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By all means, by all means, yes. 
ADV ROETS:  It so happens perhaps it is Murphy’s Law that 
the gentleman who brought us to the venue also dropped us 
10 
about 500 metres and we had to walk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV ROETS:  And I limped here.  Fortunately, my instructing 
attorney … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  Carried my briefcase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  But we made any every effort to see to it that 
we comply with our obligations towards this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
ADV ROETS:  And see to it that we are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  So thank you for allowing me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  To address you on this as introduction. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 7 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no thank you. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And for maybe once you are back at your 
seat from where you think I think it would be more 
convenient for you to address me you could just for the sake 
of the record just place the names on record yourself – the 
instruction attorney and of course who you represent. 
ADV ROETS:  Indeed Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the record.  Ja. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you, thank you so much Chair.  In view 
10 
of what you said to me for record purposes I am Advocate 
Francois 
Roets 
Counsel 
representing 
Mr 
Majola 
on 
instructions of Sarlie and Ismail Incorporated from Bez 
Valley, Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you.  My Lord this is an application and 
we have filed a Notice of Motion.  I know my instructing 
attorney of record made concerted efforts to endeavour to 
see to it that the necessary papers with the supporting 
affidavits and annexures thereto are presented to all the 
20 
relevant parties as a matter of extreme urgency.  In fact late 
yesterday afternoon I incessantly tried to get hold him saying 
that I need the papers, I need the papers, I need the papers 
and I could not get through to him and I later around about 
six o’clock only got through to him and he had loadshedding 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 8 of 26 
 
and loadshedding brought about that he could not operate 
whatsoever and making calls and printing etcetera, etcetera 
that goes along with it.  And he also bumped his head.  But 
be that as it may this is an application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  To – to have the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ultimately choose to address me 
standing because I did allow you to be seated. 
ADV ROETS:  Yes thank you so much.  I will – I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ROETS:  Beg your indulgence to sit in the event that I 
cannot I cannot stand anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Alright thank you. 
ADV ROETS:  This is an indeed then, as I have said Mr 
Chair an application that the Chair considers that the matter 
that was enrolled for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ROETS:  In respect of Mr Majola be deferred and that it 
be entertained on a later occasion.  In the Notice of Motion 
which is supported by the affidavit of my instructing attorney 
20 
Mr Sarlie he comprehensively deals with the efforts that 
have been made to procure the necessary information from 
Mr Majola.  I think it is clear from reading of the papers and I 
will take you through it if you had not had the opportunity to 
read through it. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 9 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have had the opportunity to look at it.  Ms 
Hofmeyr was kind enough to make sure that after she 
received the Notice of Motion and affidavits last night. 
ADV ROETS:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She sent it through.  But you can obviously 
emphasise the important features of the application. 
ADV ROETS:  I think we can expect nothing less of her 
especially being who she is.  The – the affidavit highlights 
the fact that concerted efforts were made to get hold of Mr 
Majola.  Sorry may I just interpolate at this stage and see I 
10 
have got a bottle with me and no glasses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  May I drink from the bottle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes that is fine, that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV ROETS:  And despite Mr Sarlie having drafted whatever 
he could on what he had on the occasions that he could have 
spoken to Mr Majola it still appears that Doctor Pillay holds 
the view that Mr Majola is not well and perhaps it is 
Murphey’s Law the doctor himself – a psychiatrist attracted 
Covid-19 and was indisposed himself for a number of days.  
20 
So we were at pains to see to it that we are right and ready.  
We are fully aware of the importance of this commission 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you might… 
ADV ROETS:  And what the court has to do. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 10 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to put your bottle where it 
is flat ja.   
ADV ROETS:  And what the commission and what the Chair 
has 
to 
decide 
and 
the 
barrage 
and 
the 
plethora 
of 
information that you have to receive and you cannot 
succumb to the whims of – of legal representatives or clients 
who are not seriously – who try and play games or do not 
really want to be serious in their presentation or not of their 
evidence.   
 
But I submit that it is clear firstly that we are not in a 
10 
position despite concerted efforts to – to present to this 
commission and to you Chair the comprehensive affidavit 
which entails all that we have to say and in answer to the 
evidence that we received.  But we can only do so if we are 
content and you know much better than I do that we always 
have to act in the best interest of our client. 
 
That we have to have the okay of the psychiatrist 
stating that Mr Majola is in such a position of health that he 
is able to elude to and advance a sensible, a well informed 
and a proper statement and facts to us with a view to 
20 
enabling us as a matter of extreme urgency to present the 
documentation we are obliged to do and we intend to do. 
 
So on that score I will pray that you consider 
postponing this applica – the matter today to a date suitable 
to – to you Chair. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 11 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you.  The – the matter that is of 
some concern to me which I think you would have suspected 
would be of concern to me is that I think it is the ad time if I 
am not mistaken when the commission has fixed a date for 
Mr Majola to come and appear and he – he is unable to do 
so and it would seem if I read the papers correctly it would 
seem that – it seems to always happen just before the 
hearing – the date of his appearance. 
ADV ROETS:  Ys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may be misreading something but that is 
10 
the impression I get and that is a little bit of concern to me. 
ADV ROETS:  I understand that Chair.  I in fact not only as a 
member of the High Court but as Counsel appearing 
specifically dealt with this and with Mr Sarlie and I told him 
that under no circumstances must the impression be created 
that we are engaging delaying tactics or every time just 
before he has to testify there is some or other reason for him 
not to – to decide what to do. 
 
As I say – as I understand we do not need to file an 
affidavit beforehand but we will indeed consider doing so.  
20 
But I am sure that you can rest assured that we have made it 
abundantly clear and I am sure Mr – Mr Sarlie took much 
effort in alerting all parties that this will not be tolerated 
especially by this commission and I under the circumstances 
I am bound by the instructions that I have. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 12 of 26 
 
 
I also initially when I read these papers had the same 
thoughts that you had and the last thing ever is that I want 
the Chair to ever get the impression that we are playing 
games or embarking in delaying tactics or whatsoever.  We 
know it is extremely expensive to have this commission sit.  
We have the Depute Chief Justice chairing and we have no 
obligations first and foremost our allegiance is towards you 
Mr Chair and then towards our client. 
 
So we will do everything and I give you this as an 
undertaking as Counsel that we will do everything in our – 
10 
which is possible to ensure that we as a matter of extreme 
urgency obtain the – the information that we need.  Take a 
well-informed decision and advise the parties accordingly. 
 
But I am unfortunately bound by the documents that I 
have.  I think my subject of belief whether it is right or wrong 
is irrelevant.  I am bound by this and I share your concern in 
this regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I will hear what Ms 
Hofmeyr has to say.  I – I am encouraged by the assurance 
you have given me as Counsel. 
20 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you will do everything in your power 
together with your instructing attorney. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you so much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To make 
sure that there is 
proper 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 13 of 26 
 
cooperation from Mr Majola. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you know you know the role of 
Counsel and attorneys in matters such as this can go a long 
way. 
ADV ROETS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
To 
ensuring 
that 
there 
is 
proper 
cooperation from Clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My Lord for what – ag Chair for what it is 
worth in all the years of practice and I have been practicing 
10 
for many, many years I have had the privilege of being on 
the bench myself for ten years as a Regional Magistrate and 
I do not think it can ever, ever be said that I ever 
deliberately or delayed any procedure whatsoever.  I believe 
in that justice must be done, it must be done swift and we 
must get over with.  Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no thank you very much.  Thank you. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV ROETS:  I profusely apologise. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  There was one aspect that slipped my mind 
and that is I will beg the indulgence of the Chair direct that 
his medical condition that of Mr Majola be kept confidential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 14 of 26 
 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair as you indicated in your exchange 
with my learned friend Mr Roets this is Mr Majola’s second 
formal postponement application.  The first was received in 
February on the eve of his evidence.  The second is the one 
moved today again received on the eve of his evidence.  And 
between those two applications when he was scheduled to 
10 
attend in May when we were unduly optimistic that the 
commission might be able to convene then we also received 
confirmation that in advance of that evidence scheduling he 
had again been admitted to hospital and was unavailable.   
So Chair your recollection that on three occasions 
anticipated evidence giving by Mr Majola at this commission 
has been preceded 
by admissions to 
hospital is not 
incorrect.  Those are the facts.  That is what we sit with 
today as you consider this application. 
Chair that is an unfortunate state of affairs I submit 
20 
because the evidence of Mr X who did give evidence and 
testified before this commission implicated Mr Majola in 
large scale looting of public funds while he was program 
manager at the Mhlathuze Water Board.   
According to Mr X’s evidence Mr Majola coordinated 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 15 of 26 
 
this scheme of looting and he involved various established 
engineering firms in that scheme and it was a scheme in 
which Mr X was a participant by his own admission. 
The scheme Chair took money from the public purse 
that was intended for important projects – water projects in 
the area and diverted it to private hands.   
Chair Mr X’s allegations against Mr Majola are very 
serious and if true they indicate nothing less than criminal 
conduct on the part of Mr Majola.   
There is I therefore submit an intense public interest 
10 
in this commission receiving the version of Mr Majola in 
response to Mr X   
Mr Majola has been repeatedly invited since Mr X’s 
evidence in February to provide this commission with his 
version on affidavit.  Despite those numerous invitations and 
the almost five months since Mr X’s evidence no affidavit has 
been forthcoming. 
Chair it is not the case that in that five month period 
at least from the facts that are disclosed in the affidavit that 
Mr Majola has been indisposed or in hospital.  He has been 
20 
for periods as we understand the facts but not consistently 
for that period. 
And although some effort has been made in the 
affidavit before you to describe the efforts that his legal 
team has taken to prepare that affidavit it is so that lawyers 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 16 of 26 
 
all around the country under Covid circumstances and 
otherwise have managed to take instructions from clients, to 
prepare affidavits, to convene virtual meetings and indeed to 
run cases before courts. 
 
It is therefore in our submission inexplicable in fact 
how the commission could be almost five months from the 
evidence of Mr X and not have Mr Majola’s version even on 
affidavit before it.   
 
Chair in the light of those – that situation it is our 
submission that the postponement application should be 
10 
addressed in the following terms. 
 
Chair we submit first that as a practical matter Mr 
Majola is not present today.  As a practical matter we simply 
cannot proceed with his evidence.  He remains in Durban as 
I understand it waiting for a bed at a hospital at which he 
has been admitted by his physician. 
 
Here is as a consequence no way in which we can 
practically proceed today and so to the extent that that is not 
feasible we submit the application should be granted. 
 
But Chair we would like to submit to you that it 
20 
should not be granted without something more.  And the 
something more Chair is that we stipulate and you in your 
ruling do so the requirement that Mr Majola does provide his 
affidavit, his version to this commission 
 
I propose a reasonable amount of time.  I do not have 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 17 of 26 
 
a sense of the details but something of the order of four 
weeks I was going to submit to you might be reasonable.  On 
my count that would take us to the 12 August 2020. 
 
Chair my learned friend in his submissions to you 
earlier said he understood that affidavits were voluntary not 
necessarily compelled.  Well of course Chair you have the 
power and the regulations to issue a directive – a 10/6 
directive which not only makes it obligatory to provide an 
affidavit but the person who fails to provide the affidavit now 
because of the amendment to the regs commits a criminal 
10 
offence in fact. 
 
We submit in any ruling you give today you should 
simply stipulate that the affidavit is required.  That it should 
deal in details and comprehensively with the evidence of Mr 
X 
both 
in 
the 
affidavit 
version 
he 
presented 
to 
the 
commission but also the transcripts of his oral evidence and 
that that should be provided I submit a reasonable time 
might be in the order of four weeks. 
 
And Chair once the commission has received that 
affidavit of course it can be considered and further steps can 
20 
be 
taken 
including 
summonsing 
Mr 
Majola 
if 
that 
is 
necessary. 
 
Chair those are our submissions in relation to the 
application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there – are there specific questions 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 18 of 26 
 
that have been even to Mr Majola to address in an affidavit 
form? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair there were in advance of Mr X’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because there were engagements with Mr 
Majola and Mr X in advance of the February evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At that point Mr Majola refused to engage 
with the commission and did not provide answers to those 
10 
questions. 
 
Since 
Mr 
X’s 
evidence 
itself 
and 
his 
comprehensive affidavit there has not been a follow up with 
additional questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But that is something that we could 
certainly facilitate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am thinking that Counsel here and 
his instructing attorney would probably make it very clear to 
Mr Majola that he should provide an affidavit and should 
answer those questions. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I believe that they would play that role.  
So I – I would be inclined to include in the order an order 
that he should furnish an affidavit giving his version and 
specifically answering the questions that have been put to 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 19 of 26 
 
him by a certain date.   
 
As you stand there are you satisfied that those 
questions that has – were previously sent to him are still fine 
there is no need for any amendments because obviously he 
has possession of those and – so I can just make an order 
that – that – those questions are still valid so to speak. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair let me – let me correct one aspect? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We – we never actually sent questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Per se. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
So 
it 
would 
just 
be 
around 
characterisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Its topics ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Its topics indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is topics ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So from the first engagement the general 
topics have been canvassed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to say give your version on these 
20 
topics. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On these events or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Events or topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is good enough. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 20 of 26 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is good enough. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Having said that though that happened 
early on in the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And certainly, by the time of Mr X’s 
evidence Mr X’s account of events had filled out quite 
substantially. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There was not then a further return to Mr 
10 
Majola to say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well now there is a fuller version because 
the fuller version then came in Mr X’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And in his testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So as I stand here today, I would suggest 
the original topics remain valid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But what is most critical is that the 
affidavit that is produced by Mr Majola addresses all the 
respects in which Ms X’s evidence implicates him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Refers to him.  He can give whatever 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 21 of 26 
 
background and context he needs to give. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  His version fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But the focus I submit should be on Mr X’s 
evidence 
because 
that 
is 
the 
latest 
iteration 
of 
the 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And would offer Mr Majola I submit the – 
the fullest opportunity to make sure that nothing is left 
10 
unanswered in this latest version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And does he have the transcript of Mr X’s 
evidence or does he only have the affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He certainly has the affidavit. The 
transcripts is available on the website. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the website.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So it is just a matter of a click and I would 
be happy to provide the link later today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  To my learned friend. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Counsel you can address me 
from there if – if you wish but if you want to go to the – to 
the podium that is fine. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 22 of 26 
 
ADV ROETS:  Mr Chair I totally align myself with the 
submissions advanced by my learned friend behind me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr yes. 
ADV ROETS:  And the court at the risk of being repetitive 
repeat that we will do our utmost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  And see to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  That those questions be answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ROETS:  In the fullest extent that we are able to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  And moreover, I just want to place on record 
that my instructing attorney advised me that he has in fact 
received the evidence of Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the affidavit. 
ADV ROETS:  The affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, no the transcript. 
ADV ROETS:  The evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The transcript. 
20 
ADV ROETS:  The transcripts of the evidence of Mr X. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes oh that is good ja. 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is good.  In terms of timeframe for the 
affidavit I think the doctor said he might be in hospital that is 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 23 of 26 
 
Mr Majola might be in hospital for a few weeks or what or 
two weeks in terms of the timeframe for the filing of that 
affidavit?  What do you – I mean obviously Mr – Mr X has 
had ample time in the past five months to do so but while he 
is in hospital, he cannot do anything. 
ADV ROETS:  Chair we will have to get the guidance of 
course of the doctor who treats him but we will truly tell the 
doctor how urgent this matter is and what your sentiments 
are in this regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
ADV ROETS:  And there is no time to be wasted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  Even if we have to burn the candle at both 
ends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ROETS:  So... 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe I could – we could look at the 15 
August I do not know what day of the week it is? 
ADV ROETS:  15 August – 15 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On or before 15 August and if for some 
20 
reason through unforeseen circumstances there is a real 
difficulty then you can apply for an extension but obviously 
you understand very clearly what my … 
ADV ROETS:  Your attitude is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 24 of 26 
 
ADV ROETS:  Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you very much.  Thank you 
very much.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair just one point of 
correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Might have been my inaudibility with the 
mask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But the 15 August is in fact a Saturday so I 
10 
think the four weeks… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think it is your fault I think you 
said 12. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but I – but I thought we are on 15 July. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes so we just added the month to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So one month 15 t h ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Exactly.  Well Chair the 12t h is the 
Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  After which is exactly four weeks from 
today but if we were to make it the Friday the 14t h it is flimsy 
material to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think… think… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Just the 15t h is a Saturday. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232 
 
Page 25 of 26 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually 30 days would expire on the 14t h. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The application for the postponement of Mr 
Majola’s – or  
10 
1. The postponement of the hearing of Mr Majola’s 
evidence is postponed sine adhere. 
2. Mr Majola is directed to deliver an affidavit on or before 
the 14 August 2020 in which he deals with the topics 
that have previously been furnished to him and gives 
his full version on those topics with regard to the 
evidence given by Mr X before this commission earlier 
this year. 
I think this – that covers everything I think. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you very much and thank you 
to 
Counsel 
and 
his 
instructing 
attorney 
for 
their 
determination to try and make sure that Mr Majola will 
cooperate in making sure that we – we do not have these 
further postponements in the future if at all possible. 
15 JULY 2020 – DAY 232
