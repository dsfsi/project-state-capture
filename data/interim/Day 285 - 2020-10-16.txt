PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 16 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mkwanazi.  Thank you 
for coming back to the commission even though virtually 
but I think you are not testifying for the first time. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Thank you Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Thank you.  Okay Mr Myburgh.  Yes 
thank you Chairperson.  As you know our next witness is 
Mr Mkwanazi he is going to be giving evidence via Zoom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just one second Mr Myburgh.  Where 
is this – that other light that is usually there? I think there 
would be two.  I do not know I see it is a little dark but 
maybe I should not be concerned about it.  But – ja well 
the technicians – the people who – who deal with it know 
what I am talking about.  I think they will attend to it.  Okay 
Mr Myburgh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson as you know Mr 
Mkwanazi is going to give evidence by way of Zoom by 
agreement with the parties and with your direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps he could be sworn in as a 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 4 of 247 
 
witness and then I will take him to his affidavit and that 
can then be admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I have been asked to enquire whether 
you happy with the arrangements? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am happy with the arrangement I 
am just realising that you will be looking there – I will be – 
I wonder whether it was not possible to have this 
somewhere there where we could both see him.  But it is 
not a big deal if you … 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We have tried that there was really 
organised chaos before you arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson I think this is probably 
the best that we can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us stick to this so long ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And so if I might just mention I think 
there is absence of lighting.  The lighting has been moved 
to my left so that it does not shine directly in my face so 
that I can look at the screen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So it might appear slightly darker to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.   
ADV MKHWANAZI: If I may good morning Chair, good 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285

[inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes it is Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer? 
ADV MKHWANAZI:  Yes Chair [inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you very much.  I do not 
know what it is but when you speak it is not as clear as it 
ought to be.  I mention that so that when next time there is 
a need for you to speak hopefully whatever it is that may 
need to be attended to – will help being attended to. 
ADV MKWANAZI:  Okay.

MR MKWANAZI:  I can put it on Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think put it on if you do not mind. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 7 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Okay.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was wondering – I was wondering 
whether you took your jacket off because it was already hot 
there or whether it was antici – in anticipation of eats. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Mr Chairman I think anticipation of eats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you Chairperson.  Good 
morning Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Good morning Advocate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You would have been provided with a 
10 
bundle of documents I refer to as Bundle 4A. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I please ask you to turn to 
page 1 in that bundle? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Okay it is 4.  Okay is it written Exhibit 
BB18? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  On the 
20 
spine the first writing should be Transnet Bundle 04A.  Is 
that correct Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then below that it says Exhibit 
BB18.  Have you got the correct one Mr Mkwanazi? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 8 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I have got the one Exhibit BB18 and 
then on the second page it is an index BB18 then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no it is the right one. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Then on the next page it is a declaration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is the right one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Mkwanazi during the course of 
your testimony when I refer to page numbers I am referring 
to the black page numbers here on this page – page 3 on 
the left hand side, do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No I see that Advocate. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I would like just to start off by asking 
you to confirm.  Is this your declaration? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct Advocate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you could then please turn to the 
end of your declaration at page 20.   
MR MKWANAZI:  19, 20.  Yes I am at page 20. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And do you confirm that you signed 
this declaration on the 31 August this year? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I do confirm. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then I would ask you to confirm 
20 
attached to your affidavit where a series of annexures we 
have A, B and C – C was the KPMG report.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you then turn all the way to page – 
right at the end of the flag to page 21.412. Are you there? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 9 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not yet I am at 21.412 yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We received the annexures up to A, B 
and C we did not receive D and E. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so you confirm that Annexures 
A, B and C were annexures to your affidavit? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I will confirm yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Thank you.  Now Mr 
Mkwanazi if you could go back then please to page 3. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What I am going to do is I am going 
to lead you through your declaration. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And I am going to give you the 
opportunity of presenting the evidence that is set out here 
and after that I will have a series of questions for you and 
obviously the Chairperson would ask questions whenever 
he wishes to.  You follow the process. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay let us start off then with your 
20 
personal details at paragraph 1.   
MR MKWANAZI:  That is true. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Were you an Executive Director of 
Transnet from 1996 to 2001? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 10 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You were also a former Group Chief 
Executive Officer of Transnet and you held that position 
from 2001 to 2003? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then I suppose importantly for 
present purposes you say: 
“I am also the former Chairman of the board 
of Transnet having held that position for a 
period of four years from December 2010 to 
December 2014.” 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You say that you were furthermore 
the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nomination 
Committee as well as a member of the Acquisitions and 
Disposal Committee during your tenure on the board. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You then go on to say at paragraph 
4.1 that you were asked to provide this declaration 
essentially dealing with the decision to enter into a 
settlement with Mr Gama and reinstate him.  Is that 
20 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you were also asked to deal with 
the Terms of that settlement agreement? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 11 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Perhaps I could ask you then to pick 
up at paragraph 4.2 and verbalise what is contained there 
about your meeting with Minister Gigaba? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I think paragraph 4.2 confirms that I 
was approached by Minister Gigaba to join the board of 
Transnet sometime in December for a period of three years 
and also in that meeting with the – Mr Gigaba he indicated 
a few areas of concern.   
One of those was a lack of transformation as there 
were very few senior positions held by African women.  The 
10 
other she was under the impression that the procurement 
systems of Transnet was open to corruption by employees 
and other stakeholders.   
He emphasised that as the incoming Chair of the 
board this must an area of focus.  He also somehow was 
aware of problems in the procurement of suppliers and 
services for mega projects in Transnet. 
These 
would 
have 
included 
Durban 
Harbour 
Entrance widening, the Cape Town Container Terminal, the 
new multipurpose pipeline, the Ngqura Container Terminal, 
20 
the coal line expansion, the iron ore expansion and the 
appointment of [00:13:21] for engineering procurement 
construction and management and other feasibilities and 
one or the others done.   
He 
also 
was 
under 
the 
impression 
that 
the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 12 of 247 
 
disciplinary matter at Transnet were racially biased and 
that there was a condonation process at Transnet that was 
generally used to deal with divisions within Transnet.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  May I just ask you to confirm when 
did you hold this meeting with Minister Gigaba? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I think sometime in October.  I do not 
recall the date. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  October? 
MR MKWANAZI:  2010. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  2010? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  2010 yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright please carry on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is there a possibility that you 
might be mistaken with regard to the month and that the 
month might be November? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Sho I thought it was October it is a long 
time ago but I really thought it was October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reason I am raising that question is 
that in October 2010 Mr Gigaba was not Minister of Public 
Enterprises as yet it was still Ms Barbara Hogan.  And she 
20 
was dropped from cabinet on the 31 October 2010.  That is 
the evidence she gave.  And her – and Mr Gigaba’s 
appointment was announced – would have been announced 
probably on the 31 October or 1 November.  So he – he 
only 
became 
Minister 
of 
Public 
Enterprises 
from 
1 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 13 of 247 
 
November. So I am – I am wondering whether it might be 
October or whether it might be November? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman your observation is correct but 
my recollection it was sometime in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometime in October. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And – yes – and I am not sure if the 
Minister has put in his own affidavit.  Maybe I am wrong 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  It is a long time ago. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – he – well we have got an affidavit 
from him but I do not think it says anything about any date 
of your meeting. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I may be mistaken.  But of course – 
of course it is maybe possible that maybe if he had been 
informed 
already 
before 
the 
end 
of 
October 
maybe 
confidentially that he would be taking over.  Maybe he 
could start looking at matters that he thought they were 
urgent I am not sure.  But anyway your recollection is that 
20 
it was in October? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is my recollection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chairperson. 
 
Mr 
Mkwanazi then could you deal with the next heading please 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 14 of 247 
 
– Background to deviations in contracts at Transnet? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes Advocate unfortunately I have to 
read from this transcript. 
“Transnet 
has 
always 
had 
a 
detailed 
procurement procedure manual.  Even in 
1996 there 
would have been 
a tender 
manual and tender board that gets amended 
from 
time 
to 
time. 
 
These 
guide 
the 
organisation on how to procure goods and 
services from time to time.  Our board the 
10 
December 2010 – December 2014 board 
also amended the procurement procedure 
manual in 2011.  Transnet also has a 
delegation of authority frameworks for – 
that gets reviewed by a sub-committee and 
is approved by the Transnet board from 
time to time.  This delegation of authority 
framework defines the powers of the board, 
all 
sub-committees 
and 
executives 
generally up to the Group Chief Executive.  
20 
Then 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive 
has 
authority to sub-delegate to his or her 
executive 
committee. 
 
And 
these 
delegations of authority there are financial 
limits and other limits for all executives 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 15 of 247 
 
including 
the 
Transnet 
board. 
 
Some 
matters get elevated to the shareholder for 
approval 
following 
the 
guidelines 
in 
a 
shareholder compact.  In these financial 
limits 
executives 
can 
increase 
certain 
contract values by a defined percentage or 
not exceed contracts by a predetermined 
amount.  There are financial limits on 
appointment 
of 
consultants 
and 
other 
service 
providers. 
 
Should 
these 
be 
10 
exceeded during execution the responsible 
executive must report to his or her manager 
so that the issue can be referred back to 
the divisional or Transnet Acquisitioning 
Council or the Transnet board if it was the 
original 
approval. 
 
In 
most 
cases 
the 
Transnet internal audit gets involved to 
determine 
a 
fruitless 
and 
wasteful 
expenditure.  This is how deviations in 
contracts are identified.  The structure that 
20 
approved that contract must determine if 
the condonation is granted or not.  A line 
manager 
of 
the 
offender 
must 
take 
disciplinary action if warranted.” 
Can I continue? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 16 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes please.  So then in the next part 
of your declaration under heading 6 you deal with as you 
put it The history of deviations at Transnet.  And that runs 
through pages 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and then at 13 you 
deal with condonations at Transnet Freight Rail.  At 14 
Deviations in respect of mega projects and then one goes 
all the way to 17 before you then deal with Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What is it that you want to say about 
the history of deviations at Transnet? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  I will not read the submission line by line 
but in a nutshell the – there was a strange – it is not 
strange it is part of the PPM by the way which the 
Procurement Procedure 
Manual which does allow for 
certain deviations but they need to be approved further up 
and also it allows for condonations. 
 
So what I was trying to sketch here and by the way 
the things that I mentioned in my submission are events of 
from 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.  I indicate that 
there 
were 
many 
deviations. 
 
There 
were 
many 
20 
condonations and there is three that comes to mind 
because they were major. 
 
There is one on the appointment or the condonation 
of the VAE contract which somehow became irregular.  
Because when the approval was done I think it was done at 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 17 of 247 
 
R980 million and by the time it reached my office as an 
acting Group CEO to – to for condonation the amount was 
R1.778 million which is R1.8 billion roughly. 
 
Now – and funny enough that particular contract 
implicated a lot of people in some irregular behaviour.  In 
that those people various teams in TFR, in Group kept on 
trying to fix this problem and they delayed.  I do not know 
why it took so long for them to bring this thing up to the 
board for condonation. 
 
But eventually it came to the Transnet board 
10 
through my office for condonation and I then elevated the 
matter to the board and on elevating it I indicated that 
disciplinary action needs to be taken against – it was most 
probably plus or minus ten to twelve executives who had 
been involved in – some of it was worrisome.  It bordered 
on doing things without authority etcetera, etcetera. 
 
So 
yes 
it 
was 
brought 
to 
the 
board 
and 
a 
condonation was given by the board.  So that is a typical – 
but that is a big deviation.  And that is why it needed board 
approval. 
20 
 
Another one which comes to mind besides the VAE 
contract is the HMG contract which the executives – it 
started as a flow contract.  Then about a year and a half 
into a flow contract they then changed it to a – a HMG 
contract.  But the processes followed were flawed and 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 18 of 247 
 
therefore it became an irregular contract. 
 
And in executing that contract certain elements of 
that contract were implemented irregularly and there is 
some element of fruitless and wasteful expenditure in that 
contract. 
 
It came from a division called Transnet Capital 
Projects and the CEO was Ms Moira Moses.  And of course 
even this contract the HMG had to come through certain 
processes and be looked at and a condonation sort of 
required.  Although the project itself was far bigger it is 
10 
just the irregularity of it that required a condonation.  And 
in that process they – the Group CEO Brian Molefe was 
instructed to take disciplinary actions against not only Ms 
Moira Moses but maybe three to four other executives 
within Transnet Capital Projects. 
 
Then another big one which needed – now these 
condonations are now done in 2011 and yet these contracts 
were signed maybe in 2005/2006/2007. 
 
Another big one was in AWP Arab Wally Passes 
where for some reason they were also an engineering 
20 
procurement construction management service provider. 
 
The contract there increased from about R1.7 billion 
to over R3 billion and again the board sometime in 2011 
had to take a decision to condone and also specify that 
disciplinary action must be taken on those involved. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 19 of 247 
 
 
Now I just mentioned these three but there were 
others.  Not too many because I am focussing on the big 
ones.  Small ones in the KPMG report are mentioned in – I 
am not sure how many in total there were but yes others 
condonation was granted others condonation was not 
granted. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright could I perhaps just take you 
back to the beginning. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At paragraph 6.1 you say – this is at 
10 
page 6. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“On 22 December and in February 2011 – 
sorry 22 December 2010 and in February 
2011 the Public Protector made certain 
allegations 
about 
Transnet 
Procurement 
Procedures and the Gama matter.” 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
20 
“The new board appointed this JV of KPMG 
and Nkonki to investigate a number of 
issues around the procurement at Transnet 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
Public 
Protector 
allegations 
and 
Gama’s 
appeal 
on 
the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 20 of 247 
 
sanction of dismissal.” 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   
“The first report was done quickly on the 
information 
– 
as 
the 
information 
was 
historical.  It is that first report that was 
used by the board in its deliberations.  A 
law firm Norton Rose was consulted by 
Transnet and a different law firm Webber 
Wentzel was used by KPMG and Nkonki.  
10 
The final report was completed in November 
2011 as there was a lot of resistance from 
executives in cooperating with the KMPG 
and Nkonki team.” 
Would you confirm that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I would confirm that and maybe let 
me add something that is not clearly covered there.  There 
were a few board meetings that were – happened in 
January.  And I do not have minutes of those etcetera.  But 
already before the end of January Transnet at the time had 
20 
a funny environment where people were coming with 
allegations of this and the other.  So yes the matter that 
Nkonki covered even though the report was published – the 
final report was published in November.  The company 
knew already of some of these matters and I am also 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 21 of 247 
 
looking for that information because I did present some of 
that information to the board or a board sub-committee 
even before the end of January in terms of some of these.  
And funny enough some of these are not even mentioned 
even in the KPMG report.  But I am aware of them because 
I then forwarded typically there was one which I forwarded 
to the Group Chief Executive of an irregular consulting 
contract by – by the then Group General Manager.  And yes 
I still do not have the list of all consulting contracts that 
were entered into by – I still do not have it today.  But at 
10 
the time I was forwarded with what looked like an irregular 
contract and I handed it over to Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Mkwanazi what you then do at 
6.2 is you start listing the findings of the KPMG Nkonki 
report. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  As you say which was finalised in 
November 2011. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  And then over the page at 
20 
6.4 you deal with an internal audit report dated May 2011.  
Is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then I just wanted to make sure 
that I understand.  I mean it seems to me that by and large 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 22 of 247 
 
then the contents of this seven or eight pages is really 
taken from the KPMG report.  Is that – is that fair enough? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Hundred percent correct but having said 
that there were reports like – there was a report published 
called by Transnet internal audit.  It was called Transnet or 
TFR Procurement Irregularities I think it was done in 2008.  
I had seen that report.  But now when I ask for that report 
it is not available.  So the fact that I am using a November 
KPMG final report to me really is the fact that then KPMG 
had to go back and dig deeper of what happened as early 
10 
as 2005/06/07/08 and ’09.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then Mr Mkwanazi, just so 
that I confirm and understand your evidence.  You say:  
Look, there was smaller issues but you have identified.  And 
I suppose it is appropriate to look at the bigger issue.  But 
you have identified three main examples.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is the VAE contract if I understand 
you correctly. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, that is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The HMG contract. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was the third one? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think AWP, Alan Wally Parson. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   AWP contract. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 23 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is contract. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just ask you to confirm.  As I 
understand your evidence.  You say that condonation was 
granted 
in 
respect 
of 
all 
of 
those 
irregularities 
but 
disciplinary action was net instituted against the managers 
involved. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Wait, wait.  Condonation was granted on 
condition that the managers involved would be disciplined. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Now, when an HMG condonation was 
10 
granted, Brian Molefe was instructed to discipline Ms Mora 
Moses.  And I am not sure of the dynamics of those 
discussions but Ms Mora Moses immediately resigned. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just to ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Also ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just to summarise then.  In relation to 
20 
each of these three big contracts ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...VAE, HMG and AWP.  Condonation 
was 
granted 
on 
condition, 
as 
you 
have 
put 
it, 
that 
disciplinary action be taken against the relevant member. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 24 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But could I take you please to page 10 
of your affidavit?   
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let me direct your attention to 
paragraph 6.5 where you deal with the VAE contract. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at paragraph 6.5.1, the 
10 
second portion of it, you say: 
“The VAE contract of R 960 million in 2006, was 
subsequently increased to R 1.775 million... 
 
Or billion actually. 
“Condonation for contract extension and payments 
without a signed contract was only applied for in 
February 2011 and was granted by ME MKWANAZI 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
acting 
GCCO, 
subject 
to 
disciplinary 
action 
been 
taken 
against 
those 
responsible.” 
20 
 
Is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, that is correct but ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So would ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   But let me... I might have elevated that 
one to the board.  I do not recall now. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 25 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But would you confirm then that 
condonation was applied for? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it was applied for. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then if you go to page 14 
of your affidavit, paragraph 8.2 deals with HMG.  That is the 
other big contract that you spoke of.  Is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where do you deal with AWP? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is somewhere in the report.  I cannot... I 
am not sure but it is somewhere there.  I will have to find it 
myself.  Ja.  It is somewhere in there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you deal with it in your 
declaration? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  It is actually in a board meeting... 
minute as well where... I think it was a June board meeting 
where now this condonation was elevated to the board and 
the board did condone the expenditure on AWP.  But let us 
come back to HMG.  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  I want to then, to take you to 
paragraph 9 and to focus then in... on the disciplinary action 
taken against Mr Gama.  Is there anything else that you want 
to say in relation to deviations and condonation historical? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really.  Let us go to then paragraph 9. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 26 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Thank you.  So perhaps I 
could ask you to deal with this.  Could you start with 
paragraph 9.1 and take the Chairperson through your 
evidence in this regard. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Should I read it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, it would be better if you 
verbalise it but of course you are allowed to have regard to 
the text of the declaration.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Now, let me first... let me verbalise it.  
From the view of... by the way, even this verbalisation, I 
10 
think it maybe comes from the KPMG report, which was 
trying to indicate that on similar matters like Gama, the 
company was consistent in dealing with certain issues.   
 
But then again, on similar matters like Gama, the 
company was not consistent in that there are other...  Now 
these matters are not identical, by the way.  We need to 
understand that.   
 
Because if then you are looking for detail into what are 
these matters.  They are not the same.  They are not the 
same.  Ja.  In a nutshell, that is it. 
20 
 
Now in a nutshell as well.  What I am trying to indicate 
and not with certainty is that.  Had Gama been given the 
opportunity to go through the condonation process, maybe 
the authority to condone might have come with a different 
sanction.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 27 of 247 
 
 
I do not know.  Maybe demotion.  Maybe dismissal.  I 
really do not know.  But there is that possibility that they are 
authorising individual, would have come to a different 
conclusion. 
 
Same as, we had asked as a board that those who were 
guilty of certain irregular and certain fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure contracts, must be disciplined.  I do not know 
the outcome of those disciplinary actions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, let me take you to the 
text. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say at paragraph 9.2: 
“I submit that with regard to the Gama matter and a 
review of similar fact matters.  The board was of the 
view 
that 
disciplinary 
action 
instituted 
for 
the 
committed irregularities appeared rather to be an 
exception rather than the rule.   
We further noted that the disciplinary process was 
not consistently applied to all transgressions but 
rather a process of condonation is consistently 
20 
applied with no disciplinary action being taken 
against offenders.   
These observations are in line with Mr Gama’s view 
that “he was doubtful” that other employees who 
acted in a way similar to that way he had, had been 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 28 of 247 
 
charged for tender irregularities and that there was 
a selective application of charges.” 
 
You say then: 
“Gama 
was 
not 
afforded 
the 
opportunity 
for 
condonement in his matter, based on the view that 
the transgressions were of such a serious nature 
that they warranted a disciplinary action. 
However, evidence also suggests that other senior 
employees had in certain instances not complied 
with the necessary procurement procedures, yet, 
10 
none of them were subjected to any disciplinary 
procedures as Mr Gama was.” 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what it states.  And then in 
two, perhaps, important passages that I may ask you a 
number of questions about.  You say: 
“I 
personally 
fully 
agree 
with 
the 
disciplinary 
process and findings of the then Transnet Board  
The only difficulty I have, is that there was this 
common process in the Transnet’s systems called 
20 
condonation. 
Based on the context of TFR on condonations, 
Gama should have by virtue of consistency of its 
application been afforded the opportunity to apply 
for condonation.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 29 of 247 
 
Gama was not given the opportunity to apply for this 
by Transnet Internal Audit and the then GCEO, Ms 
Maria Ramos. 
The outcomes could have been different had he 
been afforded that opportunity.” 
 
That is what you have said, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Can I comment? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, certainly. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is why I say the outcome could have 
been that no company have been the same.  Even though it 
would 
have 
gone 
through 
whatever... 
...[indistinct] 
application.  It could have been the same.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just incidentally.  Did Mr Gama apply 
for condonation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not know.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   I really do not know, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at paragraph 9...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Did you try and find out 
whether he had at any stage applied for condonation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I did not because, as you could 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 30 of 247 
 
imagine, I am dealing with this matter almost seven months 
after 
Gama 
was 
dismissed. 
 
And 
there, 
I 
was 
not 
communicating with him or with anybody else.  But that 
would have been the duty of KPMG in my interpretation to 
find out if he did.  Ja, I do not know.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, is it not the position that an 
employee who seeks condonation must request condonation 
or apply for condonation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Mr Gama was a very senior employee 
10 
in the company.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He, from what I understand and from what 
I heard in the past few days about TFR at Transnet, it seems 
that TFR, it was the largest division at Transnet.   
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we are talking here about somebody 
who was employed as CEO of the largest division within 
20 
cabinet... within Transnet.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Within Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are talking about somebody who was 
leading his division with a lot of people, employees and 
other managerial under him, who is supposed to have... to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 31 of 247 
 
have had knowledge of these policies and processes we are 
talking about.  Is that not so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he would be needed... his job 
needed him to even guide those under him about... on these 
policies, is it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, you are dealing with somebody 
whom you are supposed to expect to have known of the 
existence of this condonation process and that an employee 
10 
can apply for it if the employee wishes it to be evoked.  Is 
that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   He should have known, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if he did not apply for it, there may be 
no reason why you or the board should bother to come to his 
assistance when he elected not to use it when he knew 
about it, is it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I do Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So the question that arises is that 
when the issue of condonation arose within the context of his 
dismissal dispute. 
 
I would have expected your attitude, as well as the 
attitude of the board to be that:  Well, one, we are not here 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 32 of 247 
 
dealing with a lonely employee.  We are dealing with an 
executive who knows the policies of the organisation.  First 
of all, did he apply for it?  Did he want condonation?   
 
Because if he wanted condonation, one would expect 
that would have applied.  Did he apply for it?   
 
And if the answer is he did not apply for it, then the next 
thing is:  Why should we assist him with something that he 
was aware of and could have evoked and did not evoked?  
That is the attitude I would have expected.   
 
Do you think that would... that is a fair expectation? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I do not have facts whether he 
did or whether he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But when you look at the quantum of some 
of the condonations that we had to deal with which ran into 
billions of rands.  And those were granted subject to 
disciplinary action.  I do not have a record of whether did he 
or did he not.  I really do not have that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I accept that you do not know 
whether he did or he did not. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is part of my question because I 
am saying.  Since you knew as the board that you are 
dealing with an executive who ought to know the company 
policies and so on.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 33 of 247 
 
 
When this issue of condonation was raised in the context 
of his dismissal.  My expectation is that the first reaction 
from you and the board ought to have been:  Did he apply for 
it?   
 
Because this condonation, you have to apply for it as an 
employee if you wanted to be evoked.  And I am concerned 
about why you did not ask that question or you did not try to 
establish whether he did apply for it. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, my interpretation is that the 
KPMG Forensic should have looked into whether he did or 
10 
not.  That is why there is an element of doubt as well, 
whether it would have been granted or not granted that 
condonation.   
 
And whether he would have been disciplined or not 
disciplined based on the other similar matters of contracts 
which ran into billions and no disciplinary action was taken 
against those individuals except in 2011 when the offences 
were committed in 2005.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but maybe I am not articulating my 
concern as clearly as I should.  You... I accept that you say 
20 
you do not know whether he did apply for condonation.   
 
I accept that you say that you did not investigate that 
issue.  I accept for present purposes that you think KPMG 
maybe should have looked into that issue.   
 
My issue is.  My expectation is that before you went to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 34 of 247 
 
look into any number of previous cases where condonation 
had been granted, I would have expected you and the board 
to say:  Oh, there is this issue of condonation being raised.  
But condonation has to be applied for.  We want to find out 
whether he did apply.  And if he did apply, what was the 
outcome of that process?   
 
Before you could go and dig and dig and dig.  That is my 
question.  I am wondering why that is not the attitude you 
and the board took?   
 
And I am asking whether you think my expectation of 
10 
what your board should have done is unfair or you accept 
that it is fair? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think it is fair Chairman.  And I 
emphasise with your position.  And then, of course, these 
things happened many years ago.  I still do not know if he 
did apply.  It will be of interest to still get that information 
whether did he apply or not.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And at Transnet, this application for 
condonation was a strange thing because at times, it came 
20 
via Transnet Internal Audit.  And now, my recollection now as 
an executive which is maybe in 1996 of 1997.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MKWANAZI:   In a situation like this, the request for a 
condonation would not just have come directly from the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 35 of 247 
 
individual.  It would have come in partnership with the 
Transnet Internal Audit so that it is put on record that as you 
get this condonation you also get the final written warning.  
That was the culture then but that is many, many years ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   In Transnet itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay no, that is fine.  My Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, you say 
that KPMG should have looked into this but of course, you 
agreed to reinstate Mr Gama long before KPMG completed 
10 
its investigation. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  As I indicate, there was a 
preliminary report by KPMG.  If you would recall, when 
Transnet responded to the Public Protector’s letter in April of 
2011.  There was a preliminary KPMG report attached.  Now, 
I have not seen that report.   
 
And it is also true that even as early as... before the end 
of January, there was a KPMG preliminary report and other 
reports from Transnet Internal Audit on irregularities and 
procurement.  They are there.  Those reports were there.   
20 
 
And they articulated these relevant irregularities and 
also they articulated the wrongdoings, the sanctions, the no 
sanction.  So there was that element of doubt then that 
maybe there was a lack of consistency.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Mkwanazi, you dealt with Mr 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 36 of 247 
 
Gama on the basis that he had not offered or applied for 
condonation.  That is the basis upon which you dealt with 
him.   
MR MKWANAZI:   I... yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   In that, had he applied. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So let us go again ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   The outcome would have been different, 
ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us go to the last sentence of 
10 
paragraph 9.4.  You say, in effect, if he had applied, the 
outcome could have been different.  Is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us go to paragraph 9.5.   
“The incoming Transnet Board of 2010 which was 
dealing with this mega projects that were frankly not 
managed well.” 
 
Had you somehow tried and deal with the Gama matter 
on the assumption that he would have been granted 
condonation?   
20 
 
I do not understand because... if you just bear with me.  
At the end of paragraph 9.4 you say:  Well, you do not know 
if he would have.  But then you treat him with the benefit of 
the doubt that he would have been. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  But then having said you 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 37 of 247 
 
treat him with a doubt, you do not just do not leave it there.  
Then you have got to deal with what type of sanction.  And 
would you then have given Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh.  Please do not 
forget your line of thought. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   there is something that I should have 
asked later... earlier but I thought I would ask later but I 
think I will canvas it now.   
 
Mr Mkwanazi, if... I think we can accept that Mr Gama 
10 
did not apply for condonation.  Are you prepared to accept 
that or you think he probably did or you think he may or may 
not?   
 
I think by now we would have known if he had applied 
for condonation.  By the.. he... there was a lengthy 
disciplinary process.  You remember that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At which he was represented, not just by 
an attorney, as I understand the position, by even senior 
counsel.  You remember that? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I do . 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that disciplinary hearing, I am told, 
the actual hearing took 14-days.  And when you read the 
rulings of the chairperson, you can see that the matters were 
dealt with extensively.  Now do you think that Mr Gama, if he 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 38 of 247 
 
had applied for condonation, he would not have told his 
lawyers that he applied for condonation and it was granted if 
it was like that ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   He should have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or it was refused, if it was refused?  He 
would have known?   
MR MKWANAZI:   He should have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Definitely, he would have disclosed it, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is anticipated that he would not have 
10 
mentioned that he did apply for it, is it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So we can accept that he did not 
apply for it.  And actually, you do know, do you not, that the 
issue of condonation was raised at the disciplinary hearing 
by his lawyers.  You know that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I recall, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the lawyers would have dealt with all 
of those issues and they would have said he applied for 
condonation and if he was granted condonation, they would 
20 
have said that.  We would be knowing it from the ruling of 
the chairperson.   
 
Or if he was refused condonation and they thought he 
was unfairly refused, they would have told the chairperson of 
the disciplinary inquiry.  You accept that? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 39 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he did not apply for condonation, 
okay?  And if... and you either knew that he did not apply or 
if you did not know, to get to know would have been the 
easiest thing, is it not, to find out, did he apply?  One way is 
to ask him or ask his lawyers.  You accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I accept that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, as I understand your affidavit.  
The door that you or the board used in order to get to 
reinstate him is to say Mr Gama was not offered the 
10 
opportunity of a condonation.  Is that... am I right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   You are correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, if... is it fair to put it that way, 
when you are dealing with an executive like Mr Gama 
because he did not need to be offered condonation?  He 
knew there was this process.  He knew he could apply for it.  
And he elected, for whatever reason, not to apply for that.  
You accept that, do you not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I accept that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if there is any unfairness arising from 
20 
that, it would be an unfairness that he brought it upon 
himself by deciding not apply for that process, is it not?  You 
accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 40 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I accept that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once you accept that there was nothing 
unfair about him not having been offered the opportunity of 
condonation because he knew he could apply.  He elected 
for reasons known to himself not to apply.  Then, is it not the 
position that then there is no sympathy for him?  There ought 
to be no sympathy for him.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, your observation is correct.  
And also, then Chairman, it is a stringent environment at 
Transnet in that... I am not sure how many condonations 
10 
were granted every year in that organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And I am not sure but it was quite 
common.  But that he did not take that advantage in terms of 
that, I do not know why he did not do it.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he cannot blame anybody and the 
board cannot and should not have relied on that to feel any 
sympathy for him because this is a senior executive.  He 
knows the policies of the organisation.  He knows these 
processes.   
20 
 
And at the time, or after he had been told that he was 
going to face a disciplinary inquiry, he employed lawyers 
including senior counsel.  He had no disadvantage in dealing 
with these charges.  He had the advantage of a legal team at 
his disposal to advise him.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 41 of 247 
 
 
Therefore, the board – that is what I am putting to you – 
had... did not have grounds based on condonation to feel 
any sympathy for him.  What do you say ? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I agree with you but the board 
at the time, viewed a lot of other similar cases were done in 
2005/2006 
and 
they 
hung 
on 
unresolved 
with 
no 
condonation for five, six years and those condonations get 
applied for in 2011 because at that time in 2011 we pushed 
through a communication in the organisation that this 
condonation must come to a halt and also we elevated the 
10 
authority to allow condonations to the office of the Group 
Chief Executive only and on top of that we requested that 
each 
and 
every 
irregularity 
in 
procurement 
must 
be 
reported to the board and to the audit committee regularly 
because these things have got an impact on how we report 
our annual financial statements and also, if I recall in 
terms of these irregularities, we then even said that we will 
voluntarily report then to the shareholder because they 
were an embarrassment to the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but all I am simply saying is, insofar 
20 
as Mr Gama may have been complaining that his dismissal 
was unfair because of condonation, the board had no 
grounds to rely on condonation to come to his assistance 
in circumstances where he had elected, in circumstances 
where he had elected not to invoke that process.  You 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 42 of 247 
 
accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree with you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, 
before the Chairperson asked you that series of questions, 
do I understand your evidence to have been in effect that 
you said well, look, let us assume that he applied for 
condonation. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The worst that would have happened 
10 
to him is that he would have got a final warning because 
that  was the precedent.  Sorry …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Worse than not, not necessarily a final 
written warning, maybe worse than that, maybe dismissal, 
maybe demotion, whatever the people dealing with it would 
have decided but maybe worse than that, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But then why did you reinstate him? 
MR MKWANAZI:   The reinstatement comes from a view 
that there were similar cases or even worse cases where 
no disciplinary action was taken for six year on these 
20 
cases. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, Mr Mkwanazi, you have just 
said that the result could have been worse, it might have 
involved a dismissal. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not know – I do not know in terms of 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 43 of 247 
 
– I am losing my thoughts a little bit, can you come back, 
Advocate? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well, I mean the real problem 
you have is you do not know what would have happened 
but for some extraordinary reason you dealt with Mr Gama 
in the most generous fashion and you just divine that he 
would have somehow have been reinstated. 
MR MKWANAZI:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that he somehow would have 
not been dismissed. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct at the time when this 
thing was being dealt with but, as I indicate, there were 
close to 22 other executives who maybe could have done 
something similar and based on that sentiment that here 
are these 22 other executives who have not even been 
disciplined 
and 
also 
based 
on 
discussions 
and 
engagements with the board then that decision was taken 
that maybe a reinstatement with a – ja, with a limited 
sanction is appropriate, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, Mr Mkwanazi, there were people 
20 
who conducted themselves – certainly that is the finding of 
KPMG – in the same way as Gama and were dismissed.  
That was one of their findings. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 44 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and in fact have you heard of Mr 
Salemela and Mr Khanya? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know that they were the two 
people 
who 
signed 
the 
GNS 
confinement 
and 
then 
presented it to Mr Gama and then he signed it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And do you know what 
happened to them? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think they were dismissed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, they were dismissed.  Those 
are two person involved in the same misconduct as Mr 
Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was their senior.  You remember 
that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I do, he was the CEO of TFR. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says was the CEO of TFR. 
MR MKWANAZI:   He was the CEO of TFR. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and have you ever taken the 
time to read the finding of Nazeer Cassim SC in that case? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was Chairperson of the disciplinary 
enquiry relating to those two employees. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 45 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You never read it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I have not read it, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not have any difficulty with 
them being dismissed, did you? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure if I was there at the time.  
What year was it, if I can be reminded? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It was in 2010. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But one would have expected that when 
10 
you dealt with Mr Gama’s matter the fact that two 
employees who were under him had been dismissed in 
connection with one of the tenders, for which he was 
dismissed, I would have expected that you would have 
been informed of that. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, we were not informed of those two 
employees, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you only get to know about 
them much later? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I did know about it much, much later, 
20 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, let me just understand 
before I move on.  You, as the Acting Group Chief 
Executive and the Chairperson, when you took a decision 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 46 of 247 
 
to reinstate Mr Gama where he had been dismissed on one 
of the charges in relation to GNS, you did not even know 
that 
two 
other 
managers 
junior 
than 
him 
had 
been 
dismissed.  You did not even know that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I did not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you had known that 
presumably your decision would have been different, of 
course. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It might have been, yes, because I would 
have had to look at the facts, etcetera, etcetera and even 
10 
the motivation to the board would have been different.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It might be. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But on the same matter these individuals 
already have been dismissed and the motivation would 
have been completely different. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you got to know about these two 
employees who were dismissed who were under Mr Gama 
would it have been a few months after Mr Gama had come 
back or are you not able to indicate? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I do not recall but it would not have 
been a few months, it was much later when one was 
reading about some of the goings on in Transnet and in 
former employees because there were many others, by the 
way, there were many things going on there at the time. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 47 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, it seems to me, Mr Mkwanazi, 
what you did is you focused on alleged inconsistencies 
instead of consistencies.  I mean here were two people 
whose dismissals were consistent with Mr Gama’s.  Why 
did you look at it the other way?  I mean, you had the 
benefit …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Advocate, you are correct, I did focus on 
inconsistencies because my line of thinking was why is this 
individual – when we say my line, even my submissions to 
10 
the board and discussions with the board, why is this 
individual unfairly prejudiced when there are 22 others who 
should have gone through the same experience and 
nothing has happened to these?  That was my line of 
thinking at the time and that is the motivation I submitted 
to the board.   
 
And also at the time, as well, I was getting 
dossiers, if I can use the word, on a lot of irregularities in 
the organisation during the month of January 2010. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, we will come to the 22 in time 
20 
but perhaps I could just ask you, so why did you not just 
discipline the 22? 
MR MKWANAZI:   We – hold it, we did ask Brian Molefe to 
discipline them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 48 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   As a board.  I do not know if he did do 
that, I do not have feedback on that but I am aware he 
tried to discipline two and he did discipline one, Gary 
Kita(?) if I recall and I do not know about the others.  We 
never followed up with Mr Brian Molefe. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps you miss my point.  Why did 
you not just retain the dismissal of Mr Gama and then 
discipline and dismiss the other 22?  Why not?  Why did 
you do it the other way around? 
MR MKWANAZI:   The point is valid, we did it the other 
10 
way around because we were sensing unfairness on the 
sanction of dismissal, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But – well, let me just clarify something.  
This concept of condonation within Transnet, it did not 
mean that if condonation was granted the employee would 
not be disciplined, is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Indeed you have testified that in respect 
of some of the condonations that the board dealt with in 
2011 you specifically, as the board, instructed the Group 
20 
CEO Mr Molefe to take disciplinary action against certain 
managers, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I must confess that when I first 
read – or for some time after reading about this point of 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 49 of 247 
 
condonation, 
I 
thought 
that 
what 
it 
meant 
was 
if 
condonation is granted it means that whatever misconduct 
the employee may have committed in connection with that 
procurement will not lead to disciplinary action but Mr 
Todd’s evidence and his affidavit made the distinction and I 
think your evidence seems to be in line with his to say 
condonation does not mean that you are not going to be 
disciplined, is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, Chairman, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No my difficulty then is what then is the 
10 
relevance of condonation where the issue is whether the 
employee was dismissed fairly or not.  Why is condonation 
a relevant factor? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, you almost need to take the 
discussion a little bit back.  I agree that Mr Gama was 
dismissed fairly in terms of the processes but the question 
is, had there been a process of him even applying for that 
condonation, the outcome might have been different.  The 
outcome could have been the same, frankly, or the 
outcome could have been he is demoted, the outcome – I 
20 
do not know what the outcome could have been but 
because for whatever reason, his issue did not go through 
a condonation process.  Yes, the outcome that came out, 
came out as per - Advocate [indistinct] 13.57. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not understand.  If the policy 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 50 of 247 
 
of the company is that employees may not do a, b, c, d and 
if they do a, b, c, d they will be disciplined and the 
disciplinary process could lead to their dismissal. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And an employee is alleged to have 
committed that misconduct or acts of misconduct, a, b, c, 
d… 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And a disciplinary process is then 
instituted, the employee, as I understand your evidence, 
10 
cannot say as a defence to the charges or charges against 
him, I have been condoned or my noncompliance with the 
procedures has been condoned, is it not?  That is not a 
defence to the charge. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I cannot say that, no, no.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if it is not a defence to the charge, 
why is it relevant to the question of whether the sanction 
that gets imposed on the employee at the end of the 
disciplinary process for misconduct, a, b, c, d was fair? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I think I will repeat myself.  It 
20 
is a what if.  Typically – say Mr Gama had applied for 
condonation and say the outcome of that application was 
you are going to be disciplined and the outcome of that 
disciplinary process is a dismissal, that is fair, Chairman, 
because 
he 
had 
an 
opportunity 
to 
apply 
for 
that 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 51 of 247 
 
condonation.   
Your points about did he apply or did he not apply, 
was it was granted or was it not granted are valid, 
Chairman, I agree with you fully and being a senior 
executive, that he was, your points are valid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see – because part of what I am 
trying to understand and Mr Myburgh is also trying to do 
the same, is the reasoning of the board in deciding to 
reinstate him because when one looks at the charges of 
which he was found guilty, I do not know in your mind but 
10 
in my mind they are very serious for a senior executive in 
the position in which he was, so -.and when you look at the 
rulings of the Chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry both 
in regard to whether he was guilty of these charges or not 
and in regard to the sanction, they are very thorough, they 
are very, very detailed and then you can see that the 
Chairperson took care to consider the evidence and the 
arguments very carefully, you know? 
And this was an independent Chairperson, it was 
not somebody who might have been involved in any  - 
20 
maybe factions within Transnet, if there were factions.  But 
it was somebody who was independent, a senior member of 
the bar. 
 
So you then say but how could the board decide 
that this person must be reinstated?  So you look for their 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 52 of 247 
 
reasoning and central to the board’s reasoning is the 
condonation process.  So because that is central to the 
board’s reasoning as to why they reinstated Mr Gama, once 
you say to me condonation does not mean that the 
employee’s misconduct is condoned and he cannot be 
disciplined anymore, then I say but what was the relevance 
of condonation then because you have accepted that it was 
not a defence, it could not be a defence.  You cannot say 
when you are charged for misconduct arising out of 
procurement processes and say well, I have been granted 
10 
condonation so you cannot charge me anymore.   
 
So help me understand where it is relevant because 
it is not relevant to the issue of guilt, is it not?  It is not 
relevant to the question whether the employee is guilty of 
the charges.  Is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, there are two stages that the 
board is trying to explain.  The one is that there was a 
process of condonation within the Transnet but that 
condonation did not imply that you will not be disciplined. 
 
Now 
knowing 
that 
there 
was 
this 
system 
of 
20 
condonation then the question was when this Gama matter 
was dealt with, there were many other cases where 
condonation had not even been applied for, but I am going 
back to an argument that Advocate Myburgh touched on, 
that we do not know whether Gama would have been 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 53 of 247 
 
granted condonation.  Even if he would have been granted, 
it would have been subject to disciplinary action and the 
outcome of that disciplinary action, we do not know what it 
could have been.  Could have been a demotion, a 
dismissal, etcetera.   
 
So that was our thinking then.  Now in fairness to 
what you are saying, the board would have had no ground 
if a condonation process had been done by Mr Gama to 
deal with these matters.  That board would not have had 
any grounds.  
10 
 
But that board, as well, would have had to deal with 
the 22 other cases which originate as early as 2005 and 
that board did try to do that.  I am not sure how far Brian 
Molefe went but the board did try to deal with those. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 You 
see, 
for 
me, 
once 
you 
say 
condonation 
does 
not 
mean 
that 
any 
allegations 
of 
misconduct or any misconduct by the employees condoned 
it actually means that those who have the power to make 
the decision whether the employee is charged or not, they 
must do their job.  What outcome happens, that outcome 
20 
will happen, okay? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now so when you – if you then say to 
time, you know, found as a board that, you know, Mr Gama 
was not offered condonation, my reaction is and so what?  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 54 of 247 
 
He was not offered condonation and so what?  That is my 
reaction. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I am saying condonation would 
not have changed anything.   
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If he was guilty of misconduct the 
disciplinary process would have led to him being found 
guilty and if the sanction of dismissal was found to be 
10 
appropriate it would have been imposed irrespective of 
whether he was granted condonation or not.  You accept 
that, do you not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I accept that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I go back to my question.  He was 
not offered condonation and so what?  That is my question 
because I do not see where it comes in. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It comes in, Chairman, in that  - the 
process was incomplete in that the issue of condonation 
should have been tabled by him post this matter being 
20 
elevated but it looks like he did not and now then this 
board 
looks 
at 
this 
and 
says 
had 
he 
applied 
for 
condonation, the outcome have been different – it might 
not have been different, yes, I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the fact of the matter is he did not 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 55 of 247 
 
apply and because he did not apply, he should not get the 
benefit that he may have got if he had applied.  If you want 
the benefits …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I do not have my facts 
whether he applied or not.  I do not have my facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, if you want the benefits of 
condonation, whatever they may be, you apply. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not apply for condonation you 
do not get the benefits that come with condonation.  You 
10 
accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, therefore, once the board accepted 
that he had not applied, it should not have sought to give 
him benefits of condonation that would only apply if he had 
applied.  You accept that now? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I do not know if he applied or 
not.  I still do not know, Chairman.  But based on the 
record of the proceedings and also maybe whatever 
submission his attorney would have made, it looks like he 
20 
did not apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So what I am saying is that the 
board should have sought to establish whether he applied. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, I agree, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if it established that he did not 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 56 of 247 
 
apply, it should not have sought to give him the benefits of 
something that he did not apply for.  You accept that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, Chairman.  Okay, alright.  Mr 
Myburgh, I know that I interrupted you but I know that you 
have not forgotten your questions. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I have not, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I see we are at twenty fast past, 
shall we take the tea break? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly, thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, we will take the tea break 
10 
for fifteen minutes we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Mr Chairperson, Mr 
Mkwanazi before I finish off with your statement I just want 
to confirm as I understand it that you make these two 
20 
concessions in response to the Chairperson’s questions.   
Firstly, you accept that you went wrong in giving Mr Gama 
the benefit of not having applied for condonation, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, that is correct, but also let us not 
forget that by the time we were dealing with this matter 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 57 of 247 
 
Gama had taken the matter to the Transnet Bargaining 
Council and in view of that then the Board had engaged 
Deneys Reitz etcetera, etcetera, for advice on what you 
may call the winability of this case at the Bargaining 
Council, but yes I do accept that Gama should have 
applied for condonation, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are going to come to that advice 
that you received.    
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The second concession that you 
10 
made in response to the Chairperson questions is you 
accept that in any event condonation and disciplinary 
action are two different things.  Correct?   
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact as I understand you, you 
accept that whether or not someone is granted condonation 
does not necessarily have a bearing on the fairness of the 
sanction of dismissal.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Let us then move to 
20 
your affidavit.  So we have dealt with paragraphs 9.4 and 
9.5, then you say at 9.6: 
“Following a review of Mr Gama’s dismissal from 
Transnet the Board resolved that the sanction given 
to Mr Gama was too harsh given the circumstances.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 58 of 247 
 
As well as the fact that he should in fact been 
granted an opportunity to apply for condonation.” 
Well we have dealt with that.      
MR MKWANAZI:   We have dealt with that, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you go onto say at 9.7: 
“In view of avoiding further litigation in respect of 
Mr Gama’s appeal of his dismissal the Board 
resolved that it would be in the best interest of 
Transnet to settle the matter by way of a settlement 
agreement.” 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “The terms of which we are 
negotiated 
through Transnet’s internal bargaining process.”   
Is that what you say?  
MR MKWANAZI:   With the help of external lawyers, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you were actually the negotiator.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really I was the lead negotiator if I 
can put it that way but in the process I was advised by 
Deneys Reitz.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see; you were the lead negotiator? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you say: 
“I wish further to confirm that neither the settlement 
nor the terms on which the settlement was made 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 59 of 247 
 
were influenced by any member of cabinet at the 
time.”  
Do you stand by that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, yes I do.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you remember if we go back to 
the beginning you confirmed that you had been asked to 
explain the decision to settle with Mr Gama and the terms 
of the settlement agreement.  Do you remember being 
asked to do that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, asked by who by the way? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   By the Commission that is why you 
put up this declaration.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why do you not deal in this 
declaration with what was paid to Mr Gama by way of 
salary, short term incentives, long term incentives, cost of 
his Bargaining Council referral, costs of his disciplinary 
hearing, costs of the High Court proceedings.  Why do you 
not deal with any of that when you were asked to?    
MR MKWANAZI:   Why do I not deal with – are you talking 
20 
about the letter from the Commission? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he is talking about that letter.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mkwanazi, Mr Myburgh 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 60 of 247 
 
you might wish to take him to the letter first.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just highlight the specific issues and 
then we can deal with a respond.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The letter is attached to your 
affidavit; you find that at page 21.1.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh, okay, yes I found it yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you will see at page 21.3 there 
is 
a 
heading 
reinstatement 
21.4 
retrospectivity 
of 
reinstatement these are all contentious issues.    
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Final written warning, costs those 
are all the terms of the settlement agreement.  Then at 
21.6 paragraph 7: 
“Chairperson of the Commission has directed me to 
request you to furnish the Commission on or before 
20 
August 
2020 
with 
an 
affidavit 
or 
a 
firm 
declaration in which you explain why you and or the 
Board of Directors of Transnet considered it correct 
or proper or justified to conclude the settlement 
20 
agreement on the terms on which you concluded it.”      
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that is just not reinstatement that 
is why did you give him a final warning that had expired?  
Why did you pay him full back pay, LTI’s and SDI’s and why 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 61 of 247 
 
did you pay his costs?  Do you accept you do not address 
any of that in your declaration?  
MR MKWANAZI:   If I recall I might not have addressed it 
but if I recall I wanted to submit a supplementary affidavit 
here which I have not yet done and the idea was that I 
would deal with those issues in more detail.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us firstly deal with whether or 
not you dealt with it in this declaration can you please just 
give us an answer.   
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I do not think I have.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Have a look and tell us. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not think I have, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you need an opportunity to look 
Mr Mkwanazi because I would like a straight and a 
definitive answer please? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, no I can look at the issues that are 
on that request for an affidavit, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Myburgh is inviting you to look 
at your affidavit to see whether you do deal with the issues 
that he is raising with you.  
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   In my affidavit that I have got in front of 
me I do not deal with those issues but I did indicate to my 
lawyer that I wanted to make a supplementary affidavit.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi you also do not say 
anything about wanting to put up a supplementary affidavit 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 62 of 247 
 
in this affidavit, do you?   
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I did not say anything, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why not if that was your intention? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe let us ask when did you think 
of the idea of the supplementary affidavit?  
MR MKWANAZI:   A long time ago and in actual fact I have 
got a draft but my lawyers are supposed to have a look at 
it first before it comes to the Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh but quite some time after you had 
delivered this one to the Commission?  
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct I do not know the date of 
that one but it is dated Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mr Myburgh.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you and then at paragraph 10 
you say and you have dealt with this already: 
“When Brian Molefe joined the Transnet Board he 
was instructed to take disciplinary action against all 
officials implicated in the KPMG and the Nkonki 
report” 
Correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you go and deal with that 
further you say at 10.5: 
“The 
Board 
at 
the 
time 
left 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
disciplinary processes in the hands of Mr Molefe.” 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 63 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And here you say: 
“There could have been another 12 senior managers 
who could have been disciplined.”  
Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Early on in your evidence you spoke 
about 22 can we reduce that to 12? 
MR MKWANAZI:   The number is actually higher but let us 
remain with 12 but yes there could be 22 because then I 
10 
have got to go back and take them out by line item or by 
name but I am happy with 12.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well here you say 12.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, I say 12 but I am saying it could be 
higher.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  
MR MKWANAZI:   I will have to go back to the report and 
actually generate a list.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then if we go over the page to 
paragraph 11 your conclusion: 
20 
“The 
above 
factors 
information 
at 
the 
Boards 
disposal as well as the legal opinion sought by the 
Board were considered.” 
Now we going to come to the sequence and chronology of 
events in some detail when I take you through it Mr 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 64 of 247 
 
Mkwanazi but the opinion of which firm of attorneys are 
you referring to here?    
MR MKWANAZI:   It is Deneys Reitz.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so are you saying that 
Deneys Reitz opinion was before the Board on the 16 t h? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  
MR MKWANAZI:   There were two pieces of opinion by 
Deneys Reitz if I recall.  There was one which you call an 
abridged version and then there was another one which 
10 
was a more detailed version substantiating what was in the 
abridged version, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, well then I think I understand 
it.  So you are right there were Deneys Reitz opinion or 
certainly input from Deneys Reitz in a document dated the 
15 t h of February the day before the Board meeting and 
then on the 22 n d of February a few days later there was the 
more expanded version.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let me then – so is there anything 
20 
else you want to say in relation to your declaration and 
your statement before I move into my questioning of you?   
MR MKWANAZI:   At this stage – you are going to come 
back to the Deneys Reitz and things, I take it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 65 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay good.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let me start off and I am going to 
run through the chronology of events.  Amongst the files 
that we have put up is a Bundle 2 where we have got a 
very long extract from the evidence of Barbara Hogan and 
perhaps I should start…[intervene]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 2.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   …there, yes.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay I have got Bundle 2 in front of me.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So could I take you please Mr 
10 
Mkwanazi to page 216.  This is an extract from the 
evidence of Ms Hogan before this Commission.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 216? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   216.  
MR MKWANAZI:   I have got it, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I thought perhaps the one way to 
speed this up is for me to take you to page 250 and to read 
to you a paragraph from her affidavit or statement that was 
read into the record at page 250 line 10.  Are you there?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I am there, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh which bundle?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 2, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Bundle 2, yes okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From line 11: 
“I was shocked and disappointed when President 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 66 of 247 
 
Zuma informed me that he was adamant that Mr 
Gama was the only choice for the Group CEO.” 
But just to place that in context Mr Gama was suspended 
on the 1 s t of September 2009.  There was then an attempt 
to fill a vacant CEO position of Transnet and when Ms 
Hogan presented the name of Mr Maseko to former 
President Zuma her evidence was that he was insistent 
that Mr Gama be appointed and this is what she said: 
“I was shocked and disappointed when President 
Zuma informed me that he was adamant that Mr 
10 
Gama was the only choice for the Group CEO.  I 
informed him that that was not possible and that Mr 
Gama was not the Board’s choice and I could not 
override the Board as they had undergone a very 
professional selection process.  I further informed 
President Zuma that Mr Gama was the subject of an 
enquiry into procurement irregularities and that it 
would be very messy to appoint a Group CEO who 
could potentially be facing fairly serious charges.”  
President Zuma said: 
20 
“That 
if 
that 
was 
my 
view 
no 
appointment 
whatsoever would be made at Transnet until Mr 
Gama’s disciplinary process was over.”   
“We agreed that I would provide him with more 
information.”    
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 67 of 247 
 
You have no doubt heard this of this testimony before  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I have never seen it in this way but 
I have read about it, ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, you have read about it.  So 
there was then a hiatus because Ms Hogan had to wait 
until the outcome of Mr Gama’s disciplinary enquiry and 
then let us go to that part at page 267 at line 22.    
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Now you know I waited for the 
Outcome of the disciplinary hearing but once he 
10 
was found guilty on three counts and he was 
dismissed on all three counts the Deputy Minister 
and myself initiated a process to appoint a new 
Transnet Board and that was, that was then a year 
after of this happening and it was then towards 
July, August 2010.”   
Do you see that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the if I can ask you to please to 
go to page 277.  Ms Hogan then attempted to constitute a 
20 
new Board or have a new Board appointed but she says at 
line number 3 at page 277.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Which line is that, can I – advocate what 
paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 277, line 3.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 68 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   She says: 
“Well Mr Gama was fired at the end of 2010 – we 
know that was in July – and I was fired by the 
President at the end of October.” 
A few lines down…[intervene]   
CHAIRPERSON:   He was fired on the 29 t h of June? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   28 t h or 29 t h June, yes. 
“I was fired by the President at the end of October.” 
And then at line 10: 
10 
“Mr Molefe was then appointed as the CEO of 
Transnet.” 
Line 14: 
“Then Mr Gama was reappointed – so this is where 
you enter the scene – as the CEO of Transnet 
Freight Rail a couple of months later on the grounds 
that they had reviewed the sanction and that they 
had an independent review.  I do not quite know 
what that was about.” 
Chairperson says: 
20 
“This was now a different Board from the one that 
was in existence during your time.” 
“This was a Board - said Ms Hogan – that had been 
appointed by Minister Gigaba who succeeded me.” 
And you we know were the Chairperson, correct? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 69 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Mkwanazi this is also 
something I can take you to other passages in her 
evidence that received a lot of publicity Mr Gama’s 
suspension and disciplinary action it was something of a 
political hot potato, not so?   
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you knew about that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I knew.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you know that Ms Hogan had 
10 
been or lost her post as a Minister in these circumstances? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I did not know that in detail but I know it 
now having read what I am reading.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the new Minister, Mr Gigaba he 
was appointed as I understand it Chairperson you will 
correct me if I am wrong with the effect from the 1 s t of 
November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you then met did you with the 
new Minister and the Chairperson has asked you and you 
20 
confirmed you did that in October before he had even been 
appointed.  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct advocate, Chair.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, and you set out in your 
declaration what it is that you discussed.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 70 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we go please back to your 
declaration Bundle 4A.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 4A? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I want to take you to page 4.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay thank you, yes I am on page 4.  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
You 
say 
at 
paragraph 
4.3…[intervene]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I can ask you to drop down to 
10 
4.3.3: 
“He 
was 
somehow 
aware 
of 
problems 
in 
the 
procurement of suppliers and services for mega 
projects in Transnet.” 
Did it surprise you that he was aware of that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   The answer is no it does not surprise me 
because maybe some of these were already in the media or 
maybe he had some inside information say from Transnet 
on what could have been happening in procurement.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi was it also in the 
20 
media that former President Zuma was a devout supporter 
of Mr Gama? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it was and maybe even more in the 
media but yes it was in the media.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you were aware of that? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 71 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I was aware of that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us go to paragraph 4.3.4: 
“He was also under the impression that disciplinary 
matters at Transnet were racially based.” 
And it is the next part of the sentence that I want to focus 
on. 
“And that there was a condonation process at 
Transnet that was generally used to deal with 
deviations within Transnet.” 
He seemed to know a lot about this.     
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I see that paragraph.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, how do you think he came to 
know about that?  You smile.  
MR MKWANAZI:   You know advocate you need to 
understand how State owned entities operate.  They 
operate in very strange ways where within this entities 
some of these Ministers have got sources of information 
particularly these big SOC’s like say Eskom, Transnet and I 
do not know who else but I suspect somebody inside the 
organisation would have briefed the Minister about that or 
20 
maybe even outside of the organisation in that case I am 
assuming that it could have been Gama himself.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry; do you mean that even if a 
Minister is not a Minister of Public Enterprises very often 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 72 of 247 
 
they have people within the different SOE’s that maybe tell 
them some of the matters that are going on in those SOE’s 
or what?      
MR MKWANAZI:   That is what I mean Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They have a lot of interest in the SOE’s? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is what I mean Chairman maybe to 
take it a little bit further Chairman you will have to 
understand that some of these Ministers and members of 
parliament have got companies that somehow I suspect 
they have got an interest in what is happening in these 
10 
companies.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.      
MR MKWANAZI:   In these State owned entities so which is 
why they have an interest of tender opportunities if I can 
use the word of whether did they exist or not.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well obviously Mr Mkwanazi you 
see I am laughing. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you, of course you were involved in 
different also or is it different times and in different 
20 
capacities so I take it you know what you are talking about.  
Is that right?    
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you mean a lot of the Ministers would 
have companies and they would be looking at tender 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 73 of 247 
 
opportunities in the various SOE’s? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr 
Mkwanazi so just before the Chairman asked you a 
question I just want you to confirm that you said in fact 
that the Minister might actually have heard about this from 
Mr Gama himself.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I did let me maybe expand on this 
the Chairman will recall that at some stage while Mr Gama 
10 
was on suspension Mr Gama was lobbying virtually many 
Ministers.  I do not know which ones now but yes therefore 
my assumption is that maybe he had shared this or if it was 
not him it could have been any other employee because 
the employees in these State owned entities are strange 
animals to a certain extent because they have got certain 
direct lines to Ministers to which even me as the Chairman 
at the time might not have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well when Ms Barbara Hogan gave 
evidence about the matter of Mr Gama she also did say 
20 
that a number of politicians including Ministers went public 
while the process of recruiting of or appointing a Group 
CEO while it was underway and when there was talk of Mr 
Gama being suspended or being charged or when he had 
been suspended or was being charged there were some 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 74 of 247 
 
politicians who went public calling for Mr Gama to be 
appointed as the Group CEO and saying that the charges 
against him were unfair or were trumped up or were 
intended to prevent him from being appointed as a Group 
CEO of Transnet Ms Hogan have that evidence and I think 
at the time when she gave evidence a newspaper clippings 
were included in the bundle that was used.   
And indeed I think there was a newspaper article 
where I think Mr Mantashe was said to have made 
statements as well supporting Mr Gama.  I think Minister 
10 
Nyanda, General Nyanda I think he was Minister at the 
time he was also reported in some article to have also 
come out as well as Minister Radebe so that is in the 
public domain and it is before the Commission in terms of 
the bundles relating to Ms Hogan’s evidence so that part 
was referred to.     
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understand it you knew 
about all of that?  
MR MKWANAZI:    It was in the news.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps if I could just ask you to 
20 
turn to page 253 of Bundle 2, two five three.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay, two five three, wait two five three 
is it Ms Barbara Hogan’s bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, at the top again it is quoting for 
her statement: 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 75 of 247 
 
“Mr Gama was formerly charged by Transnet and 
later suspended on 1 September 2009 immediately 
before and in the days following his suspension.”  
Minister Jeff Radebe: 
“Gama will become CEO.” 
Minister Simphiwe Nyanda: 
“Gama is being persecuted like Jacob Zuma and 
also ANC, the SACP, the South African Transport 
Union and the ANC Youth League under Julius 
Malema at the time all issued strong and harsh 
10 
statements in support of Gama accusing Transnet of 
persecuting him.  This was reflected in numerous 
statements and reported in the media which I 
attach.” 
Do you see that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now are you suggesting to the 
Chairperson that when you met with the new Minister or 
soon to be appointed Minister he never spoke to you about 
or mentioned Mr Gama? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  He did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC: Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  In my opening line or paragraph I do 
indicate that I met Mr Gigaba towards the end of October.  
And amongst a number of issues he was talking about 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 76 of 247 
 
transformation in the context of black suppliers not been 
given an opportunity particularly black legal firms and also 
African women not being elevated to top positions. And of 
course he mentioned the Gama matter and felt that the 
sanction in the Gama matter was too harsh or something 
because there was this condonation process at Transnet that 
had not been followed.  He did mention something. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why did you not put that in your – in 
your declaration? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I did. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Were you going to put that in your 
supplementary affidavit perhaps? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No it is there.  Let me check.  What folder 
it is in here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Mkwanazi what Mr Myburgh is 
talking about is that you did not mention in the affidavit that 
he raised the issue of the Mr Gama.  You just said that he 
raised the issue of condonation from deviations. 
MR MKWANAZI:  If you read on page 4 of my submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  Paragraph 4.3.4.   
“He was under the impression that these 
matters at Transnet were racially biased and 
that there was a condonation process at 
Transnet that was generally used to deal with 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 77 of 247 
 
deviations within Transnet.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was talking about the Gama matter 
under that. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I – that is correct as one of the matters 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Oh okay.  Well I must say that            
when I read your affidavit and I came to that because you 
did not refer to Mr Gama or his case as such. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I had a strong suspicion that he must have 
10 
been talking to you about the Gama matter but you are now 
confirming that there he was talking about the Gama matter.  
Is that right you are confirming that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct Chairperson yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said that the – the sanction of 
dismissal in the Gama matter was too harsh or something – 
the words to that effect. 
MR MKWANAZI:  He was basically trying to indicate that 
there was racial bias against African executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  In Transnet in that African executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Were dismissed in disciplinary issues and 
yet white executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 78 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Were not even charged or disciplined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  In procurement issues ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When he referred to the issue of 
condonation of the condonation process or a condonation 
process at Transnet under that 4.3.4 was he saying that 
condonation had not been used in regard to Mr Gama and 
that should be looked into? 
MR MKWANAZI:  He was not specific that it should be 
looked into but he was generalising that there was this 
10 
process etcetera, etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And here is this executive who has now 
been dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Did – and when he said the 
sanction of dismissal in Mr Gama’s case was too harsh. 
MR MKWANAZI:  He was basing it on the Public Protector 
letter as well if I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And yes there was by that time there was a 
20 
Public Protector letter on the 22n d December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  When he spoke to you did he have 
that documentation with him or he was just referring to it 
because he knew it? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No he did not refer to it at all.  No – I 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 79 of 247 
 
might be mixing things here.  Because the letter of the 
Public Protector only came out on the 22 nd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And the letter from Member of Parliament 
Vytjie Mentoor came on the 4 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MKWANAZI:  So it – there would be no linkage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. But he – so what was he basing 
his view on that the sanction of dismissal in Mr Gama’s case 
was too harsh as you recall?  What was he basing it on?  On 
10 
the racial issue? 
MR MKWANAZI:  In a nutshell what he was trying to say was 
white executives get away with serious – much more serious 
offences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and black executives would be 
dismissed for less serious. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And – okay alright.  But all of these 
matters that you set out under 4.3 that is 4.3.1 up to 4.3.4 
were matters that he was asking you as the…. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Person he was offering the position of 
chairperson of the board he was asking you to look into 
seriously at Transnet? 
MR MKWANAZI:  As a board yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 80 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a board yes, yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So was it apparent to use that Minister 
Gigaba had been holding discussions with Mr Gama or not? 
MR MKWANAZI:  At the time no but I am aware that Mr 
Gama had met the other Minsters and even met the 
President if I recall based on even Ms Barbara Hogan’s 
submission.  I was aware that Mr Gama was running all over 
the show trying to get sympathy from various organisations. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And when the Minister Gigaba told you 
that he thought the sanction of dismissal for Mr Gama was 
too harsh what sanction did he have in mind? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Oh please Advocate how could you [not 
audible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not ask him?  Or he did not offer? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No, no, no.  I did not ask him, he did not 
volunteer as well, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Got no clue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was it clear to you though that Minister 
Gigaba would have been in favour of the reinstatement of Mr 
Gama from this discussion and his statement that he 
considered the dismissal too harsh? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 81 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was that clear to you? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not necessarily reinstatement.  The 
question was the fairness or unfairness of that process 
which I did then pose to my legal advisors later on and they 
looked at it from two ways if I recall who was Deneys Reitz 
the fairness of the process itself and they concluded that the 
process was fair.  And then my legal advisors as well the 
fairness of the sanction and the fact that the matter was now 
going through Transnet Bargaining Council and therefore 
10 
weighing the odds of winning or losing at the Transnet 
Bargaining Council.  Those are the two things that they said 
– Reitz helped me with if I recall and then later they helped 
to draft a letter to respond to the Public Protector on some of 
the related issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi that really does not 
answer my question.  Let me perhaps put it another way. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was it clear to you further to this 
discussion with Minister Gigaba that he at very least would 
20 
have been in favour of a settlement then with Mr Gama? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not really it was not clear to me.  You need 
to understand that in my negotiations with the sub-committee 
of the board of this so called settlement at some stage I 
wanted Gama to take a demotion and at some stage as part 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 82 of 247 
 
of the negotiations.  I put in various things.  I had refused to 
offer him whatever positions he thought he would get. So I 
do not think that could have been something that he thought 
I would do.  But yes I – as I looked into it on behalf of the 
board I had to look at the fairness, unfairness and the 
probability of winning or losing at the Bargaining Council. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But Mr Mkwanazi again that is not what 
I asked you.  Could we just have a straight answer and then 
I will move on.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was it clear to you further to this 
discussion that Mr Gigaba at least would have been in favour 
of a settlement with Mr Gama yes or no? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not necessarily a settlement because 
[00:09:59] from where I sat I needed advice from legal 
experts on how to deal with this matter.  Because now this 
matter was going to the Transnet Bargaining Council.  So ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the one thing which you have said Mr 
Mkwanazi is that Mr Gigaba did say that the sanction of 
dismissal against Mr Gama was too harsh, is that correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  I think so.  I think he did indicate that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was harsh? 
MR MKWANAZI:  It was – he felt it was unfair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was unfair. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 83 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now based on what he said to you 
which you understood to be the grounds for him thinking it 
was unfair – from what you said to me it seemed clear that 
he – it was implied that he thought that Mr Gama should not 
have been dismissed.  Would you agree with that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I would agree with it but he did understand 
the dynamics of a disciplinary process 
and 
also the 
outcomes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no.  All I am saying… 
MR MKWANAZI:  He did not understand that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  All I am simply saying is that based on his 
discussion with you. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to the matter of Mr Gama it 
seems that it was implied that his view was that Mr Gama 
should not have been dismissed because you said he 
referred to – he said white executives do more serious – 
commit more serious acts of misconduct and do not get 
dismissed but black executives get dismissed even if they 
have done something less serious. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  No.  He did not say that he should not 
have been dismissed.  It was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  No. 
MR 
MKWANAZI:  It was 
questioning the fairness 
or 
unfairness of the process. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 84 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on.  I just want to make 
sure we understand.  You have not said to me that he said 
Mr – he expressly said Mr Gama should not have been 
dismissed.  You have not said that.  Okay.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I understand that you have not said 
that but what I am putting to you is what seems to me to be 
what was implied.  But you must – once I put the proposition 
to you you will indicate if you say you do not share my 
thinking that it was implied.  My… 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  No… 
CHAIRPERSON:  My – my thinking is that if he says the 
dismissal was harsh or was unfair because – and he 
advances as the reason that white executives do not get 
dismissed even when they have done or committed more 
serious offences.  It seems to me that he was saying if Mr 
Gama was a white executive he would not have been 
dismissed.  That seems to be implied to me.  Do you think I 
am being fair to him? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman I agree with your interpretation 
20 
but then there is a different interpretation that then says 
even in reviewing that process with Deneys Reitz the 
outcome could have been different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No but at this stage I just want us to 
stay with what we make of what he said to you that is Mr 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 85 of 247 
 
Gigaba. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I understood you to be saying you 
agree with my interpretation of what seems to be implied. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Of racism? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You agree with that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Just so that I have it 
clear in my mind he considered the sanction of dismissal too 
harsh, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  He did not choose those words, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well that was the note I took of your 
evidence. 
MR MKWANAZI:  No unfair was the word. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Because I was going to… 
MR MKWANAZI:  Unfair was the word. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Suggest to you. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  And therefore that is why as well when I 
briefed Deneys Reitz I briefed him on the basis of unfairness 
on two issues.  On the process itself which they came out 
and said it was fair.  And then on the sanction itself then 
they – they also created doubt in view of the fact that this 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 86 of 247 
 
thing was now going to the Transnet Bargaining Council. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright we will come to that.  Let me 
then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted to say I had also thought Mr 
Mkwanazi had used harsh or too harsh earlier on but I may 
be mistaken. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Let – let me explain where the harsh 
comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  When we were deliberating at board in 
10 
February or late January that is where the statement of 
harsh was coming from – from some other board members.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see… 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes that statement did come up. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi really what I wanted to 
put to you is that my note reflects that you said that Minister 
Gigaba said dismissal was too harsh and I wanted to put to 
you that that is precisely the basis upon which the board in a 
few months’ time reinstated him.  The minute says dismissal 
20 
was too harsh.  Is that just a coincidence? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Maybe but I am aware that the board – 
some members of the board did propose that and even the 
resolution of the board did capture such a statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Let me carry on with the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 87 of 247 
 
chronology.  So this is a meeting you had in October.  
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is some reference in the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh please do not forget. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you have in mind.  Let me go back to 
this issue of harsh.  Mr Mkwanazi – there can be no doubt 
can there by that Mr Gigaba must have thought that Mr – the 
10 
sanction of dismissal against Mr Gama was too harsh. 
MR MKWANAZI:  He might have thought that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because his – because the statement he 
made to you when he said whites commit more serious acts 
of misconduct and do not get dismissed.  In the context it 
could only have made that – he thought that dismissal was 
too harsh. 
MR MKWANAZI:  He did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree? 
MR MKWANAZI:  He thought that yes I agree. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Mkwanazi 
let us then move forward from October.  There is a statement 
in the papers that says that: 
“The new board commenced its duties on the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 88 of 247 
 
13 December 2010” 
MR MKWANAZI:  What page is that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am asking you to confirm that the 
new board commenced its duties on the 13 December 2010, 
is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Is it Bundle 4? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No I am asking you.  When did you 
commence your duties – the new board? 
MR MKWANAZI:  It could have been December 2010. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Or December 13. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It was actually December 10. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am not sure now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But somewhere in around December 10, 13 
or thereabout? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Middle of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The middle of December? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright now if you go to Bundle 2 can I 
ask you please to turn to page 24. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Can I go to Bundle 2?  Okay.  Page 24. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes that is the Public Protectors 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 89 of 247 
 
complaint. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Okay.  Page 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 24 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this complaint you receive really 
within a week or two of commencing your duties as the new 
chairperson, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  You made a 
10 
certain point about the use of the sanction being too harsh a 
few minutes ago.  I just want to follow up on that before you 
proceed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I forget.  Mr Mkwanazi Mr 
Myburgh just asked you a few minutes ago whether it was 
coincidental that you said earlier on that Mr Gigaba said the 
sanction of dismissal was too harsh and we know that later 
on you said no he said it was unfair.  But he was asking 
you… 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  It was unfair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:  To me he was questioning the unfairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you said that afterwards.  He was 
asking whether it was just coincidental that the board also 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 90 of 247 
 
used the same terminology.  You have responded to that I am 
not asking you to respond to that one.  I want to put this to 
you that…oh you want to say something? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  Say it. 
MR MKWANAZI:  No continue Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  No I want to say when I 
saw that paragraph 4.3.4 of your affidavit where you say – 
where you say – have you lost connection?  Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MKWANAZI:  No I am there Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I just want you to get settled.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Paragraph 4.3.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is the one we were use – we were 
referring to. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I have got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So where you said one of the issues that 
the Minister asked your board to look into was the issue of 
condonation processes in relation to procurement matters, 
20 
deviations and so on.   
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I found it interesting that one of 
the issues Mr Gigaba raised at that first meeting was this 
issue 
of 
condonation 
from 
deviation 
in 
procurement 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 91 of 247 
 
processes at Transnet.   And the basis on which the board 
ultimately reinstated Mr Gama was condonation as well.  Do 
you want to say something on that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman your analysis is correct. The 
basis was condonation and the fact that the matter now was 
going to the Transnet Bargaining Council and there was 
doubt whether we would win the case as it goes to the 
Bargaining Council.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what my context was here is Mr 
Gigaba meeting with you – the first meeting he has with you 
10 
where he offers you the position of Chairperson of the board 
of Transnet and conveys to you issues that he must have 
seen as issues of priority that your board should look at.  He 
raises this issue of condonation and of course you have now 
confirmed that he did discuss the Gama matter with you and 
then a few months later the board. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A few months later the board uses 
condonation to actually justify its decision to reinstate Mr 
Gama.  So there seems to be a connection in my mind 
20 
between 
his 
suggestion 
of 
condonation 
and 
the 
reinstatement.  You agree? 
MR MKWANAZI:  There is a link yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a link.  Okay thank you.  Mr 
Myburgh. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 92 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi I was going 
to take you to the Public Protectors letter addressed to you 
at page 2 Bundle 2 on the 22 December 2010 a week or two? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.  I have got it in front of me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  A week or two after you took up your 
position as the new chairperson.  I just wanted to… 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Confirm that in the second paragraph it 
reads: 
“The complaint alleged irregularities in procurement at 
10 
Transnet.  Further that the then Transnet board had unfairly 
conspired to prevent Mr Gama from successfully applying for 
the vacant post of Group Chief Executive which was about to 
vacated by Ms Maria Ramos.  In a meeting with him Mr 
Gama alleged that the motive for his suspension could only 
have been to scupper his chances of successfully applying 
for the post.” 
And then the following – and if you go over the page 25. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you look at Roman numeral iv  
20 
“That there existed internally a procedure for condoning 
exceeding limits in respect of transactions etcetera.” 
The very point that Mr Gigaba had raised with you, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I want to take you please to – 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 93 of 247 
 
sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to say something Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No, No Chairman nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I thought you – there was 
something you wanted to add.  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Now we know that you 
then appointed in the next year – early in the next year 
KPMG and Nkonki to investigate this complaint, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I take you please to Bundle 1 
10 
page 811, 811.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Bundle 1 page 800? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And 11.   
MR MKWANAZI:  I have got it here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now this is a letter from KPMG and 
Nkonki 
dated 
the 
12 
January 
2011 
setting 
out 
their 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just wait for me Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon I am so sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not received the bundle yet.  Yes 
20 
you may proceed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  This is a letter dated the 
12 January 2011 from KPMG and Nkonki where they set out 
their terms and conditions of engagement.  Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I see that. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 94 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now that letter is addressed to Mr 
Mapoma General Manager Legal Services.  If I could direct 
your attention to paragraph 1 it says: 
“Pursuant to our meeting on 11 January we confirm and 
thank you for requesting us etcetera.” 
Did you attend that meeting on the 11 January? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I co-signed that document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I know that. 
MR MKWANAZI:  My signature is at the bottom yes.  I do not 
recall if I attended it but I co-signed that document. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Might you have attended the initial 
briefing meeting 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes.  I do not recall the meeting. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what you presumably would agree 
is that you asked Mr Mapoma to assist you. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
With 
investigating 
the 
Public 
Protectors report, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that is presumably why he must 
20 
have at least have attended this meeting and then the letter 
setting out terms of engagement is sent to him.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  It is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can we go to the end of that document 
at page 820.  You confirm then that you ultimately signed 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 95 of 247 
 
this document. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  On the 24 January. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Mkwanazi Mr Mapoma agrees 
with you that you tasked him with assisting him with 
responding 
to 
the 
Public 
Protectors 
complaint 
and 
investigating it which related to Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  What Mr Mapoma says is that right 
10 
from the outset of his involvement in this project you told him 
that you had been instructed to reinstate Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not in that fashion.  The instruction was 
can you look at the fairness or unfairness of the Gama 
disciplinary. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So who told you to do that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That was my understanding in terms of the 
shareholder instruction.  It was not inviting.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Was that Mr Gigaba at the October 
meeting? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairperson.  That is 
correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So now we can add another paragraph 
to your affidavit? 
MR MKWANAZI:   You... I am not sure.  Can you continue? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 96 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, so far you have told the 
Chairperson – and these are critically important things. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So far you have told the Chairperson 
is that what we can add to your declaration is, that Mr 
Gigaba was of the view that Mr Gama’s dismissal was too 
harsh.   
 
Now, further questioning, what you say can be added to 
your affidavit is also that he asked you to review the 
dismissal of Mr Gama, correct? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure.  Is the fairness or 
unfairness.  Yes, correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Tell us what instruction he gave you, 
please. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think I touched on it a little bit in my 
opening remark in paragraph 1.3.4.  Is that, he felt that the 
disciplinary process on Gama was unfair based on his 
assumption that white executives who did similar offences 
were never dismissed but he did not have facts.  He was just 
questioning the unfairness.   
20 
 
So then, I took that request to look at unfairness to 
Siyabola(?), Mapoma and also to Deneys Reitz.  And also 
knowing 
very 
well 
that 
now 
there 
was 
this 
Transnet 
Bargaining Council.   
 
Yes, I did have a meeting with Deneys Reitz [poor 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 97 of 247 
 
connection 
– 
unclear] 
to 
look 
at 
that 
unfairness 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, please can you just 
focus on what I am asking you?   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You said just now that you were asked 
to review the dismissal of Mr Gama.   
MR MKWANAZI:   I would not call it a review but 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, how would you put it? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   ...as a view to review the fairness or 
unfairness of the dismissal. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, then you and I agree with one 
another.  So ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   [poor connection – unclear] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...Mr Gigaba asked you to do that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he was... his own view that it was 
unfair. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed Mr Myburgh.  You say 
Mr Mkwanazi he asked you to or he thought that he... he said 
that the process, the disciplinary process had been unfair 
but you say ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 98 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what he put, what he told you in support 
of that was how white executives were treated ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  He racialised it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he racialised, ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, as I see it, that has got nothing to do 
with the process as such.  Of course, he might have put it 
that way.  I, obviously, I was not there.  I do not know.   
 
So you know, a process really is about whether the 
procedure which was followed was fair.  That is the process.   
10 
 
But it seems to me that as if his complaint was that 
white executives were treated favourable, black executives 
were treated less favourable in relation to disciplinary 
matters, it went to the substance of the dismissal.   
 
You might be able to say yes.  You might not be able to 
say yes.  But I am just putting to you what... it looks like the 
reference to process might be a wrong terminology.   
MR MKWANAZI:   The reference to process? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because it is not about whether he 
was given a reasonable notice as to when the disciplinary 
20 
hearing will start.  It is not about whether he was given 
enough time to give his evidence at the hearing.   
 
It is not about whether he was given enough time to 
cross-examine witnesses who were implicating him.  It is not 
about whether he was allowed to call witnesses.  It is not 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 99 of 247 
 
about that.   
 
It is simply to say you are treating black executives less 
favourable compared to white executives when it comes to 
disciplinary matters. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, that is a good summary.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he asked you then to look into 
fairness of Mr Gama's dismissal, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you feel that you were at liberty to 
refuse that request? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Maybe not because at times, this could 
have been a shareholder instruction.  But then, that is why I 
had to follow a certain process to try and address his 
fairness or unfairness. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you construe it as a shareholder 
instruction, yes or no? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think it was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.   
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   But having said that.  You... we need to 
understand a certain technicality because he was not yet the 
minister or end of October.  I think he became minister 
1s t of November 2010.  Yes.  But I construed it as a 
shareholder request. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 100 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but he could have had another 
meeting with you if you wanted. 
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So now ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.  One second Mr Myburgh.  I had 
wanted to go back to that, the issue you have just touched 
upon, Mr Mkwanazi.  I wanted to ask you the question 
whether at the time you were meeting with him, your 
recollection is that you were meeting the... somebody who 
was Minister of Public Enterprises already ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I was under that impression, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is your recollection that ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I was under that impression, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were under that impression?  But 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Let 
me 
take 
you 
please 
to 
Mr Mapoma’s evidence.  Could you turn to Bundle 3? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And turn up page 30.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 30.  Yes, I am on page 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you met with Minister Gigaba in that 
October meeting, Mr Mkwanazi.  Are you able to remember 
whether he may have said to you that he had a meeting with 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 101 of 247 
 
Mr Gama or he had... or Mr Gama had discussed with him 
his matter?  Or is that something you do not remember? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not... I do not recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I wanted just to take you to what 
Mr Mapoma had to say at paragraph 8. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He says: 
“I mentioned in this regard that from the outset of 
my interactions with Mr Mkwanazi... 
10 
 
And we know that they were around the Public Protector 
report. 
“...he made it clear to me that he had been 
instructed to reinstate Mr Gama and that he wanted 
to find a way to do so cleanly.  Although I did not 
consider it my place to ask him who had instructed 
him, I assumed it must have been the former 
President Zuma.” 
 
Now do you agree or disagree with this statement? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I disagree with the statement in terms of a 
20 
few issues.  The word instructed is too strong a word.  The 
word that maybe would be appropriate to review the fairness 
of the Gama matter.  And also, the word to say that I assume 
that it must have been former President Zuma.  It is his 
assumption. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 102 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps I can add to that.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The Chairperson asked him, what 
actually what words did you use that caused him to infer 
that.  And he said that you said to him that it was an 
authority above the ministry.   
MR MKWANAZI:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or that the instruction came from higher 
up. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No.  Even if he had said that, I did not say 
10 
that.  And I do not operate... I do not name-drop, particularly 
President Zuma.  I do not name-drop that person because I 
have never met him, et cetera, et cetera.  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But well that bears out his version 
because you did not name-drop.  He says you did not.  You 
did not use the name. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I did not, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is a fact.  You understand? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I did not. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How would Mr Mapoma had got this so 
wrong?  I mean, he is a lawyer.  He is someone who you 
entrusted with responding to, it seems to me, the most 
important piece of work that landed on your desk literally 
immediately upon you becoming the chairperson. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 103 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You went out, you sought his advice 
and assistance.  You obviously thought of him highly.  How 
does he get this wrong? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, he got it completely wrong.  He really 
got it completely wrong. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I was close to Mr Mapoma.  Let me admit 
that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he did say that as well.  So that 
10 
you... the two of you ended up being quite close.  So he is 
right about that. 
MR MKWANAZI:   He is correct.  You need to understand the 
[poor connection – unclear] environment when that board 
came in.  We must have interacted as board with Mr Mapoma 
in a period of maybe three months on 40 to 50 legal matters.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And on all of these, we kept on working 
with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   And also requesting him to consult other 
lawyers to help us as a board to look into certain things.  
There were many, many matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And what is interesting as well.  For some 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 104 of 247 
 
reason, I do not have records of the January interactions 
that the board had with Mr Mapoma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And of course, [poor connection – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before Mr Myburgh continues.  I note 
that in paragraph 8, you did not take issue with Mr Mapoma’s 
statement where he said, you said you wanted to find a way 
to do so cleanly.  So you took issue with his use of the word 
10 
instructed.  And of course, his assumption that you had been 
instructed by former President Zuma.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you might have passed that part of 
saying:  I want to do this cleanly.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Let me indicate that the instruction was to 
review, not reinstate.  And also, the word cleanly is almost 
like legally.  Looking through the legalities of the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So where he says, you said 
you wanted to do this cleanly.  You have no problem with 
20 
that as long as it is understood that cleanly refers to 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Meant legally. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 105 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, we have 
seen that there was a meeting with KPMG ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you were... I was watching 
whether you are going to take this up.  Mr Mkwanazi, just 
now you also said what you were instructed to do was to 
review.  So I think that we can accept that you are saying 
whatever it is you were to do, it was a result of an 
10 
instruction.  Is that correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   The review, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So your query is.  It was not... 
it was not an instruction reinstate Mr Gama? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was instruction to review his case? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, I just want to ask you, 
why 
again, 
why 
did 
you 
not 
deal 
with 
this 
in 
your 
20 
declaration?  Because one of the questions you were asked 
to address was whether the settlement was influenced by 
any member of cabinet?  Do you not think it would have been 
necessary for you to explain? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is why I was indicating that there was 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 106 of 247 
 
a supplementary affidavit which I had prepared many weeks 
ago and it was sitting with my legal advisor so that they 
review it and I submit it.  I would have touched on those 
points there.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let us just deal with it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I take it that - and you must tell me if I 
misunderstand your evidence – I take it that as you give 
evidence today, you are able to answer that question which 
was in the letter from the Commission, by saying:  Yes, there 
10 
was ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   It... that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a member of cabinet influenced the 
settlement. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do want to submit... I still want to submit 
a supplementary affidavit which covers some of the points 
that I know I clearly had not addressed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   ...in terms of a memo I got on the 
28t h of July, if I recall. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I would like to do it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I understand that part.  I am just 
basically putting to you the question that was in the letter.  
Is there a cabinet member who influenced the settlement? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 107 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, not to my knowledge.  No.  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, in fact what you were asked Mr 
Mkwanazi is whether there was any member of cabinet who 
played any role directly or indirectly in the matter being 
settled? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja.  Thank you, Mr Myburgh. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, if you pose the question that way.  
Then definitely Mr Gigaba in my interaction with him end of 
October played the role that says:  Can you review this 
matter? 
 
But 
not 
necessarily 
the 
actual 
settlement 
10 
agreement.  No. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Then 
why 
did 
you, 
in 
fact 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   No ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I do not have anything. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you not put that in your 
declaration? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I did indicate that there is a 
20 
supplementary affidavit coming. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, but Mr Mkwanazi in your 
declaration you answered that question in the negative.  You 
cannot get out of this by saying you are going to put up 
another affidavit.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 108 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   In my declaration, I do indicate that I did 
meet Minister Gigaba on a certain date.  And also, in the 
declaration that you have, I did not address all the matters 
you raised in a memo of the 28t h of July.  I have got a draft.  
It is sitting with my lawyer right now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, I see that it is one 
o’clock.  If this is a convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Chairman. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Mr 
Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Advocate, I am here. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Good.  Just before lunch I was about 
to 
ask 
you, 
we 
have 
established 
that 
KPMG 
were 
approached on the 11 January 2011 …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Which bundle is it? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, no, no, it is not in any bundle, it 
is something we have been over.  You will remember that 
their 
engagement 
letter 
reflects 
that 
they 
were 
first 
approach on the 11 January 2011. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 109 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I just wanted to ask you, is did 
you approach Deneys Reitz and Mr Sbu Gule at about the 
same time?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I think so, just after, towards the end of 
the month. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Towards the end of what? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Of January. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say it was either at the same 
time or later in the month? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Later in the month, I think. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how did you come to appoint 
Sbu Gule from Deneys Reitz? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Do not forget that besides the KPMG 
report there were other reports that I was privileged to at 
the time.  That related to what you can call Transnet 
internal audit reports, one or two which I may not have 
right now.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you feel that you have answered 
my question? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Can you repeat? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did come to appoint Mr Sbu 
Gule of Deneys Reitz, why did you go to him? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh.  Let me explain it that when this 
matter started indicating that the matter must now go to 
the Transnet bargaining council, that was then but I only 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 110 of 247 
 
appointed Sbu Gule fairly late in January but that matter of 
this thing going to the Transnet bargaining council was 
already there as early as 2010 or October.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, really what I am 
getting at is this.  There are hundreds of attorneys in 
Johannesburg. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did you come to appoint Mr Sbu 
Gule of Deneys Reitz? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I must have advised by Mr Mapoma 
10 
because I roughly – I am aware that he was running with a 
big panel of lawyers that can do work at Transnet. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you must have been advised by 
Mr Mapoma? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  It is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, are you sure that you were not 
advised by Mr Mahlangu the special adviser to Minister 
Gigaba? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It could have been as well but I do not 
recall because my linkages on legal issues were always 
20 
with Mr Mapoma. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let me then take you please to 
bundle 1. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 1, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 170. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 111 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 170. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The affidavit starts at 169. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know Mr Mahlangu? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I know Mr Mahlangu. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You knew him as the special adviser 
to Minister Gigaba. 
MR MKWANAZI:   To the minister, that is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He says at page 170, paragraph 7. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “Due to the passage of time I  
cannot recall the exact reason for context of my 
discussion with MKWANAZI.  He conferred with me 
on a variety of matters in my capacity as special 
adviser to the Minister and in his capacity as 
Chairperson of Transnet on things that he needed 
me to convey to the Minister informally or prior to 
any formal process.  I recall that during my 
conversation with MKWANAZI, I advised that it was 
prudent for Transnet to seek legal advice on the 
20 
company’s 
proposed 
course 
of 
action. 
 
We 
discussed a few options on eminent labour lawyers 
that he could consult.  One of the names that came 
up is that of Mr Sbu Gule who at the time was a 
partner or director at Deneys Reitz, now Norton 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 112 of 247 
 
Rose. 
 
I 
offered 
suggestions 
because 
of 
my 
familiarity with the legal profession.  It all remained 
with the Chairman on how he intended to proceed.” 
Do you recall that discussion? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think it could have happened, that is 
correct, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we have here is the 
minister, as you put it, instructing you to undertake a 
review of Mr Gama’s case and you then landed up with the 
attorney 
suggested 
to 
you 
by 
the 
minister ’s 
special 
10 
adviser, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now what I want to then take you to 
is the chain of communication between the special adviser 
and Mr Gigaba.  Can you please turn to page 178? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the same bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of the same bundle, Mr Chairperson. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, 178, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is an email from Mr 
Mahlangu to Minister Gigaba. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the second bullet point says – 
and that email, Mr Mkwanazi, you would have seen is dated 
as early as the 18 January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 113 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The second bullet point says: 
“I understand that Transnet may be nearing a 
settlement with Gama.  I will obtain the details of 
the settlement and brief you accordingly. I suggest 
that you socialise the President and his key aides 
(formal and informal) on the proposed settlement . 
It is intended that the forthcoming board should 
consider and authorise it.” 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you were nearing settlement, 
10 
were you, as early as the 18 January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I would not call it settlement because 
first I would have had to go through a review. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, my attention 
was on some other page on another bundle.  Just remind 
me the page on this bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The page is 178, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   178? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of...? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of bundle 1, it is the second bullet 
point.  This special adviser, Mr Mkwanazi, reports to his 
boss, the minister, that he understands that Transnet is 
nearing a settlement with Gama on the 18 January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see what is written, yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 114 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you said you read from what 
bullet point? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The second bullet point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a very troubling email. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I know, I want you to answer to 
what he says. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, that statement is taking the matter 
ahead of where it was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where you [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR MKWANAZI:   The matter was maybe a week away from 
that date because the matter had to be dealt with by 
Deneys Reitz and Mapoma in terms of my understanding of 
what I was trying to do or what the instruction might have 
been to review. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, Mr Mahlangu says that 
20 
he had conversations and discussions with you.  Where 
would have got this from, if he did not get it from you? 
MR MKWANAZI:   He would have got it from me that the 
matter is going to be looked into by the firm and also by Mr 
Mapoma and the board. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 115 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he falsely reports to the 
minister? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja but that is just premature in my 
interpretation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes but it is a false report that he 
makes to the minister. 
MR MKWANAZI:   To a certain extent, as it stands here, it 
is premature.  He could have said that towards the end of 
January after I had interacted the external legal advice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, if it is premature then it is 
10 
false, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is false. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  Mr Mahlangu will come and give 
evidence on Monday. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then we will see what he has to 
say but certainly on the face of it what he reports to the 
minister is that you have already decided, have you not, to 
reinstate …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, we have not. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...to settle Mr Gama, even before 
you had approached your board., correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, we had not decided.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, when you say that what Mr 
Mahlangu says in that second bullet point was premature 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 116 of 247 
 
are you saying that what he says was the position at that 
time was not the position or are you saying it may have 
been the position or was the position but that was not the 
right time for him to start telling the minister about it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Do not forget even though we could have 
discussed a law firm, I could only do a law firm issue 
through Mr Mapoma and we only met with that law firm -
that briefed that law firm, if I am not mistaken, after that 
date.  So that is why I say his conclusion is seriously 
premature. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, Mr Mkwanazi, how could he just say 
to his minister, who is Minister of Public Enterprises and to 
the extent that you say the minister, Mr Gigaba, had 
instructed you to review Mr Gama’s case - to the extent 
that that is so or maybe so, then it would be likely that Mr 
Mahlangu would know about that.   
Now if he then reports to his minister on the 18 
January, that he understood that Transnet was nearing a 
settlement with Mr Gama and if that was not the position, 
why would he just get – decide to tell his minister 
20 
something that he had no basis for?  What would be his 
interest in telling the minister that he understood that a 
settlement was looming if actually …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was not in the …[intervenes] 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 117 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure – Chairman, I do not 
understand what Mahlangu was indicating.  Yes, he did 
suggest the law firms, Sbu Gule, and then I interacted with 
Mapoma because I do not deal with the law firm issues and 
a meeting was then set up between myself, Mapoma and 
that law firm to try and address this minister ’s instruction 
of was this process unfair.   
 
So yes, I did meet Sbu Gule but at a later date than 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And Mr Mahlangu himself, had you 
10 
had a discussion with him before this date about the Gama 
matter 
whether 
in 
a 
meeting 
or 
in 
a 
telephone 
conversation? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It could have been in a telephone 
because I got the recommendation of Sbu Gule as a 
specialist lawyer because already I was asking around.  So 
it could have been a few weeks before and then he 
suggested Sbu Gule and through that Mr Mapoma and 
myself approached Sbu Gule and we discussed the matter 
but that was far later than the 18 January. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what I am talking about, prior to 
the 18 January had you had any discussion with Mr 
Mahlangu 
whether 
in 
a 
meeting 
or 
in 
a 
telephone 
conversation about the Gama matter? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I might have. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 118 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Might have. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Because you need to understand the 
funny dynamic with these special advisers, they phone you 
any time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Did he phone you quite 
regularly, Mr Mahlangu, by any chance? 
MR MKWANAZI:   He did.  He did, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would he ask about Mr Gama’s 
matter sometimes? 
MR MKWANAZI:   And other matters, yes, he did. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, alright.  Thank you.  At the 
date of the 18 January, that is the date on which he was 
writing to the minister... 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, to his minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall whether you had done 
quite some homework on this Gama matter?  Remember, 
the minister had raised it with you for this first time in 
October of 2010?  We are now about mid-January.  Do you 
recall whether you had done quite some work to try and 
understand what the issues were and to form a view one 
20 
way or another as to whether this unfairness that the 
minister was talking about in October might be well-
founded or not?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, it is not what you would call 
legal 
work, 
it 
was 
requesting 
information 
in 
the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 119 of 247 
 
organisation about certain matters of procurement relating 
to what you can call not following processes of proper 
procurement and there were a couple of reports already in 
the organisation.  One was a 2008 report and it could have 
been 
another 
report 
which 
were 
addressing 
these 
procurement irregularities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You talk about reports that you had 
asked for and had reached you? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I asked for inside the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   And I did get at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And yes, I did have some reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And by that time you would have read 
some of them, some of those reports? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not in detail because they were fairly big 
reports, on average maybe 100 pages each and done by 
Transnet internal audit, so they were fairly detailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But they did articulate what you can call 
20 
procurement irregularities that had taken place not just – 
that one report I recall spoke to 2008 or was published in 
2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And the other could have been another 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 120 of 247 
 
report but I have asked for those reports, funny enough, 
recently, and nobody is giving me that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So do you recall whether by mid-
January you might have formed a view on your own on 
whether 
there 
was 
some 
unfairness 
on 
Mr 
Gama’s 
dismissal even if that was not based on legal advice, just 
for you own sense of fairness?  Do you remember whether 
you might have got to that point? 
MR MKWANAZI:   On the dismissal matter, as I indicate 
somewhere, I did not see any unfairness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But what I was looking for was were 
there similar things done in the organisation.  That is why 
that report talks to Transnet procurement – the title is 
irregular Transnet procurement of officer in time period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:   So it was more on the irregular 
procurement issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not on the unfairness of the dismissal, 
20 
etcetera, etcetera, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, perhaps I 
can just ask you again, I mean, is it possible that Mr 
Mahlangu could have just made this up?  I mean, how?  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 121 of 247 
 
Very strange. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure, hopefully he will answer.  
He is coming next week and he will answer.  But yes, he 
did advise me to talk to Sbu Gule and I discussed that with 
Mr [indistinct] 20.23 Maponya(?) and we met with Sbu Gule 
at a particular time and we discussed various things with 
Sbu Gule.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, you are very good at 
camouflaging and talking about things that are not related 
to my question.  It would be very strange behaviour, would 
10 
it not be, for a special adviser to make up something and 
report it to his minister.  It would, would it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I cannot talk for Mr Mahlangu. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But yes, we met regularly, we spoke over 
the phone. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, let us move on to something 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one sec before you move on, Mr 
Myburgh.  Mr Mkwanazi, I asked you about ten minutes ago 
20 
about 
whether 
Mr 
Mahlangu 
did 
regularly 
call 
you 
…[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether he discussed Mr Gama’s 
matter and you said yes, you did.  Now Mr Mapoma gave 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 122 of 247 
 
evidence and said that Mr Mahlangu did also call him about 
the Gama matter. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he said he called him twice.  He 
said in the first telephone conversation he was not 
pressurising him to do anything but he was enquiring about 
progress in the Gama matter. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he says when he called him for the 
second time, Mr Mahlangu was definitely putting pressure 
10 
on him saying that Transnet was delaying or he, Mr 
Mahlangu, was delaying the reinstatement of Mr Gama or 
the settlement, I am not sure, but he said he put pressure 
on him and he had to be firm with him and tell him that he 
must stop doing that.  He was not reporting to him or the 
minister and he says he reported this to you, I do not know 
whether the following morning, because he suspected that 
Mr Mahlangu might tell the minister and the minister might 
call you.   Do you recall him have mentioned – or having 
received any calls from Mr Mahlangu about the Gama 
20 
matter? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, in terms of advice which legal firm 
to look into as one of the legal firms which advice I then 
discussed with Mr Mapoma and Mapoma then set up a 
meeting for me to meet Deneys Reitz or something, yes. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 123 of 247 
 
But I do not recall Mr Mahlangu giving me feedback that he 
has spoken to Mapoma, I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, not Mr Mahlangu.  My 
question was whether you have any recollection of Mr 
Mapoma reporting to you or mentioning to you that Mr 
Mahlangu had called him about the Gama matter and they 
are trying to put pressure on him and he had to talk firmly 
to him. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Mr Mapoma might have said so, I do not 
recall. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not recall, okay, alright. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But yes, I did speak to Mr Mapoma 
actually once every two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   During conversation, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I then wanted to move onto – so this 
is on the 18 January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us move to the 21 January and 
20 
could I ask you please to go file 3. 
MR MKWANAZI:   File? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   File 3, page 105. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 3, okay.  I have got it, what 
page? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 124 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   105. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay, I have got that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you see towards the foot of the 
page it is an email from Mr Selinga to Mr Todd at Bowman 
Gilfillan.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in summary what Mr Todd is 
told, if you go over the page at 106.  106 says: 
10 
“I confirm that the Acting Group Chief Executive and 
Chairman of the board of Transnet, Mr Mkwanazi, 
has instructed as follows: 
1. That any sale in execution of the shares or any 
property belonging to Mr Gama attached pursuant 
to the aforementioned warrant of execution be 
cancelled forthwith.” 
That was the warrant of execution for the costs in the High 
Court.  And: 
2. That 
the 
shares 
or 
any 
property 
attached 
20 
pursuant 
to 
the 
aforesaid 
be 
immediately 
released on judicial attachment. 
3. That the warrant of execution issued in this 
matter 
be 
held 
in 
abeyance 
until 
further 
instructions.” 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 125 of 247 
 
And then under that: 
“Regarding Mr Gama’s appeal…” 
Which is really the bargaining council arbitration. 
“…against the decision of the disciplinary hearing 
that is set down for hearing before the bargaining 
council on Monday the 24 t h, your instructions are to 
postpone the matter sine die, to allow negotiations 
between the parties to run their course.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I see that. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So here on Friday the 21 January 
you put a halt to Transnet recovering its costs in terms of a 
High Court order.  Why?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I did instruct Selinga in view of the fact 
that I wanted to entertain this meeting with this other 
company to look at the matter of this unfairness that was 
raised by the shareholder.  That is why I did – just to put a 
stop into it until Deneys Reitz and others have looked into 
this matter.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Mkwanazi, this – the High 
20 
Court litigation preceded the disciplinary hearing and the 
dismissal.  And there was a court order which was being 
executed in favour of Transnet. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why on earth would you want to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 126 of 247 
 
become involved in that and put a stop to that?  It was 
money that was owed to Transnet. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I did but I wanted to exploit almost 
the shareholder instruction of is this unfair, etcetera, and 
in view of time I had not yet met Deneys Reitz to look into 
that matter.  Yes, I did request that [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you did this – if I understand 
your evidence correctly, in acquitting yourself of the 
shareholder instruction, that is what you have said, 
10 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Can you repeat? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have said that you put a stop to 
this …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in so doing you acquitted 
yourself of the shareholder instruction. 
MR MKWANAZI:   To review the unfairness or fairness of 
that process, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But the shareholder instruction 
20 
related to Mr Gama’s dismissal at a disciplinary hearing, 
this is High Court proceedings that were engaged in a year 
before where Mr Gama lost comprehensively and then 
sought leave to appeal and that was refused but somehow 
you found it to be your place to put this on hold. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 127 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I did put it on hold, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you consult with your board or 
did you feel comfortable in taking this decision? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I felt comfortable in taking this decision, 
I did not consult with the board on that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So – and you also then put a stop to 
the arbitration which was going to happen on the Monday 
the 24 t h. 
MR MKWANAZI:   To postpone, yes.  It has not put a stop 
to postpone so that I review this request of unfairness or 
10 
whatever it was, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But what I do not understand is a 
professional body was going to undertake an arbitration 
and rule on that very question within a few days, why did 
you allow that to happen? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I needed to be satisfied in addressing 
what I called that shareholder request of looking to the 
unfairness of that process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Mkwanazi if it was unfair then 
the arbitrator would have ruled on it. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes there was this new request which 
was saying please look into the unfairness or fairness of 
this process and in order to do that I have got to consult 
some legal opinion or firm and unfortunately the calendar 
of events were such that my consultation could only take 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 128 of 247 
 
place towards the end of the month so that is why I had to 
request 
that 
they 
stop 
these 
processes 
until 
I 
had 
consulted Deneys Reitz. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Alright well that was on the 
Friday and we can see that you were busy because on the 
Saturday you then engaged in a negotiation with Mr Gama 
didn’t you, you wasted little time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that Mr Myburgh can I just 
go back to the issue of stopping the execution.  Mr 
Mkwanazi the process that you instructed Bowman Gilfillan 
10 
Attorneys to stop that is the process of recovering from Mr 
Gama legal costs that the High Court had ordered him to 
pay to Transnet, that process could not possibly have 
anything to do with whether Mr Gama’s dismissal was fair 
or not.  That was – that order which was made in favour of 
Transnet by a High Court Judge was an order made 
because the High Court concluded that when Mr Gama 
launched an application to the High Court seeking a certain 
order against Transnet and the directors he had no proper 
grounds he had no case, that is why the High Court 
20 
dismissed his application and ordered him to pay costs in 
favour of Transnet and its directors.  That was an 
application which happened before the disciplinary hearing 
began.  
 
So I cannot see how it could have had any bearing 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 129 of 247 
 
on whether his dismissal was fair or not.  Are you able to 
see that it could have had some bearing? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman I understand what you are 
saying and there is – but then from my looking at the Gama 
matter and maybe looking at some elements of his contract 
of employment I don’t know if it is linked but yes I 
understand your interpretation of the court judgment yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, of course maybe in your favour 
I can say that at this stage we are talking about what 
seems to have been an instruction to temporarily stop that 
10 
process so that might – well maybe up to a certain level 
one can understand if you said I didn’t understand what is 
going on, maybe let it stop, but when you later on then 
don’t say continue that is what we will deal with in due 
course.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  So that is the Friday, 
let’s go to the Saturday.  Could I ask you please to turn to 
Bundle 2. 
COUNSEL FOR MR MKWANAZI:   Excuse me Chair before 
...[indistinct – audio faulty] five minute comfort break just 
20 
to help ourselves.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the reception is very poor when you 
speak Mr Mkwanazi, the lawyer. 
COUNSEL FOR MR MKWANAZI:  Oh I see Chair apologies 
for that ...[indistinct] I was just asking for a five minute 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 130 of 247 
 
comfort break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I cannot hear, I hear you are asking 
for something but I don’t hear what it is you are asking for. 
COUNSEL FOR MR MKWANAZI:   ...[Indistinct] five minute 
indulgence, a comfort break if possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you asking for a break? 
COUNSEL FOR MR MKWANAZI:   five minute comfort 
break Chair yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a five minute break, okay we 
will take a five minute adjournment, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...page 3 of Bundle 2. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Wait Bundle 2, can we go back. Sorry 
bundle 2, I believe this is the one  yes.  Yes I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a consultation note of your 
attorneys. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of a meeting held at nine o’clock on 
Saturday the 22 n d of January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 2 says Temba Langa and 
Siyabonga Gama were also in attendance but we initiated a 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 131 of 247 
 
caucus meeting Sibo, Mr Mapoma, Mr Mkwanazi and 
myself, myself being Sibo Sangoli, do you recall attending 
this meeting? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The next paragraph says during the 
course of that discussion Mr Mapoma confirmed that the 
proposal that had been made from the company, which had 
been rejected still stands.  There is no counter proposal, 
so even by this time, the 22 n d of January, already a 
proposal had been made, is that right? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well maybe Mr Mhlangu wasn’t 
wrong with what he said to the Minister on the 18 t h of 
January. 
MR MKWANAZI:   He was ahead of himself ja, on the 18 t h 
of January. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well when was the first proposal 
made? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not recall.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well it would have been before 
20 
Saturday the 22 n d of January, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It looks like it would have been but truly 
I do not recall, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. And what was the first 
proposal? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 132 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry just so that I understand it, 
you were the lead negotiator in these negotiations? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I was the lead negotiator yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right so you can’t tell us what your 
opening gambit was? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not recall no, I do not recall, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us go to the next paragraph 
then Mr Mkwanazi.   
“Mr Mkwanazi explained that he would like to assist 
10 
Mr Gama where reasonably possible.” 
Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I see that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why would you want to do that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   My assumption was that again based on 
what I called the shareholder view was there an unfairness 
in the Gama matter, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But why would you want to assist the 
man where reasonably possible.  This is a – Mr Mkwanazi 
this is a Chief Executive of Transnet Freight Rail that had 
20 
been fired and his arbitration was supposed to have been 
the forthcoming Monday.   You have a meeting with him on 
the Saturday and you tell him I want to assist you where – 
or you say to your lawyers that you want to assist Mr Gama 
where reasonably possible.  Why? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 133 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Don’t forget yes I did indicate that 
because also deep down in me there was an element of 
doubt on if – not of the sanction, not of the guilty or not 
guilty, or not guilty, that is fair, but of the sanction in view 
of the fact that by that time if I recall, and unfortunately 
these reports are still not available, there were many other 
cases where similar procurement irregularities were not 
even investigated, some they didn’t even bother to apply 
for condonation, so that is the issue, the angle I was 
coming from. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see, well we are going to come to 
your description as you put it in inverted commas similar 
irregularities in a moment.  But let’s go on to see what you 
say.  So you say ja there was information out there and 
that was your point of departure but then you say what’s 
reported his intention, that being  yours, is to bring him 
back into his, the Chairman’s, office.  He wants Mr Gama 
to assist  him in a number of strategic issues.  Did you say 
that? 
MR MKWANAZI:    I think I did.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright and then you say: 
“He however needs a good motivation to do so.” 
Did you say that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I did ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it says: 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 134 of 247 
 
“His view is that if he is provided with an opinion 
setting out that there was some unfairness towards 
Mr Gama at the board meeting on 16 February he 
would persuade the other members to make a 
decision to bring him back into the organisation.” 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is an astonishing statement to 
make, give me an opinion that shows some unfairness and 
I will use that to persuade my fellow board members on 16 
February to bring him back.   You said that. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That suggests Mr Mkwanazi that at that 
time you had come to the conclusion that if at all possible 
you would like to bring Mr Gama back to Transnet, is that 
fair comment to say that – that looks like that was your 
attitude.    
MR MKWANAZI:   That was my attitude which needed 
support from a legal perspective that these were the 
unfairness, not the dismissal issue but the unfairness of 
the whole process of other executives not even being 
20 
warned, things just happened and things were forgotten for 
years and years on end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you did not think that he had been 
unfairly found guilty of the acts of misconduct of which he 
was found guilty, you had no problem with that. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 135 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   The process was extremely fair, I don’t 
have a problem with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The process was also fair. 
MR MKWANAZI:   On the facts in relation to the charges of 
which he was found guilty is the position that you accepted 
that dismissal was appropriate, the only thing that made 
you to want to bring him back was simply these other cases 
of other people, or is the position that you thought that the 
sanction of dismissal given the acts of misconduct of which 
he had been found guilty was too harsh irrespective of 
10 
what had happened to other people, or is the position that 
had there been no such other cases that you are talking 
about you would have had no problem with the sanction of 
dismissal for an executive found guilty of this? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree with you fully Chairman, it is a 
strange situation in that here is this individual, I don’t 
know how many managers were there, maybe at the time 
maybe 2 000 managers who a few others like him had done 
similar things, not even a warning for years and years and 
then here comes this individual who does something similar 
20 
to what other managers have done and this particular – it 
was a question of consistency in that my interpretation was 
in that organisation there was no consistency at the time.  
Had there been similar cases which had been handled the 
same way as the Gama matter I would have had no 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 136 of 247 
 
problem whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so save for these other cases you 
were comfortable that Mr Gama’s sanction of dismissal was 
fair? 
MR MKWANAZI:   From the individual handling of the 
matter it was fair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja.  Okay Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am going to come to what you keep 
saying similar cases, but you said now if there was similar 
cases to Mr Gama I would have had no problem at all, do 
10 
you remember saying that, do you remember just saying 
that now?      
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I do but ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me give you an example of 
...[intervenes]   
MR MKWANAZI:   But let me ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi please let me finish.  
Two cases that were similar were Van der Meller and 
Khanya.  You needn’t look around.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember the two employees 
20 
who worked under Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we talked about them earlier. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh no I do remember, but now that is 
why at some stage I would like the Commission to call in 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 137 of 247 
 
KPMG to present the report that I saw because in that 
report they spoke to 22 other individuals where nothing 
was done, I do agree that those are two individuals I 
agree, but I am saying what about the other 22 or more 
who were not dismissed or even a warning given against. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Myburgh asked you earlier before 
lunch the question if you saw that some of the employees 
had been dismissed just like Mr Gama, but you realised 
that there were others who had not been dismissed, why is 
it that your attitude was not to say then the others the ones 
10 
who were not dismissed should also be dismissed, should 
also be dismissed because it is wrong that they were not 
dismissed for such a thing.  Why was your attitude that we 
must condone these serious acts of misconduct and allow 
Mr Gama back?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman I did make a few examples of 
these big condonements, one was an increase in contract 
price from R980million to R1.8billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, sorry, ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   One was an increase ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mkwanazi I am sorry, I 
think my use of the word condone is going to confuse you, 
let me rephrase my question.    
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh’s question before lunch one 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 138 of 247 
 
of his questions was if you realised that in some cases 
dismissals had been effected but in others no dismissals 
had happened and indeed I think you say in some not even 
a warning, but in ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Gama’s case there was a dismissal 
and there were some where there may have been a 
dismissal.  Why didn’t you say what is wrong here is 
Transnet’s failure to dismiss these other employees, that is 
what is wrong.  What is wrong is not its dismissal of Mr 
10 
Gama, what is wrong is its failure to dismiss the others 
because what they were guilty of was serious. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman I cannot fault your argument, 
you are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Could 
you please Mr Mkwanazi go over the page to page 4, and 
there at paragraph 5 at the top it is recorded that he [being 
you] was to discuss the details of such return to Transnet 
with Mr Gama in a one-on-one meeting to be held between 
20 
them.   Now we see that there is reference on more than 
one occasion to you holding one-on-one meetings, right, 
why did you not have other people present at meetings, 
negotiations with Mr Gama.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Let me indicate that yes there were 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 139 of 247 
 
these one on ones, for some reason unknown to me Mr 
Gama was not comfortable to be in meetings with other 
people except myself and of course even in those one-on-
one meetings we – me and Mr Gama didn’t agree on a lot 
of issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you go on to say in that 
paragraph: 
“There are details however that he is unfamiliar 
with, such as when Mr Gama was fired, when Mr 
Gama was suspended and the like ...” 
10 
You didn’t even know that, correct?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman let me – you know at times 
when you start a meeting you want some background 
information 
from 
the 
people 
who 
are 
presenting 
the 
information to you, so it was part of that, I knew what is 
happening but almost like sketch the background of this 
situation to me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi you paint a picture that 
you had actually considered this matter, you were about to 
reinstate the man yet you didn’t even know when he had 
20 
been fired or suspended.     
MR MKWANAZI:   I had a good idea. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well it didn’t matter did it really 
because you were going to reinstate him no matter what.  
You smile?  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 140 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now tell me ...[intervenes]   
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What is not included there you don’t 
ask the questions what was he dismissed for.  Did you 
know what Mr Gama was dismissed for? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes Advocate, Chairman I knew. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well explain to us please. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is the GNS contract where he 
exceeded his authority in terms of a confining this thing to 
10 
GNS when it should have gone out on open tender and also 
he exceeded his delegated authority on such matters.  If I 
recall his authority allowed him to only contract up to 
R10million and if I recall that contract was close to 
R90million, but the time it was terminated. 
 
Then 
the 
other 
matter 
was 
the 
Fifty-like-new 
locomotives where a Board decision was taken that the 
refurbishment of these fifty like new locomotives would be 
done by  Transnet Engineering, and then he and I don’t 
know who else decided that it would be done by an outside 
20 
company which somehow from where I set it introduces 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure because that company 
must then set itself up when Transnet Engineering has got 
all the infrastructure to handle a refurbishment of the 50 
like new, those were the two occasions.  Then of course 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 141 of 247 
 
the third one was this issue of attacking his colleagues.  
Now let me just continue a little bit, if this was an isolated 
case and all other cases in the company were handled in a 
similar fashion I would have dismissed as well. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you had other cases where a 
CEO had besmirched the Board of Transnet? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, not really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say not really?  
MR MKWANAZI:   No not really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Have you had any? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   No when I saw other cases not related to 
the gravity of the offence but just related to the fact that he 
exceeded, he has done a lot of irregular things in those 
things.   Now I am saying if it was a norm at Transnet to 
discipline people in that fashion not the two ...[indistinct] 
and the other, all the others from say 2005 to discipline 
them, to get rid of them, to do whatever I would have had 
no problem of Gama being dismissed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi what about the third 
charge which had nothing to do with tender irregularities, 
20 
contractual 
irregularities 
and 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
condonation.   It is very spurious isn’t it, the third charge if 
you actually know what happened.  I mean you have had 
the benefit of listening to Mr Todd. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No I have got an idea of the third charge 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 142 of 247 
 
as 
well, 
where 
he 
publically 
started 
attacking 
other 
executives. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:     Yes.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you agreed ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is unacceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think and the Board ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   And the Board, that is unacceptable. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I need to deal with that if you don’t 
mind, if you just give me a second. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well while Mr Myburgh is looking for 
something let me go back to an issue that he has dealt 
with, with regard to one on one meetings between yourself 
and Mr Gama, how many such meetings did you have with 
Mr Gama? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I wouldn’t know, that you would have to 
ask Mr Mapoma because whenever I would meet, I never 
met Mr Gama alone outside of these meetings, so I will 
have to ask Mr Mapoma because for some reason I would 
insist that Mr Mapoma comes with me to such meetings, I 
20 
don’t know how many meetings we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well he – I have been under the 
impression when I read his statement that there had been 
two such occasions but when he gave his evidence he said 
no there was only one, namely he said the Inanda one, I 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 143 of 247 
 
think which I think is when Deneys Reitz Attorneys were 
also 
present. 
 
Is 
it 
your 
recollection 
also 
that 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Then that’s the meeting yes, I wouldn’t 
have met him even socially I wouldn’t have met him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now when Mr Myburgh asked you 
why you excluded other people from that meeting and met 
Mr Gama alone you say that it was Mr Gama who had 
discomfort in meeting with you together with other people, 
is that correct? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he had asked that he wanted to meet 
you alone? 
MR MKWANAZI:   He did ask and I did agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ever ask him why he did not 
want even your lawyers to be present.  I don’t understand 
what should make him uncomfortable because you have 
lawyers to advise you, he has got lawyers to advise him, if 
you are going to talk settlements both of you need legal 
advice, so why should they not be present?  Did you ask 
20 
him? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No I did not, no I did not ask him but 
what I sense there, I am now assuming, there was a lot of 
media leakage around Transnet issues at that time and 
what I suspect maybe he was trying to do was to limit the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 144 of 247 
 
media leakage of some of these discussions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but really if you negotiate the 
settlements in a legal dispute that is happening in a public 
forum like a Bargaining Council I am not sure that you 
would be so concerned about that, because in any event 
you know you hold your discussions until you sign there is 
no settlement.  I just find it strange that there were these, 
there was this one on one meeting, particularly when the 
attorneys were around and you needed advice, I take it he 
needed advice, his attorneys were around as well.  I mean 
10 
what is it that was so secret that he wanted to talk about. 
That is my ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairperson I do not know because even 
my feedback to those meetings were actually feedback on 
what could  have been discussed or what options are 
there, etcetera, etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Well maybe Mr Myburgh is 
still going to ask you further about the content of the 
discussion but I heard from Mr Mapoma that you reported 
to him after that one on one meeting with Mr Gama that the 
20 
two of you could not reach agreement, because Mr Gama 
instead of asking to be reinstated in the position from 
which he was dismissed actually wanted you to agree that 
he would be appointed to the position of Group Chief 
Executive Officer of Transnet, is that true?  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 145 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I suspend that – let me check – I 
suspect that Mr Mapoma might have got his facts wrong 
there, because that position of Transnet Group Chief 
Executive was a position where there was a parallel 
process to interview etcetera, etcetera, so I suspect what 
Mr Mapoma might have meant is a position of Chief 
Executive Transnet Freight Rail, I suspect that is what he 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well no I don’t think he confused that 
because when he gave evidence he was clear because I 
10 
even said – asked him, I said but Mr Gama had been 
dismissed from the position of CEO of TFR. 
MR MKWANAZI:   You did sir I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and he said yes but he – he said but 
Mr Mkwanazi told me that the reason why they didn’t agree 
is that he was now, he now wanted to be appointed as – or 
he used the word reinstated, reinstated as Group Chief 
Executive Officer and Mr Mkwanazi said he rejected that, 
he wanted him to be reinstated to the position of CEO TFR, 
which is the position from which he had been dismissed, 
20 
that is what he said. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Well Mr Mapoma said that and I suspect 
Mr Gama might have said that but clearly Chairman I could 
never agree to a position like that.   I know in actual fact I 
was looking at agreeing to something more etcetera, 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 146 of 247 
 
etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, so is the position that you are 
not sure whether Mr Gama made this demand to be 
appointed to ...[intervenes]   
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree Chair I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure okay, alright. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But I would not have agreed to it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes about that you are clear. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, no Chairman I couldn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you chair.  Mr Mkwanazi can I 
take you please back to Bundle 4A, your affidavit, page 18.  
4A, 18, one eight. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I on page 17, page 18.  I am on 
page 18 Chairman. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    If you will just bear with us for a 
second. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am just getting there.   Yes Mr 
Myburgh.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So it is paragraph 9.4, you have 
20 
already confirmed this, but I just want to pick up what I 
said I needed to just look at carefully.  You say at 9.4 I 
personally fully agree with the disciplinary processes and 
findings of the then Transnet Board, presumably you’re 
talking about the findings of the disciplinary inquiry, 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 147 of 247 
 
correct?   
MR MKWANAZI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    So you fully agree, the only 
difficulty I have is that there was this common process in 
Transnet Systems called condonation, that was your only 
problem as you put it, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can I then ask you please to turn to 
Bundle 3.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 3? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, page 88. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No this is Bundle 1, what bundle is that, 
this is Bundle 2, this is Bundle 3, yes I have got that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Page 88.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   88. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay I have got it, okay.  I am on page 
88. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you see the last third of the page 
there is a paragraph number 60.  
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just above that there’s a quotation.  
This is the finding of the Chairperson of the disciplinary 
hearing on the third charge the besmirchment charge, and I 
want to take you one, two, three, four lines down in the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 148 of 247 
 
middle of the page, are you with me, there is a sentence 
saying “this charge”. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes can I – I am on page 88 above 
paragraph 60. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, there is a quote, let me read 
the whole paragraph.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, I see that line, I see that line yes, 
this charge. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This charge - says the Chairperson – 
now you agree with this, goes to the heart of Trans ... 
10 
...[intervenes]   
MR MKWANAZI:   This charge?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This charge, being the third charge. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    
“Goes to the heart of Transnet’s loss of faith in Mr 
Gama and there can be no doubt that dismissal is 
the only appropriate penalty for Gama’s conduct 
under this ...” 
It’s actually the 4 t h charge, you agree with that? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  I agree with that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it has got nothing to do – 
condonation has no bearing on this, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I agree with that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well then I do not understand on what 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 149 of 247 
 
possible basis you could have reinstated Mr Gama?  On your 
own version you are agreeing that the only appropriate 
penalty for the fourth charge is dismissal.  Your only problem 
is there is this thing called condonation that has no bearing 
on this charge Mr Mkwanazi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Advocate Myburgh you are spot on but 
there is a – it is a consequential thing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well I hope so. 
MR MKWANAZI:  In my interpretation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  In – it is consequential thing that came 
about because of the first two main charges.  But I agree 
with that sentiment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But then why did you reinstate him?  
Because your only problem was condonation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What Mr Myburgh is saying. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you were – when you were looking at 
20 
this issue you and the board and you sought to rely on 
condonation. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Mr Gama was not afforded the 
opportunity of using condonation.  That could only apply to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 150 of 247 
 
the other charges not this one.  So that being the case you 
ought to have said as the board, you see this idea that Mr 
Gama was not afforded condonation – the opportunity to use 
condonation is not good enough to justify reinstating him.  
Because that ground only applies to two of the acts of 
misconduct of which he has been found guilty.  It cannot 
apply to this third one.   
And yet this third one is on its own so serious that a 
dismissal is appropriate.  Therefore you as the board ought 
to have said no we cannot find our way to reinstating Mr 
10 
Gama because even if we were to use condonation there is 
this other act of misconduct to which condonation does not 
apply and it is an obstacle to us reinstating him.   
That is what Mr Myburgh is putting to you.  Why did 
you not adopt that approach? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman my interpretation of the two main 
charges the GNS and Fifty like new. They then lead to this 
inappropriate behaviour by this executive and therefore I – 
that is why my focus was on the first two key charges and 
because if then the first two had been dealt with in a 
20 
particular route the third charge might not have arisen.  That 
is where I come from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do have some questions Mr – but I want 
to allow you Mr Myburgh to take it further. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Very well.  Mr Mkwanazi you have 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 151 of 247 
 
agreed – firstly let me debunk this.  There is not two main 
charges in this case.  There are three.  And you have agreed 
that the only appropriate penalty for the third charge – it was 
actually the fourth charge was dismissal.  You have accepted 
that.  And you have accepted that condonation has no 
bearing on that.  I think you driven to concede that the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama just on that basis was a 
monumental failure of judgment on your part. Is that not so? 
MR MKWANAZI:  On the last point. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The reinstatement. 
MR MKWANAZI:  On this unbecoming behaviour. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The reinstatement of Mr Gama was a 
monumental failure of judgment on your part.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  On the last matter but on the other two 
matters there is ground to indicate that there could have 
been grounds for a different view in terms of the fairness of 
the system in handling the Fifty like new and the GNS 
contract.  But on the matter of how he then dealt with the 
20 
executives and the board I agree my board did not apply a – 
a lot of – what you can call attention to that matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well sorry that is being a bit generous.  
You applied zero attention.  Because your – Mr Mkwanazi let 
us call a spade a spade.  Because you were acting on 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 152 of 247 
 
instructions.  You just did what the shareholder Minister told 
you to do.  That can be the only possible explanation 
because how else could you have just left out of account this 
critical fourth charge without having being grossly negligent 
in acquitting yourself of your duties.  How? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am not sure if – it is an oversight 
Advocate Myburgh but there was no focus on that third 
charge it is an oversight. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you – would you simply accept 
please that you erred in reinstating Mr Gama then? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not fully but in dealing with the third 
matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He should not have been reinstated. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  He should not have been reinstated, 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Advocate Myburgh that is your view. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I am asking you. 
MR MKWANAZI:  The question – do not forget now that after 
taking the ill-advise from this firm who then told witnesses in 
20 
our case at Transnet Bargaining Council and we then had 
doubt as the board that we could actually win this matter at 
Transnet Bargaining Council therefore we opted to – to 
settle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mkwanazi which attorneys poked holes 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 153 of 247 
 
into your case in the Transnet Bargaining Council?  Because 
Bowman Gilfillan said you had a very strong case.  I 
understand that Webber Wentzel said procedurally you had 
done everything properly and I have seen – I have seen a 
letter or letters from Deneys Reitz who said in relation to 
whether the dismissal was fair or not who say they also gave 
an opinion that this dismissal was fair.  So which attorneys 
poked holes into your case that was going to arbitration? 
MR MKWANAZI:  They created doubt Chairman.  Maybe I 
used the – a strong word.  It comprehensive Deneys Reitz 
10 
legal opinion post the first summary one which had been 
given to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think Mr Myburgh might take that… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That further but let me go back to this 
question.  I am concerned that you do not seem to be 
prepared to make the concession that I think Mr Myburgh 
thought you would make namely that the board should not 
have reinstated Mr Gama.  Is my understanding of your 
position correct?  Namely your stand is… 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct my stand is that board 
applied its mind and it saw some elements of doubt that it 
would win at Bargaining Council and then took a decision to 
settle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Now my difficulty with that 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 154 of 247 
 
evidence is this.  Mr Gama was found guilty of three acts of 
misconduct and I think you and I agree that each one of 
those acts of misconduct were serious – or was serious.  I 
think we agree on that.  I think previously you have agreed 
to that, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Ja that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You have also agreed or conceded to 
Mr Myburgh that the – the charge relating to the attacks by 
Mr Gama on the executives and the board was serious 
enough to deserve the sanction of dismissal on its own.  You 
10 
remember that?   
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you accepted that.  Now if you accept 
that what it means is that the chairperson of the inquiry 
relied on three grounds to say Mr Gama should be 
dismissed.  Now two of these grounds namely the acts of 
misconduct had something to do with procurement which is 
where condonation may apply okay?   
But 
this 
other 
one 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
with 
procurement and therefore condonation would not come in.  
20 
Why would you and your board not say, but why must we 
reinstate Mr Gama when there is this one ground, one 
conviction if you like which on its own is sufficiently serious 
to justify the sanction of dismissal?   
Why must we take him back because we cannot – we 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 155 of 247 
 
cannot fault the chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry for 
having concluded that he should be dismissed even if it was 
this act of misconduct alone?  Why do you not adopt that 
approach?  That is the approach I would have expected from 
a board or from somebody who says this third charge or 
fourth charge that has got nothing to do with procurement is 
sufficiently – or is serious enough on its own to justify 
dismissal.   
So that is what my logic would say.  So you – you 
would – I would go back to the Minister – I would go back to 
10 
Mr Gama and say you may have had a case on the basis of 
the two serious acts of misconduct that are connected with 
procurement if those were the only acts of misconduct of 
which Mr Gama was found guilty maybe we could have done 
something.   
But the problem is that there is third one which has 
got nothing to do with condonation and procurement and in 
our view it is sufficiently serious to justify dismissal 
therefore we cannot take him back on the basis of this third 
one.  What do you say?  Is that not logical? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman I understand where you come 
from.  Now if you take the issue a little bit back that yes 
there were four charges.  Yes the fourth one was this one of 
unbecoming behaviour by the executive. But then if you look 
at it from perspective that says what created that charge are 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 156 of 247 
 
the first two charges which related to [00:14:04].  That is my 
argument or they say as you deal with those two maybe the 
other one falls away.  That is my argument ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
MR MKWANAZI:  But I agree with your analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but Mr Mkwanazi maybe remotely you 
could apply that reasoning if you took the view that the 
board and the executives who were attacked by Mr Gama 
had something wrong.   
But at the time when you were dealing with this 
10 
matter you knew that even Mr Gama had admitted that he 
had been properly found guilty of these acts of misconduct 
relating to procurement.  Therefore his attacks on the board 
for – and on the executives for pursuing him for misconduct 
was unjustified.   
That is the reasoning that I would have expected 
from you and the board.  To say when – once you realised 
that this other charge had nothing to do with procurement 
you say but he is admitting that he is guilty.  So he was 
attacking these executives and the board for pursuing 
20 
charges of misconduct against him saying that this was part 
of an agenda.  He has now admitted that there was no such.  
He has now admitted that he was guilty.   
They had proper grounds to pursue him.  So actually 
the fact that by now he was admitting that the – he was 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 157 of 247 
 
guilty makes his attacks on them even more serious.  
Because he is now admitting in effect that these people were 
doing their jobs.  So therefore he should never have 
attacked them.  Do you not agree with that reasoning? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I agree with your analysis Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  I was at page 4 of… 
MR MKWANAZI: Of which bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Of Bundle 2.  You then said at 
paragraph 6. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Once you are clear on those details … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please wait for me Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 4 of Bundle. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bundle 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2.  I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  Just to maybe 
complete what we were discussing Mr Mkwanazi.  On this 
reasoning that I was articulating to you it would therefore 
seem to me that it would not have been right and it was not 
20 
right – it would not have been right to say we will reinstate 
Mr Mkwanazi – Mr Gama nevertheless because even though 
there is this charge of which he has been found guilty which 
has got nothing to do with procurement when you look at the 
situation in the way I am articulating.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 158 of 247 
 
It would seem to me that that should lead you to say 
no but we cannot really take him back because the fact that 
he admits guilt does not mitigate the situation.  It makes it 
worse because he attacked people for doing their job and did 
so publicly.  You understand? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I understand Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Mkwanazi at page 4 paragraph 6 
it is recorded that once he – that is you is clear on those 
details about when he was fired, when he was suspended 
10 
and the like he being you can then formulate a proposal. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if you drop down to 
paragraph 14 of the consultation note at the foot of the page 
it would appear that Mr Gama and Mr Langa do not take 
issue with the fact that Mr Gama is guilty of the complaints 
as charged all they intend to challenge is the sanction that 
was imposed.  That you knew, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at page 5 paragraph 16. 
20 
“At that point the caucus ended so that Mr 
Mkwanazi could meet alone with Mr Gama.” 
MR MKWANAZI:  On page 5? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  So you could meet alone with 
him. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 159 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  Right I see it.  I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I would like to take you please to 
File of Bundle 3. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And to page 107.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Page 107.  I am there.  Now Mr Mkwanazi I 
take it that you – you knew that Bowman Gilfillan were 
representing you and Transnet in the Gama litigation, you 
knew that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I knew that. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon? 
MR MKWANAZI:  When you say in the Gama litigation – this 
matter? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well in the Gama arbitration as you 
call it an appeal. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You knew that. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am not sure if I knew that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MKWANAZI:  All I knew – yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You issued an instruction. 
MR 
MKWANAZI: 
 
I 
knew 
that 
Bowman 
Gilfillan 
are 
representing us in this Transnet Bargaining process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Bargaining Council. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Which has [00:21:28]. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 160 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you understood that Bowman 
Gilfillan were representing you in the Gama disciplinary – 
sorry Gama dismissal arbitration.  The one that was 
supposed to be held on Monday the 24t h you knew that. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I am not sure if I knew that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well that is astonishing.  Who were 
you asking for help from? 
MR MKWANAZI:  From Bowman Gilfillan. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No I am saying when you [00:22:00] on 
the screen.  Are you suggesting to us… 
MR MKWANAZI:  No, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let us decide who is going to... 
MR MKWANAZI:  No I am on my own here.  There are two 
sort of matters.  If I recall Bowman Gilfillan are representing 
us on the Transnet Bargaining Council matter of Gama. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes they are. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  Okay.  So that was not too 
20 
difficult.   
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH SC:  And 
you 
know that they 
also 
represented you during the disciplinary hearing.  You would 
have even a little investigation would have shown that, 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 161 of 247 
 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you knew that that disciplinary 
hearing presumably you would have come to learn went on 
for a very long time. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct but do not forget that 
disciplinary hearing would have taken place maybe some six 
to eight months before. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And I was not there then and my – that is 
10 
why engagement with them starts in January when this 
matter is being prepared. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  For the Transnet Bargaining Council 
process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you knew as well that Bowman 
Gilfillan had engaged a very pre-eminent senior counsel.  
Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I do not know – ja is it Mr Todd? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You knew that the attorney was Mr 
20 
Todd? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You watched him on TV the whole of 
yesterday. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes I saw him yes.  He is a good attorney. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 162 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you knew that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Todd from Bowman Gilfillan and 
his senior counsel were steeped in this case, correct?  They 
had worked on it for a very long time, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But you never so much as picked up 
the phone and asked Mr Todd for his advice on your 
prospects of success, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  No I did not. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I suppose why you did not do so is 
quite obvious. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I do not know. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well why did you not phone him? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems the – it seems… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Can I suggest to you why you did not? 
MR MKWANAZI:  When you say it is quite obvious? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let me tell you why you did not 
because he would have told you that you were going to win 
the case.  Correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  I hear where you coming from yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You did not want to hear that did you 
Mr Mkwanazi?  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Not really no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes well precisely. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 163 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  My interpretation of Bowman Gilfillan – by 
the way I never saw their correspondence prior to – to 
maybe the beginning of January 2010.  So yes they would 
have been corresponding with my Group Legal but from 
where I sat I almost wanted a new pair of eyes to look into 
this matter as if getting to the Transnet Bargaining Council 
process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right so let us… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not understand that Mr Mkwanazi.  
Please help me understand that.  I do not understand that.  
10 
You come to an organisation for purposes of being part of 
the board.  You are new in this organisation.  I know that 
previously you had been I think Group CEO and so on. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But for purposes of being part of the board 
you are new.  You come at a time when there is a matter that 
the Minister tells you about on the first occasion he meets 
with you and offers you to the position of chairperson of the 
board.  So it is obvious an important matter and he wants 
you – instructs you to review it.  That means you must go 
20 
into it and see whether you know there was fairness or not 
okay? 
MR MKWANAZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the organisation has been using this 
particular law firm.  This law firm has been handling this 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 164 of 247 
 
matter 
over 
the 
previous 
two 
years 
or 
so 
from 
the 
disciplinary hearing they had represented Transnet even in 
the high court application which they won. They succeeded.  
It means even in the disciplinary hearing they represented 
Transnet successfully.   
They won because Mr Gama was found guilty of three 
serious acts of misconduct and was dismissed.  So these are 
attorneys or this is a legal team which you must have got to 
know had won the high court application for Transnet that Mr 
Gama had brought against Transnet.   
10 
2. Had won the disciplinary hearing.  So they served 
your organisation well.  Now you want to understand whether 
there was some unfairness.  You do not want to talk to them?  
You just wanted to get another law firm on what grounds?  
When you have not – they have not said anything you do not 
like.   
They – they have not performed anything badly.  On 
the contrary they have done very well for Transnet. But you 
do not want even to talk to them.  You want to go to another 
law firm.  I do not understand that. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  Chairman that is the decision we took at 
the time and in my interpretation we needed almost a 
different set of eyes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you change a winning team?  This 
is a winning team. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 165 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  I remain saying that we needed a different 
pair of eyes on this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But.. 
MR MKWANAZI:  And yes Mr Gule or Deneys Reitz or 
whatever they are called ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you had had a discussion with this 
law firm which had been so successful with his legal team – 
if you had had a discussion with them and through the 
discussion you felt that they advises may be on some of the 
issues on which you sought advice were not satisfactory I 
10 
would understand wanting to say let me hear somebody else.  
But I have difficulty understanding the logic where you do 
not - had not even discussed with them and yet they have 
been successful.  You understand where I am coming from? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I hear where you are coming from Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It does seem to me conduct that is 
difficult to explain.  As I say, if you have had a meeting with 
them and you have said:   
 
Just brief me on this matter because you people have 
20 
been handling it for a long time and I see that the 
disciplinary hearing, you handled it very well on the face of 
it, at least.  The high court application, you have handled it 
very well.  The...  
 
You were busy seeking to recover for Transnet costs.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 166 of 247 
 
And I think it was about R 426 000,00 that ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...Mr Gama owed costs.  They were 
pursuing that.  It looks like they were doing right.  So if you 
had met with them that briefed you and you had raised 
certain questions and through that discussion when you felt 
that, you know, you wanted another perspective because you 
are now taken with their perspective.   
 
That I could maybe understand but you did not talk to 
them.  You did not write to them, other than saying:  Stop the 
10 
execution, the recovery and postpone the arbitration.   
 
So just have that difficulty.   
MR MKWANAZI:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not even saying other than that 
you wanted a different ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   A different set of eyes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the truth is.  Mr Mkwanazi, I put 
to you.  That you wanted someone to give you some friendly 
legal advice which you could use the board meeting on the 
20 
16t h of February to persuade your fellow board members to 
take back Mr Gama.   
 
That is actually what happened, is it not?   You wanted 
friendly legal advice.  That is what the consultation note in 
effect says.  Correct? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 167 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Is says that, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, precisely.  So because you 
wanted friendly legal advice, the last person you would go to 
is to Mr Todd who was going to tell you as it was that you 
had very good prospects of success of winning Mr Gama’s 
arbitration.  That you did not want to hear, correct?  That 
would not help you ...[intervenes]    
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really but yes I did want a different set 
of eyes to look into this matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  So let us have a look then at 
10 
Bundle 3, page 107. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Could it be that you wanted a law firm or 
an attorney who could you that there was some unfairness in 
this dismissal?  Because Mr Todd had prepared an opinion or 
a report which he sent to, I think Ms Senamela or 
Mr Senamela to pass onto you to where he made it clear 
that, in effect, Transnet had a very strong case in the 
20 
arbitration. 
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it... could it be that you were looking for 
somebody who would tell you that there was unfairness in 
this dismissal. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 168 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair, you are heading in the right 
direction because even though the facts are not as clear as 
the time of these discussion but I think they do begin to 
indicate that maybe the sanction of dismissal who was 
inappropriate.   
 
And I think that law firm, Deneys Reitz, does begin to 
indicate that there is risk of us losing this case if we take it 
to Transnet Bargaining Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  So let us go onto 
10 
Bowman Gilfillan’s letter, dated the 24t h of January at page 
107. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And just to fast-forward.  Let us go to 
108 and to paragraph ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 108? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  To paragraph 3.3. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“The legal team representing Transnet and the 
20 
Bargaining 
Council 
Arbitration 
including 
senior 
counsel is satisfied that even on Mr Gama’s own 
version, it is likely that the sanction of dismissal will 
be upheld as fair with the three separate charges of 
misconduct of which he has now admitted to guilt. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 169 of 247 
 
The chairperson of the inquiry who reached this 
conclusion, is a highly respect senior counsel and 
labour arbitrator who was initially proposed as 
arbitrator by Mr Gama and whose integrity has never 
been called into question.” 
 
3.4: 
“In addition, Transnet and his legal team are aware 
of and are ready to present in the Bargaining 
Council Arbitration further facts and circumstances 
that show that Mr Gama’s current version is false in 
10 
material respects. 
This significantly aggravates the seriousness of the 
misconduct and makes it more likely still that the 
Bargaining Council arbitrator will find Mr Gama’s 
dismissal to have been fair.” 
 
And then at paragraph 5, Mr Selinga was expressly 
asked to bring this letter to your attention.  Presumable he 
did so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I think he did Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So here you know, the legal 
20 
team 
representing 
Transnet 
at 
the 
Bargaining 
Council 
Arbitration including senior counsel is satisfied that you are 
going to win, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That was not music to your ears.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 170 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  It could not have been music in 
your ears Mr Mkwanazi.  Could it have been? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, Chairman maybe not but do not forget, 
the brief is different to what Bowman Gilfillan did.  The brief 
is:  Look at the unfairness of fairness of that process and the 
sanction.  It is a different brief.   
 
I suspect, Bowman Gilfillan would have stayed on this 
road and yet, a different...  
 
That is why a different set of eyes is useful to say:  
10 
Please, look into this.  Was it unfair in terms of the process?  
It was fair.  Was it unfair in terms of a sanction and look into 
it in terms of other similar case matters?   
 
So this other... the other firm, Deneys Reitz, were not 
requested to do the same thing that Bowman Gilfillan had 
done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you know Mr Mkwanazi.  By this 
time, you would have known... well, you knew that the 
chairperson of the disciplinary inquiry who had come to the 
conclusion that Mr Gama was guilty of these three serious 
20 
acts of misconduct and who had concluded that each one of 
these three serious acts of misconduct would have justified 
dismissal on its own, was a senior counsel.   
 
You would have known that.  Actually, this letter says so 
and says:  An experienced senior counsel and arbitrator. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 171 of 247 
 
 
Now this letter tells you that Transnet’s legal team that 
Mr Todd is talking about includes a senior counsel.  And he 
says, they too are of the opinion that Transnet has a strong 
case.   
 
So you already have those.  They are saying the same 
thing.  Why do you still want to look for somebody who says 
something else?   
MR MKWANAZI:   It is a different set of eyes on this at the 
particular time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is like Mr Mkwanazi, you and the board 
10 
were bending over backwards to try and accommodate 
Mr Gama.  It is not like you were looking at the matter 
objectively.  It is like you were bending over backwards to 
accommodate Mr Gama.  Or maybe to accommodate the 
shareholder minister’s inclination because he had already 
said that, you know, the dismissal was unfair.  That is how it 
comes across.  You want to comment on that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, Chairman.  That is how it comes 
across as well.  I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree?  Okay alright.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, then let me then deal with 
something else that happened on the 24 t h of January.  Just 
to place in context.  Could I ask you please ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Which? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...to go to File 4, Bundle 4? 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 172 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 4. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 6 of your affidavit or your 
declaration. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 6, Bundle 4.  [poor connection – 
unclear]  Wait.  Six...  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairman, I am told there is a 
technical problem and we need to break for a while.  Is that 
right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us... is there an indication how long it 
might take? 
10 
TECHNICIAN:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Fifteen? 
TECHNICIAN:   Ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten.  Okay we have to adjourn because 
apparently there is some technical problem.  Mr Mkwanazi, 
we will adjourn and the technicians will tell us once the 
problem has been addressed.  We adjourn. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Thank you, Chairman.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mkwanazi, I want to 
take you to, please, to Bundle 4, page 6, part of your 
declaration. 
MR MKWANAZI:   H’m?  Page 6... [poor connection – 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 173 of 247 
 
unclear]  Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see that at paragraph 6.1, you 
make reference there to KPMG and Nkonki.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then the next sentence says: 
“The first report was done quickly as the information 
was historical.” 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“It is that first report that was used by the board in 
10 
its deliberations.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, could I ask you then to turn 
please to Bundle 2? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 2.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you turn up please page 380?  
These are pages who would have been inserted earlier 
today. 
MR MKWANAZI:   380? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Three, eight, zero. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Are you there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the Commission made a request 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 174 of 247 
 
for information on KPMG and then issued a summons in 
order to obtain the various reports. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the reports at KPMG produced... 
we know they produced a final report in November.  That is 
attached to your declaration.  They produced two other 
reports.  The Progress Report on the 24t h of January.   
 
That you will find at pages 380 running through to 400.  
And then they produced, and this is referred to in your letter 
to the Public Protector which we will come to in a moment.   
10 
 
They produced an Interim Report at page 401 dated the 
26t h of April 2011.  So a Progress Report, 24 July.  Oh, sorry 
24 January.  An Interim Report, 26 April and then a Final 
Report in November. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you say in your declaration that 
the first report was done quickly and it is this report that was 
used by the board.  Presumable, you must be referring to the 
report of 24 January? 
MR MKWANAZI:   A report, they had done a report by then.  
20 
But looking at what I am seeing here ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It looks likes it was not on the 
24t h of January.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that is my very point. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 175 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what was the first report that was 
used by the board in its deliberations?  Because this report 
would not have helped it.  It is progress report that sets out 
the mechanics and the manner in which KPMG and Nkonki is 
going to set about their task.   
MR MKWANAZI:   My understanding, besides this report 
there was another report on Transnet’s irregularities which is 
dated 2008 which I had at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, I think you might be 
10 
confusing yourself. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The paragraph that I have read to you, 
says that it was the first report of KPMG and Nkonki. 
 
You know that ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   No, no.  Ja, it is a long time ago, by the 
way, in terms of whatever we are talking about.  It is now 
nine years or so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And I truly thought that this report here... 
20 
by the way, I have never had this report.  I only saw it today. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I thought that this report from page 401 
was actually published before the end of January.  Yes, I 
thought that. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 176 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that is completely wrong.  You 
referred to this report in your letter to the Public Protector 
and that is in June.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Wait.  To the first ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja... I am sorry.  I am sorry, Mr Mkwanazi.  
I am sorry.  I think you ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you are on the same page up to a 
certain 
point.  Mr 
Mkwanazi, 
you must tell me if I 
misunderstand.  I seem to understand you to see, you 
10 
concede that the board could not have had this Interim 
Report which starts at page 401.  It could not have 
deliberated on that in making the decision whether to 
reinstate Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I concede, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You concede that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Because I have never... I am seeing this 
for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the first time, yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But I was under... yes.  I was under the 
20 
impression that there was a report towards the end of 
January 2011.  And besides, there was another report from 
Transnet Internal Audit which I had at the time which talked 
about the so-called 30 individuals who had done various 
things.  Ja, but even that, I do not have. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 177 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no, no.  Let us take it step-by-step.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you concede that this is not the 
report that you ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the board could have deliberated upon 
in making the decision to reinstate Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the Interim Report. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that your affidavit at page... 
paragraph 6.1 talks about an Interim Report of KPMG which 
might suggest it is this report. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that one.  What the affidavit 
says, cannot be correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is not correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Then Mr Myburgh, you want 
20 
to take it from there? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Then you talked about an 
Internal Audit Report that you say you had.  That is the one 
attached to your affidavit, correct?  Is that ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   No, it is not there.  It was... it is called 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 178 of 247 
 
The 
Procurement 
Irregularities 
at 
TCP 
Procurement 
Irregularities at TFR, et cetera.  It is a report around the 
2008.  I still do not have that report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes but that was not before the board.  
So what we ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I had the report. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I had the report then. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we do agree upon is that, as of 
the 16t h of February – and we are going to come to that 
board meeting. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The 16t h of February the board did not 
have any report from KPMG/Nkonki.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  I agree with you.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now I want to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the board as at the 16t h of February, 
have any report before it at all which talked about how any 
20 
employees had been dealt with in terms of deviations or non-
compliance procurement procedures? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, there was a report.  For some 
reason, it has disappeared, the one I am talking to.  Its title 
could have been Transnet... No.  Transnet Irregularities by 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 179 of 247 
 
Transnet Internal Audit done in two thousand - actually, two 
reports – done in 2008 and then there is another report. 
 
Now for whatever reason, those two reports are missing. 
And at the time, if you recall, there was this supply of a lot 
of information to my office by the organisation.  So I do 
recall having seen one or two of these reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, I understand your evidence 
insofar as it says you were aware of such reports, one or 
two.  Or you were in possession of such reports.  But are 
you sure that those reports or one of them, those reports 
10 
were or one of those reports was before the board at the 
meeting of the 16t h of February? 
MR MKWANAZI:   My recollection, there was a report tabled 
to 
support 
certain 
statistics 
of 
allegations 
and 
condonements, et cetera, et cetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I hope somebody could just [poor 
connection – unclear] that report.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall whether, if there was such a 
report before the board, it did deal with the facts of those 
20 
other cases in order to be able to compare like with like in 
regard to Mr Gama?  Because it cannot be useful to just look 
at any case where there was non-compliance. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Each case has to depend on its own 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 180 of 247 
 
merits, is it not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, you are correct.  If that report 
would not have compared... would not have listed this cases 
in comparison to Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR 
MKWANAZI: 
 
 
But 
it 
would 
have 
listed 
similar 
irregularities, the quantum of the condonements, et cetera, 
et cetera.  It does not refer two reports, yes.  Without 
referring to Mr Gama.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay Mr Myburgh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, we are lucky because we have 
got affidavits from many of your fellow directors and we will 
see in time what they say.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But let us start with the board meeting 
of the 25t h of January just to follow the chronology.  If you 
please go to 51. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Five, one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of Bundle 1 and to page 534. 
MR MKWANAZI:   534...  Page 543? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   543.  That is part of the minutes of a 
board meeting on the 25t h of January 2011.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Five, three, four... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you could please ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   534.  Okay.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 181 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Go to paragraph 4.1.6.   
MR MKWANAZI:   One point six... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is says the chairman, which is 
you: 
“The chairman stated that he was currently occupied 
with more than 30 cases with similar allegations to 
those levelled against Mr Gama.   
He indicated that there was evidence that there is a 
culture of condonation of exceeding delegative 
authority within the company.” 
10 
 
So yes, that is what you said. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you gave no documents to your 
fellow directors.  You told them that, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   There was.  That is why I then... Also, I 
find it interesting that I get this minute today.  I have never 
had it.  That is why then, I am keen to get... what date was 
this thing?  [poor connection – unclear]   
 
I am keen to actually get those reports by Transnet 
Group Internal Audit.  It was two reports.   
20 
 
And I do recall that I based my 30 cases or so, which 
were not identical to Gama’s because those cases never 
dealt with [poor connection – unclear], et cetera.  Those 
cases were dealing more with procurement issues. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  But the point that I make Mr 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 182 of 247 
 
Mkwanazi is that you did not give your fellow directors any 
documents.  You simply told them that you are occupied with 
these 30 cases, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Call it a... on paragraph 41.4, there was 
this document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Procurement Irregularities at Transnet.  
There was another document as well.  But it is this document 
that I thought the board have had sight of.  Where now I was 
talking to this list of 30 similar cases, if I could use the word. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then you could please go to 
paragraph 4.1.8?  Because I want to come to an important 
meeting ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   But not hundred percent similar. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, 4.1.8 ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   4.1.8.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“The chairman assured the board that the company 
was cooperating fully with the Public Protector.   
He informed the board that he had a discussion with 
20 
Mr Gama on 22 January on a proposed settlement 
agreement.” 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“He advised the board that the matter will be 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 183 of 247 
 
deliberated on, that the Corporate Governance and 
Nominations Committee and then recommend to the 
board for approval on 16 February.” 
 
So that was the route to the 16 February meeting.  First 
a meeting of the GCNC on the 3 r d of February, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us go then to that meeting.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Which meeting? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The meeting of the Corporate 
Governance 
and 
Nominations 
Committee 
on 
the 
10 
3rd of February.  Sorry, before I do that.  There are a few 
things I need to deal with.  There was another board meeting 
after the 25t h of January.  It was on the 1s t of February. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  What is its page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me just take you there.  Sorry, just 
give me a second.  Those minutes are at 916 of the same 
file.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 916? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   916.  Not 8916, I think.  916. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  And then if you could forward to 
918.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you have a look at paragraph 
4.1.10 towards the top of the page. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 184 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“The chairman stated that he was in settlement 
discussions with Mr Gama.  He stated that Mr Gama 
was only appealing the sentence that was imposed.  
He 
added 
that 
the 
committee 
was 
currently 
reviewing Mr Gama’s sentence and the proposed 
settlement agreement will be presented to the board 
for approval  on 16 February 2011.” 
 
Now, what committee are you referring to there? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   It would be... first, I suspect the Corporate 
Governance. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Right. 
 
So 
that 
is 
on 
the 
1s t of February. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now we know that something very 
important happened on the 2 nd of February. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that is, Mr Todd... Sorry, is there 
something ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Paragraph?  What paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not referring to ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   918? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am off that document Mr Mkwanazi.  
Perhaps you can just concentrate on my question, please.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 185 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  One second, Mr Myburgh.  Mr 
Mkwanazi? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh just read from paragraph 
4.1.10 at page 981. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think arising from that, he has a 
question for you. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   My question was.  What committee are 
you referring to there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It would have been the Corporate 
Governance to then come back to the board. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay thank you.  So Mr Mkwanazi, 
that is on the 1s t of February.  I now want to move to the 
2n d of February.  I am off that minute now. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  On the 2 nd of February, 
20 
Mr Todd produced his report.  You have seen that report? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could we please go to Bundle 3? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 3.  I do not have this, the previous 
minute.  Bundle 3?  [witness in conversation with another 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 186 of 247 
 
party] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page... 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 3, page 16? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page... 
MR MKWANAZI:   16? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   65. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Oh, page 65.  Okay.  Keep the notes of 
that bundle of that meeting.  [witness in conversation with 
another party]  65, yes? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I take it you received a copy of this 
10 
report? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I think I did.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, what you mean you think you 
did? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So you will see that it expands 
from 65 all the way through to 90.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Twenty-five pages of the report, 
correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A very comprehensive and detailed 
report. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This also was not music to your ears 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 187 of 247 
 
because at this point in time, you were opposed to 
reinstating Mr Gama, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   [poor connection – unclear] Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  Did you ever read this report? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   H’m.  And what impression did you 
gain?  Was this a report of a competent attorney, someone 
who obviously who had a handle on the matter? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it was.  It was.  It was, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Was there anything missing from this 
10 
report that you ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   It is comprehensive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is all there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you read this report, did it leave 
any room to conclude that you were going to actually lose 
the arbitration? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, but then that did not stop me from 
getting a second opinion on it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Which is why then I approached [poor 
connection – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you note that last paragraph Mr 
Mkwanazi on page 90, namely paragraph ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I did Chair. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 188 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 90, same page? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 67.4. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where Mr Todd says: 
“There would have to be compelling reasons not to 
abide by the outcome of a properly constituted 
disciplinary 
inquiry 
and 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
Bargaining Council Arbitration mechanism that is 
prescribed by law to determine a dispute about the 
10 
fairness of a dismissal.” 
 
You ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I read that paragraph as well.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Having read that, would you accept that, 
at least what these attorney was telling Transnet and the 
board was, the outcome of the disciplinary inquiry is one that 
is fully justified and to do anything to undo that, you would 
need very compelling reasons.  Is that how you understood 
20 
it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  So that is on the 
2n d of February.  I now want to come to the meeting of the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 189 of 247 
 
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on the 
3rd of February. 
MR MKWANAZI:   What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I would like you please to go back to 
Bundle 1 and to turn up page 827. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Can you help me with Bundle 1?  [witness 
in conversation with another party]  Okay.  Page 827? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR MKWANAZI:   [witness in conversation with another 
party]  Yes, I see this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, those are minutes of the meeting of 
the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee on 
3 February 2011. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now Mr Mkwanazi, you were 
the chairperson of that committee? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The other members were Ms Nyaka, 
Ms Tshepe and Mr Shaba, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we see under partial attendance, 
Mr Mapoma was present, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if you go to page 828 over the 
page, you will see there is a heading. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 190 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Turn over the page.  [witness in 
conversation with another party] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   It is 808. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, over the page, please. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You will see there is a heading, 6.7, 
report back from the advert process.  I mean, what was 
happening here is the position, the vacant position of 
Transnet GCE was being advertised. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you would accept that much of 
this meeting was dedicated to whether or not Mr Gama 
should be allowed to put forward an application. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Or for his application to be 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we could then please go to page 
830? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And there at paragraph 6.9 about 
halfway down, investigation by the Public Protector. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 191 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“Mr Mapoma took the committee through senior 
counsel’s opinion that was obtained with regard to 
Mr Gama’s application for the GCE position.  He 
highlighted that the legal opinion was based on the 
following three issues. 
1. Does the guilty verdict against Mr Gama exclude 
him from being considered in the current GCE 
selection process underway? 
10 
2. How does the pending appeal decision affect the 
board decision to interview or not? 
3. Does the Public Protector complaint currently 
being dealt with have a bearing on the selection 
process?” 
 
Do you confirm that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then the sub-paragraph: 
“Mr Mapoma informed the committee that senior 
counsel’s opinion was that Mr Gama should not be 
20 
excluded from the current GCE selection process.  
Ms Tshepe indicated that senior counsel’s opinion 
was not the same as the lawyers’ opinion. 
She stated that the general rule was that, in terms 
of 
Clause 
4.8.4 
of 
the 
company’s 
recruitment 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 192 of 247 
 
procedure, the company may deviate from the policy 
if there are exceptional circumstances that warrant a 
deviation.” 
 
Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then I am going to come back to 
that opinion and that clause. 
“Mr Mapoma further took the committee through the 
proposed 
settlement 
agreement 
between 
the 
company and Gama, stated that there was no 
10 
agreement on the following issues, the date of 
reinstatement, the position to which Mr Gama would 
be reinstated, et cetera.” 
 
So essential to the business of this committee on the 
3rd of February was this issue of Clause 4.8.4 of the 
recruitment policy, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now could I ask you please to now 
turn to Bundle 2?  Keep this bundle open where you are at 
file or Bundle 1 but then open as well ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Bundle 2, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 2. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Bundle 2.  What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page... let us first go to page 302.   
MR MKWANAZI:   302...  [poor connection – unclear] 302.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 193 of 247 
 
302, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Are you there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is the recruitment and 
selection policy.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let me take you to... no doubt you 
are familiar with this.  Let me take you please to Clause 
4.8.4 at page 307. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It says that at 483, just above that: 
“When determining whether a person is suitable 
qualified for a job, steps must be taken to determine 
whether...” 
 
And then it sets it out.  And then 4.8.4.: 
“The candidate must not have been previously 
dismissed from Transnet or reasons relating to 
incapacity or misconduct.” 
 
Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And of course, the problem was that 
Mr Gama had been dismissed for conduct, right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the issue that then arose before 
the committee is whether one could depart from 4.8.4 on the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 194 of 247 
 
basis of Clause 2.  And Clause 2 you will find at page 304. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Three, zero, four? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Three, zero, four. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I see Clause 2. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Under the heading scope. 
“This 
policy 
applies 
to 
all 
job 
applicants 
and 
employees of Transnet.  Transnet may, however, at 
its sole discretion deviate from the policy where 
necessary in respect of executive appointments.” 
So that was really the debate.  Do you remember that? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Yes, I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Mapoma in his report to the 
committee, as we have seen, spoke of a senior counsel’s 
opinion.  Let me take you to that opinion.  You find that at 
page 293 of the same bundle. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Of the same, 293.  I have got this, yes.  
293, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we go to paragraph 13 at page 
297. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see it. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Counsel said: 
“However, clause 2 of the recruitment procedure 
provides that Transnet may at its sole discretion 
deviate from the policy where necessary.” 
The next paragraph: 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 195 of 247 
 
“However, the discretion to deviate from clause 
4.8.4 is not an unconstrained one.  This discretion 
must be exercised after consideration of all the 
relevant 
circumstances. 
 
Furthermore, 
since 
Transnet is an organ of state, decisions taken by 
Transnet 
are 
exercises 
of 
public 
power 
and 
therefore 
need 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
minimum 
threshold of rationality.  This requires a rational 
connection between the decision taken and the 
reasons given for it.”  
10 
Do you see that?  And then if I could take you please to 
paragraph 19, over the page, one nine.  Are you there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I am there but there is a problem 
with the system.  It keeps dropping. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I am there, I am on page – you said 
297? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   298. 
MR MKWANAZI:   298. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 19. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am there, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Counsel said: 
“A crucial fact to be taken into account in exercise 
of this discretion is Mr Gama’s failure during the 
arbitration proceedings to challenge the findings of 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 196 of 247 
 
misconduct made against him by Entrobus(?) SC.  
By not challenging these factual findings Mr Gama 
impliedly 
concedes 
that 
he 
was 
guilty 
of 
misconduct.  It may well not be rational for Transnet 
to interview a candidate who has conceded to 
having misconducted himself in carrying out of his 
duties as Chief Executive.” 
Do you see that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I see it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   May well not be rational. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would you agree with that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  So let us then have a look at 
the decision of your committee. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay, that is file …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   For that you need to go to 
…[intervenes] 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   File 1. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To bundle 1, yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I can please …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 830. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 197 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   …direct your attention – yes, we 
have looked at 830, I would like to go 831. 
MR MKWANAZI:   There is a problem with sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Can you hear me now? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Can you hear? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you hear me now? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I cannot hear Advocate Myburgh.  I can 
hear the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I am not speaking.  Can you 
10 
hear me? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Advocate I can hear you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so let us go please to  831 
and to paragraph 6.3.13.  Are you there? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  Yes, I am there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Deviation from clause 4.8.4: 
“Ms Tshepe and Ms Nyaka stated that the current 
settlement 
negotiations 
with 
Mr 
Gama 
were 
rationale for deviation from clause 4.8.4.  Mr 
Sharma disagreed and stated that it was not in the 
20 
best interests of the organisation to deviate.  Mr 
Sharma’s statement that he was unhappy with how 
Mr Gama’s matter was being handled.  He indicated 
that he was of the view of that the committee was 
not considering the best interests of the company 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 198 of 247 
 
but that of an individual.  The committee voted on 
whether it should deviate from clause 4.8.4, there 
were 
three 
votes 
against 
one 
in 
favour 
of 
deviation.” 
So what we know… 
“…and then it was resolved…” 
I beg your pardon. 
“…that the committee recommends that Mr Gama be 
considered for the GCE selection process.” 
So who voted in favour of deviation was you, Ms Nyaka and 
10 
Ms Tshepe and against it was Mr Sharma. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   is that right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now does this minute reflect any 
consideration of the advice that you received from counsel 
that 
to 
interview 
someone 
who 
had 
admitted 
guilt 
…[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   It does not at face value, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It does not at face value? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is it something that you considered? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Because, Advocate, on the other side – 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 199 of 247 
 
no, I do concede that at face value it does not but there 
was this subcommittee which was debating this matter. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
MR MKWANAZI:   And that subcommittee then took a 
certain view that this person can be allowed to be 
interviewed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes because of the settlement 
negotiations, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But there is just a consideration of 
10 
the settlement negotiations, there is no consideration of 
the fact that it may not be rational to interview a candidate 
who has conceded to having misconducted himself in his 
capacity as a Chief Executive Officer.  It is a great irony, 
you 
are 
actually 
settling 
with 
that 
person. 
 
Now 
consideration is given to that, is it? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I agree with you, Advocate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But, you see, Mr Mkwanazi, is this 
not really the game, I mean was the truth not of the 
position that former President Zuma still wanted Mr Gama 
20 
to be the Chief Executive of Transnet and in order to allow 
him to throw his hat into the ring, the first thing he needed 
to do was to deviate from 4.8.4 and that that is actually 
why you were settling with him, you were getting him back 
so he could go to this high office.  Is that not actually the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 200 of 247 
 
objective? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I would disagree with that simplicity. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Because you put it as if because 
President Zuma at some stage had wanted him in that top 
position but this position at that current time, there was a 
head hunter who had been appointed to deal with the 
candidates who were keen to be considered for that 
position, so he would have competed with other candidates 
in terms of suitability.  Yes, from clause 4.8.4 I understand 
10 
fully what you are saying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I just cannot understand how 
you could deviate from it in the circumstances of this 
matter. 
MR MKWANAZI:   We did deviate. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, Mr Mkwanazi, I mean you 
did indicate that you were listening to Mr Todd’s evidence 
yesterday so you know all the things that I was saying and 
at some stage I did say that part of the reason why I was 
20 
articulating some of the thoughts that were crossing my 
mind was precisely so that somebody like you who could be 
listening, who would still be coming to give evidence, could 
know what sort of issues were troubling me so that when 
you come to testify, you know, you might have thought 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 201 of 247 
 
about them and can address them.   
So it is a transparent way of looking at issues, so 
you know what is going on in my mind, you can address it 
head on if you can and if you cannot, you cannot, but I am 
not hiding from you what is going on in my mind. 
So I have difficulty with the – I have serious 
difficulty with the whole idea of the board reinstating 
somebody who had occupied such a senior position in the 
organisation and who had been found guilty of such 
serious acts of misconduct and was not challenging those 
10 
findings, you know, accepted that they were correctly made 
but with the board thinking of reinstating that person.  
But now, you are already here, as this committee, 
are doing something that contemplates that this person 
could actually be promoted.  I cannot understand the logic 
unless there is something else.   
But in terms of the facts of the case, in terms of the 
process, 
fair 
process 
to 
which 
Mr 
Gama 
had 
been 
subjected and looking at the seriousness of his contract, I 
am looking at this committee and I am saying not only is 
20 
this committee thinking of reinstating Mr Gama, actually it 
is thinking of – it seeks to give him a platform to go and 
occupy an even higher position despite the failures in his 
conduct.  How is that possible?   
How is it possible that so many people – or the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 202 of 247 
 
people in this committee and subsequently in the board 
would think that this is correct?  That is my thinking, you 
know, as I say even yesterday and on other days, I say in 
the hearing what is going on in my mind because I am 
being transparent.   
If somebody want to address it and they can 
address it and say Chairperson, I see this is how you are 
thinking but here is another angle from which you must 
look at it, then I can look at it but when it comes to this 
issue I have this serious difficulty, what can you say to me 
10 
about it?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I fully understand where you 
are coming from and yes, we did debate this clause 4.8.4 
and yes, Mr Sharma was not supportive but yes, the other 
three board members, including myself, were supportive of 
Gama being interviewed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Upon reflection, because you have had 
many years since this thing happened, upon reflection, as 
you look at it now, look back, did you think it was the right 
thing for this committee to do? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I would have followed the 
advice of Advocate [indistinct] 13.03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But why did you not follow it at the 
time?  I mean, you asked for his advice. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 203 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, we did ask for the advice and the 
time through debate and looking at various issues of 
debating that letter.  I was of the view that he must given 
that opportunity but do not forget it is now nine years later 
or ten years later and then I am asked the same question 
and I am saying hold it, I might have a different view. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps you are not in the 
same position and that you are not as compromised as you 
might otherwise have been ten years ago.  Is that not so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I understand, Advocate, I understand. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, let us then go to this 
debate and I assume you watched Mr Mapoma’s evidence 
on television because we are coming to that part of the 
transcript that he testified about.  Could you please turn to 
page 854 of bundle 1?  Eight five four. 
MR MKWANAZI:   854?  Okay, I have got that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let me ask you to drop down to 
– you see on the left hand side there is numbering? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is a 685 towards the bottom.  
20 
Can you just go up two lines from that and you see, 
Chairperson, who is yourself, you say: 
“Can you comment on that, the appeal process?” 
Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I see that. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 204 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you are asking Mr Mapoma to 
comment on that, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Then let us go over the page 
to 855 and Mr Mapoma says he is not appealing against 
the finding of guilt, he is appealing against the dismissal, 
now I said.   Do you see that? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ms Tshepe says: 
“Which is the disqualifications.  Sorry, Sachs, I just 
10 
want to understand which is the disqualification?” 
And then Mr Mapoma says: 
“Right, now advised the Chair to say if we, as 
Transnet, go to the appeal…” 
That we know is the arbitration. 
“…and oppose the appeal, we stand a very good 
chance of winning that appeal.  That was my view at 
the time.  Where I am saying we are not strong, 
Doris, is if we have to explain the rationality of why 
we are settling.  I do not think we are on very 
20 
strong grounds on that.  That is my view but on the 
disciplinary process itself and if we go and argue 
the matter on appeal we stand a very good chance 
of succeeding.  Siya can win but we can also win as 
Transnet but we have a very, very good case 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 205 of 247 
 
against him there.  That is why we said let us rather 
postpone to 24 April, Chair, after another hearing so 
that we pursue the settlement process so the 
dismissal…” 
And then Ms Tshepe jumps in. 
“Sorry, Chair, I am confused.  Then you have to 
explain to me why are we settling if we are going to 
win this case?” 
And what do you say, Mr Mkwanazi?   
MR MKWANAZI:   It looks like I said: 
10 
“We do not know.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you mean you did not know why you 
were settling? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I do not remember.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not remember saying that but yes, 
this was taped. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So you must have said so. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I must have said so, ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in the context it could only mean 
you did not know why you were settling.  Is that right?  In 
the context …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I …[intervenes] 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 206 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the question which had just 
been asked …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   I knew what we were trying to settle.  
The issue was he was – there was a contention on the 
sanction.  So we were dealing with the sanction.  So yes, I 
knew that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I am saying in the context of 
this discussion, if the recording is correct that you said we 
10 
do not know, could it …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman, I do not recall why I could 
have said that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, Mr Mkwanazi, is it not perhaps 
that you were caught off guard?  I mean, what you could 
not tell your fellow directors here is why you were settling.  
Is it not because you did not want to tell them I am doing 
this because I have been told to by the minister.  You could 
not tell them that.  So you literally were gob smacked, you 
20 
did not know what to say because here your legal man had 
said we are going to win this case and in fact he appears 
to have said well, that is why we postponed because we do 
not want that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know, Mr Myburgh, 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 207 of 247 
 
whether you want to take him step by step.  I think all of 
the points you are making are important but you have got 
all of them together. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Ja.  No, it is also late in the 
day, I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, you were caught here, 
were you not, because Mr Mapoma, the person who you 
had brought in to deal with this, had now told your fellow 
board members you are actually going to win this case.  It 
10 
put you in a bit of an awkward position, did it not, because 
of course you had already negotiated. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so you were in an awkward 
position, right? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, true. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   and you were literally gob smacked, 
you did not know what to say.  You were caught off guard, 
correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   I would agree with you, ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, absolutely.  And then what is 
insidious, I put to you, is look how you changed so quickly 
after you give it thought.  Though Tshepe says – you say 
we do not know why we are settling, Tshepe says: 
“But Sachs says we stand a very good chance of 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 208 of 247 
 
winning.” 
And all of a sudden you say: 
“No, it is fifty/fifty” 
I mean really, Mr Mkwanazi.  I mean honestly, it must be 
embarrassing to see this. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Do not forget, my saying fifty/fifty comes 
from a Deneys Reitz opinion which we had seen.  I am not 
sure of the time, ja.  I am not sure of the dates as well, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But that is really not my point, you 
went from I do not know to fifty/fifty within a sentence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means Mr Mkwanazi you were 
saying the strength of your case and the strength of Mr 
Gama’s case was more or less the same and yet Mr 
Mapoma, a senior legal person within Transnet, had just 
finished saying we have a very, very strong case and he is 
a lawyer. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, he is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then Ms Tshepe says: 
“Then I do not understand why we are settling.” 
Then you say: 
20 
“We do not know.” 
Then she says: 
“But Sachs says we stand a very good chance of 
winning.”’ 
Then you say it is fifty/fifty.  So fifty/fifty is contrary to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 209 of 247 
 
what Mr Mapoma is saying. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, Mr Mkwanazi, you had a 
different agenda here because settlement was not rational, 
it certainly was not rational in relation to your prospects of 
success, you had a different agenda, did you not? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Not really. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Now what really shows up the 
board is the next paragraph. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe before that, Mr Myburgh, 
just in the paragraph, Mr Mkwanazi, that Mr Myburgh read 
to you where Mr Mapoma is saying that Transnet has got a 
very, very good case against Mr Gama, what do you say 
about this statement by him where he says – after saying 
how strong Transnet case is, he says: 
“That is why we said let us rather postpone to the 
24 April, Chair, after another hearing so that we 
pursue the settlement process.” 
What do you say – or what is your comment about that 
20 
statement? 
MR MKWANAZI:   It sounds like a contradiction, Chairman, 
because although he does indicate that we have a good 
case, he then says let us rather postpone.  It sounds like a 
contradiction. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 210 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because when you have a good case 
you do not want to postpone, you want to finalise the case. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree with you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are ready. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree, ja.  It is a contradiction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am leaving it to you, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say the next point. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, it is a contradiction unless you 
know what was happening and the last thing you wanted to 
10 
was to go to arbitration and win because you wanted the 
man not only reinstated but you wanted to give him a shot 
at becoming the Group Chief Executive and when you see 
it that way, it is not a contradiction at all. 
MR MKWANAZI:   But that is not my statement, that is 
Siyabulela Mapoma’s… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   He is being quoted, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you see, Mr Mkwanazi, he knew 
what you were up to, he knew the game because you had 
20 
told him right at the outset you had told him. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I understand where you are coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that was his mindset, he knew 
what you were doing. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 211 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   I understand that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He knew that you told him that you 
had been instructed by someone above the ministry to 
reinstate Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore, winning the case at the 
arbitration would defeat the whole object of Mr Gama being 
reinstated as you had been instructed according to Mr 
Mapoma, therefore it had to be postponed to try and settle 
because otherwise we are going to win this case and Mr 
Gama will not come back.  What do you say? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   I understand, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand. 
MR MKWANAZI:   You logic, Chairman, makes – logical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi, you are very good at 
sidelining issues.  I mean, the point is, it is not – the 
importance is not that it is logical, the importance is that it 
is also true, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Also, funny enough, I still do not 
understand 
what 
Mr 
Mapoma 
was 
saying 
with 
this 
20 
sentence. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, let me …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   I fully do not understand. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I understand Mr Mapoma to be 
saying is that you could not go to arbitration because Mr 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 212 of 247 
 
Todd and his senior counsel was going to win that and that 
then would have thwarted the plan to get Mr Gama 
reinstated and also to allow him to have a shot at 
becoming the Group Chief Executive.  That is what he is 
saying, in effect. 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I understand what you are saying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  And now only is it logical but 
it is also true because you had been instructed to reinstate 
Mr Gama, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Reinstate is a strong word.  Yes, I had 
10 
been instructed to look into the fairness/unfairness. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Of particularly the sanction, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct.  And here your chief legal 
adviser was telling you that you have got a very, very case.  
In other words, that the sanction is fair. 
MR MKWANAZI:   It is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you had looked into it together 
with him and there is his conclusion, right?  So where to 
from here? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Come again?  I am not sure what you 
want me to say. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you to the next 
paragraph.  You have said – so Mr Mapoma says got a 
very, very good case.  Ms Tshepe says well, then I am 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 213 of 247 
 
confused, you say I do not know, then you say we have got 
a fifty/fifty chance.  Ms Nyaka chips in by saying: 
“I 
think, 
Chair, 
let 
us 
move 
from 
legal 
now.  
Because that is the problem, I think let us move it 
from legal.  He has given his opinion which, by the 
way, I do not agree with necessarily, it is his 
opinion.  I have an opinion, he shares an opinion.  
Everyone 
here 
has 
an 
opinion. 
 
Now 
the 
accountability and decision-making comes from this 
committee and let us decide at this committee what 
10 
we are deciding on this deviation.” 
Straightaway you say: 
“Colleagues, I will deviate from clause 4.8.” 
Nyaka says: 
“I will do the same.” 
Sharma says: 
“I will not.”’ 
You say: 
“We will record it.” 
And there we go, three against one.  Now this Ms Nyaka, is 
20 
she a lawyer? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I do not think so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Is that how things really 
worked, Mr Mkwanazi?  I mean, here you have a person 
saying look, we have got a very, very good case.  You get a 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 214 of 247 
 
board member saying: 
“I am really confused.” 
You say I do not what is going on.  Then it down to 
fifty/fifty and the next person says let us just leave aside 
this legal advice, let us vote in favour of deviation.  That is 
what happened here.  It is incredible what …[intervenes] 
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree with you, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you accept that upon reflection 
and reading this it truly is incredible?  I mean, this is – this 
is the work of the Corporate Governance and Nominations 
10 
Committee of Transnet. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of which you were the Chairperson. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You could only have conducted 
yourself, I want to put to you in this way, if you had 
another objective.  Is that no so? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No because still even if we had deviated 
from clause 4.8.4 there was a recruitment process where 
this individual would have competed against a lot of other 
20 
individual. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, at …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, when you try and find a 
rational explanation for something, for some decision and 
you cannot find it, you are bound to look elsewhere and 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 215 of 247 
 
say okay, there is not logical explanation for this decision, 
so why would these people have done this.  I mean there 
are a number of things that since this morning we have 
asked you and you have responded, we have discussed 
which it seems to me step by step make the Board’s 
decision to reinstate Mr Gama seem very irrational.  We 
will see by the end of your evidence whether that’s where e 
will be or whether we will be at a point where it seems 
rational, it can be understood and so on, but we go back to 
this position, I mean when we read this statement by Mr 
10 
Mapoma here at page 855 where he tells the committee 
how strong Transnet’s case is, how good the chances are 
that Transnet is going to win this arbitration, and then he 
says that is why we said let us rather postpone the matter 
to the 24 t h of April, so that we can pursue a settlement 
process.   
 
Obviously that means as far as he knows, to say the 
least, he thinks we think this case is not a good idea, 
because otherwise when you think you are going to win and 
you want to win, you are going to say I want the arbitration 
20 
tomorrow, I am ready you know, but now the way he talks it 
is like that would be bad news if we win, so that is why we 
have postponed, we want to try and settle the matter. 
 
And then you go back to me sitting here who have 
heard evidence of Ms Hogan, I have heard part of the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 216 of 247 
 
evidence of Mr Zuma, Ms Hogan said to me the Board, 
which is the Board before your Board, interviewed various 
candidates for the position of Group Chief Executive 
Officer for Transnet, it was a rigorous process, they 
recommended, they came up 
with a candidate, they 
recommended the candidate, the candidate was Mr Sipho 
Masego, and Ms Hogan put the candidate before Mr Zuma 
and said I support this candidate, the Board says this is 
the candidate, and she says Mr Zuma said my only choice 
for the position of Group Executive Officer for Transnet is 
10 
Mr Gama and she said but Mr Gama has not been 
recommended by the Board, the Board thinks he still needs 
some more experience and in any event Mr Gama is facing 
some investigation, or some allegations, there could be a 
disciplinary process, there are serious allegations against 
him, and then Ms Hogan says Mr Zuma said well in that 
process, in that case the position will have to remain 
unfilled until those processes have run their course and Ms 
Hogan wrote a memo or a letter to Mr Zuma which set out 
exactly what the process had been, but the position 
20 
remained unfilled until of course your Board came in, but 
Ms Hogan gets dropped from cabinet at the end of October. 
 
This is at a time when Mr – those processes that Mr 
Zuma had spoken to Ms Hogan about, if Ms Hogan’s 
evidence is true, had run its course, Mr Gama had been 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 217 of 247 
 
found guilty and had been dismissed, but he had referred 
this dismissal dispute to the Bargaining Council.   Ms 
Hogan gets dismissed, another Minister gets appointed, Mr 
Gigaba, and on your evidence it looks like even before he 
officially starts as Minister of Public Enterprises on the 1 s t 
of November, he meets with you, but even if you are 
mistaken that it was in October, maybe it was early 
November, it looks like one of the first things he does, the 
new Minister, on your version, is to call you and raise 
among other matters the Gama matter with you and says 
10 
Mr Gama’s dismissal was unfair and on your evidence he 
instructs you to review the Gama matter. 
 
Obviously the review could lead to Mr Gama being 
reinstated, of course it could lead to something else, other 
than reinstatement, but reinstatement is one of the things 
that it could lead to.   You agree?   
MR MKWANAZI:   I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Gigaba on your evidence initiates 
a process in terms of which your Board must relook at this 
case of Mr Gama.   You relook at that case, you look, you 
20 
ask for legal opinions, most, if not all, say this dismissal 
was fair but of course the Deneys Reitz one has got a 
paragraph which says anything can happen when it comes 
to sanction, and then I said to you earlier on the way you 
and your Board were handling the matter it appears like 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 218 of 247 
 
you were bending over backwards to accommodate Mr 
Gama, you understood when I said that, and then you are 
now in this committee, the Governance and Nominations 
Committee, what are you talking about?   You are talking 
about whether this man, who was found guilty of such 
serious 
acts 
of 
misconduct, 
by 
an 
independent 
Chairperson, who could not have been part of any factions 
within Transnet, Senior Counsel, who ran what appears to 
have been a very thorough process, and Mr Gama being 
represented by a strong legal team, including senior 
10 
counsel in that process, and he was found guilty out of that 
process.   
You are now saying in effect look even if we have 
not taken him back yet, let him run for the higher position.   
You have not even taken him back to his old position, but 
you are talking about saying let him run for a higher 
position, it does not make sense to me, unless there was 
really an agenda to bring Mr Gama back, that is what – 
those are the thoughts that are in my mind, and I mention 
them to you so that if you have anything to say to me that 
20 
could influence me differently you can say so, but that’s 
what seems to come to my mind to say the way this 
committee is acting, the way this Board is acting, it is like 
it is hell-bent to get Mr Gama back, not only to his 
previous position, but they want him at the top, they want 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 219 of 247 
 
him to run for this position. 
Now how do you seek to be party to the possibility 
of promoting to the highest executive position in the 
company somebody that has been found guilty of such 
serious acts of misconduct, how do you do that as a Board. 
 
That is what I cannot understand, if you are able to 
make me understand it tell me.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chair I cannot make you to be able to 
understand it, but your analysis is very good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You agree with the analysis, or you 
10 
understand it?    
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes fully Chair, I understand it and I 
agree with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you agree with it, okay.  Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So that is then the 3 r d of 
February.  I would like now to take you back to Bundle 2. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Two, okay it must be that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh and Mr Mkwanazi the 
witness and Mr Mkwanazi the lawyer we are at about 
20 
quarter past five, let us talk about how far we can go, I can 
still go on up to six if everybody is happy that we do that, I 
am happy to do that, and then maybe at six we can – if we 
haven’t finished we can talk about the way forward at that 
stage. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 220 of 247 
 
 
Are you happy to go up to that point? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes certainly from my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From your side, Mr Mkwanazi lawyer 
what is your situation?   You are fine with that okay alright, 
thank you.   Let us continue then, what page of what 
bundle?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bundle 2, I want to go to page 6 
please, Mr Mkwanazi.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 6? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 6, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is a draft settlement agreement, 
if you go to page 10 you will see it was actually signed by 
Mr Gama on the 10 t h of February.  There were a couple of 
...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A couple of minor amendments were 
made and it was subsequently signed, but the point is that 
it was signed before the Board meeting on the 16 t h of 
February, correct? 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh, please don’t 
forget your point that you want to ask, I just want to 
mention one thing arising from what I said to Mr Mkwanazi.    
You see Mr Mkwanazi going back to what I said last time I 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 221 of 247 
 
said Mr Zuma has denied Ms  Hogan’s version that he said 
his only choice for the position of Group CEO is Mr Gama.  
I don’t know what finding I will make in the end, but if Ms 
Hogan’s version is true then it seems that there may be 
room for somebody to say Mr Zuma would have been quite 
disappointed in the fact that Mr Gama was dismissed, and 
had been dismissed because that ruled him out of the 
running for the position of Group CEO, and it may well be 
that the new Minister had a discussion with him and he 
might have mentioned that there was this issue of Mr 
10 
Gama, and he needs to look into it.  He might not have 
said he should be reinstated, but he might have said he 
should look into it and maybe that is why he instructed you 
to review it. 
 
You understand that?   But I am not ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   I understand fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not saying that is so, but I am 
looking simply at the various versions and looking at what 
was happening and trying to make sense of what seems to 
have been happening. 
20 
 
Thank you, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes thank you. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the point I was making is that 
this agreement is signed by Mr Gama on the 10 t h of 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 222 of 247 
 
February, now you need of course some legal advice to sell 
this to the Board, it is to that legal advice that I want to 
turn now please.   Would you go to page 12, and you would 
have seen these documents, on Monday the 14 t h of 
February, so the Board meeting was on the 16 t h. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mapoma sends to Sbu Gule this 
email: 
“Sbu the Chair has asked that we prepare a two-
pager for him for the Board meeting.  I have started 
10 
the process, please look at the attachment and 
finalise/settle.” 
Do you accept that you asked for this two-pager? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And do you also Mr Mapoma’s 
evidence that that was the two pager, and you can turn to 
page 3 earlier in this bundle, that was the advice that you 
sought if you look at paragraph 4 of the consultation note 
where you had said that what you were looking for was an 
opinion setting out that there was some unfairness towards 
20 
Mr Gama. 
MR MKWANAZI:    That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You said he was trying to find here 
in this memo some unfairness. 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct Chair. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 223 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well what we do know is that Mr 
Mapoma in his two-pager does not deal with the unfairness 
of Mr Gama’s dismissal, does he? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman can you repeat, the sound was 
a little bit poor there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you have regard to Mr Mapoma’s 
two-pager .... 
MR MKWANAZI:   There is a problem with sound. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a short break while they are 
attending to the sound.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes continue Mr Myburgh, I am told the 
sound is fine now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry I beg your pardon.  Mr 
Mkwanazi what I wanted to explore with you is that in Mr 
Mapoma’s two pager nowhere does he say that Mr Gama’s 
20 
dismissal was unfair. 
MR MKWANAZI:   I do not think he says that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, alright, I would like to take you 
please to paragraph 7 of his two pager at page 13.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Page 13, okay I am there.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 224 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it says: 
“The current Transnet Board commenced its duties 
on 13 December.  The Chairman of the Board with 
the support of the shareholder Minister has within 
his rights and obligations decided to revisit the 
matter of the disciplinary proceedings against Mr 
Gama.  This decision was informed by a number of 
reasons.” 
And then ultimately those reasons lead to the solution 
being a proposed settlement and we know that the 
10 
proposed settlement was reinstatement.  Correct?        
MR MKWANAZI:   Well what page is that, Bundle 2 page 
13? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph …[intervene] 
MR MKWANAZI:   4 at the bottom there?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Okay, yes I see it.  I see it, thank you.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But the point is that the decision to 
revisit the disciplinary proceedings was done not to review 
20 
or to look at but to revisit was done with the support of the 
shareholder Ministers.  Is that right?   
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then what Mr Mapoma does is 
he lists a whole lot of things, there was a Public Protector 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 225 of 247 
 
complaint, 9, there is risk of litigation 10, a judicial 
process he says it is extremely slow, 11, there have been 
acting 
appointment, 
12, 
acting 
appointments 
good 
corporate governance relating to acting appointments.  Mr 
Gama is a highly experienced executive. And 15, we 
continue to incur legal costs.  
Nowhere does he say this dismissal is unfair, does 
he?      
MR MKWANAZI:   He does not, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that – were you surprised or are 
10 
you surprised? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No, I am not surprised yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, so now this was not the two 
pager you were looking for, correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so he passes it on someone 
then had to fill in the gaps.  So he passes this onto Deneys 
Reitz we know, alright …[intervene] 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at page 13 they were asked 
20 
to settle or finalise it and the next day Mr Sangoni says:  
“Dear all please herewith the document which Mr 
Mapoma sent us yesterday with our amendments.” 
Now the only difference between Mr Mapoma’s two pager 
and Deneys Reitz’s now two and a half pager are the 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 226 of 247 
 
additions of new paragraphs 10 and 11 which you find at 
page 17.  Would you agree with that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I agree.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is what they say at 10: 
“In the arbitration before the Bargaining Council Mr 
Gama has challenged the appropriateness of the 
sanction of dismissal.  The issue of sanction is a 
very complex and perplex matter to which there is 
no clear and straight forward answer.  This is 
demonstrated 
by 
amongst 
other 
cases 
the 
10 
celebrated case of Siduma vs Rustenburg Platinum 
Mines 
in 
which 
the 
Labour 
Courts 
and 
the 
Constitutional Courts on the one hand, Supreme 
Court of Appeals on the other came to a different 
conclusion on sanction.  The other cases dealing 
with the issue of sanction which also demonstrate 
the complexity of consideration for an appropriate 
sanction of the Shoprite/Checkers cases in which 
the facts in the two separate cases we similar but 
the Labour Appeal Court in each case came to a 
20 
different conclusion.  In one case the finding of the 
Labour Appeal Court was endorsed by the Supreme 
Court of Appeal.” 
Well that is not particularly helpful by itself, is it?     
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 227 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is just like what you might find in 
textbooks, it says well reasonable people may emotionally 
have different views of sanction in given a particular set of 
facts.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But it does not say anything in 
relation to Gama’s case.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   No it does not, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So then we are down to one single 
paragraph and it comprises of two sentences: 
10 
“It is accordingly our view.” 
Now I do not know where the accordingly comes from 
because I cannot see how it can follow from 10: 
“But it is accordingly our view that there is a 
probability that the Bargaining Council or a court 
considering the appropriateness of the sanction of 
dismissal of Gama may reach the conclusion that 
dismissal was not appropriate having regard to the 
challenge on sanction advanced by him.  In that 
instance the court may either award compensation 
20 
to Mr Gama or find that a lesser sanction ought to 
have 
been 
imposed 
and 
therefore 
order 
reinstatement.” 
There is no definitive advice there at all, is there?  They 
say well X may happen or Y may happen.  Correct?      
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 228 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   It creates doubt, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So but that is the point and you 
landed up opting for an opinion of two sentences really 
that at most creates doubt and you opted to follow that 
opinion 
instead 
of 
the 
25-page 
opinion 
of 
Mr 
Todd 
understandably.  Correct? 
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, so at most all this does is 
create doubt but it does not tell you why, it does not say 
why.    
10 
MR MKWANAZI:    That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mkwanazi it is extraordinary are 
you going to advance before this Commission that you 
legitimately and honestly settled Mr Gama’s case because 
you thought you had prospects of success at arbitration 
surely 
you 
cannot 
advance 
that 
proposition, 
on 
the 
strength of this two sentence “opinion”.  Mr Mkwanazi?      
MR MKWANAZI:   Ja, no, no I am there and also do not 
forget it continues to indicate paragraph 12, 13 etcetera in 
terms of the need to come to something.    
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but none of that has any 
bearing on prospects of success.  What you were looking 
for was an opinion that shows some unfairness so that you 
could persuade your Board members to agree to the 
reinstatement of Mr Gama at the Board meeting of the 16 t h 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 229 of 247 
 
of February you yourself said that.  This is the best 
...[intervenes]      
MR MKWANAZI:   Not true.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It does not show unfairness it shows 
some doubt.  Correct, that is all?  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, oh Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, you get this opinion being 
expressed in this paragraph.  It is – is does not say - well 
10 
when you look at it sometimes it is difficult to say what it 
does say and what it does not say but on the one hand it 
says: 
“There is a probability that the Bargaining Council 
or Court considering the appropriate method of the 
sanction of dismissal of Mr Gama may reach the 
conclusion that dismissal was not appropriate.” 
But it does not tell you why there was a probability.   
MR MKWANAZI:   It does not, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just an unsubstantiated statement 
20 
there was a probability but it does not say what is the 
basis for the view that there was a probability, it does not 
tell you that.     
MR MKWANAZI:   No it does not, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then of course it says: 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 230 of 247 
 
“There is a probability that the Bargaining Council 
or a court considering the appropriateness of the 
sanction of dismissal of Mr Gama may reach the 
conclusion that dismissal was not appropriate.” 
It does not even begin to say here are some of the things 
which if the Bargaining Council or a Court were to go that 
route that it would base its view on.  It does not even begin 
to say that.  You accept that?  
MR MKWANAZI:   I accept that Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So then one is bound to say why would 
10 
somebody of your experience, because you were quite 
experienced you had even been corporate executive of this 
entity yourself many years previously, you are experienced 
in corporate matters you are experienced in dealing with 
issues, I am sure you would have dealt with lots of 
dismissal matters at one stage or another as executive or 
group executive.   
Why would you prefer this opinion as the opinion on 
which you would base your decision to reinstate Mr Gama 
as opposed to, one, the opinion given by Mr Todd, you 
20 
would have heard when he gave evidence here, he is a 
specialist labour lawyer.  Of course I think Deneys Reitz 
also are specialists, but he gave an opinion that you read 
and you see as reflecting quite an application of mind on 
various issues.  Do you agree?      
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 231 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Agree Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you were also aware of the 
opinion from Webber Wentzel which said the process was 
fair.   
MR MKWANAZI:   I am aware of that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You were aware that the Chairperson of 
the disciplinary enquiry who came to the conclusion that Mr 
Gama’s sanction, the sanction of dismissal was a fair one, 
was a senior counsel, a labour lawyer himself.   
You were aware of all of that, so the question that 
10 
Mr Myburgh was asking is how does one explain your 
reliance 
on 
this 
questionable 
opinion 
which 
is 
not 
motivated in any way when you have this other certainly 
looking at Mr Todd’s one because it is here well I have 
read it is you know it shows somebody who has applied his 
mind to all the issues and of course he had the benefit that 
he had been handling this matter for about two years or so.  
So why would you prefer this one?       
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman as I indicated much earlier 
that one set of eyes with that was needed I tend to agree 
20 
with you that this was a weak submission and I think we 
gave Mapoma that feedback as well and which is why then 
tried to augment it but even the augmented one Chairman 
it is a weak submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But again it is like you know that there is 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 232 of 247 
 
this opinion which is correct which say this dismissal was 
fair but it is like you keep on wanting another one that will 
allow you to reinstate Mr Gama that will say something 
else.  You know you see this one it says that there is this 
probability, you see it provides no reasons for this 
probability, provides no basis but nothing says to your 
mind look let us go back to that opinion which we cannot 
fault, Mr Todd’s one, we cannot fault because as I 
understand it you have not been able to say we had a 
problem with that opinion, isn’t it?    
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could not fault it.  
MR MKWANAZI:   No I could not fault it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so one asks the question why did 
you not and the Board act on the basis of this opinion from 
Mr Todd that you could not fault? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman as I have indicated we needed 
a set of different eyes because true had we asked Mr Todd 
my interpretation is he had an opinion already and because 
we wanted a different set of eyes we then asked Deneys 
20 
Reitz and yes it is not a detailed opinion but it created 
some doubt as to when we go to the Bargaining Council 
process of whether we will win or not, ja it did that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the difficulty is that you yourself 
have indicated that this opinion was weak.   
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 233 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I agree Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was weak you have accepted that.  
MR MKWANAZI:   I have accepted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not motivated it did not provide a 
basis you know for or it did not show you this is the basis 
on which it is grounded you know and I would have thought 
that if you and the Board in seeking to get somebody else’s 
opinion other than the opinions that you already got which 
we saying the dismissal was fair.   
I would have thought that if you remained open 
10 
minded as to whether you would reinstate or you would 
settle or you would not settle I would have thought that 
when you got this opinion you realised that it was weak 
compared to this other opinion from Bowman Gilfillan and 
you saw that it was not even motivated I would have 
thought that you would say look if we act on the basis of 
this opinion we are opening ourselves to serious attack.  
The opinion that we should act on is this one that we 
cannot fault that is what I would have expected you go 
along with that that would be a reasonable thing to do.        
20 
MR MKWANAZI:   Agree Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the Board did not do this.  
MR MKWANAZI:   The Board went with its opinion, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Myburgh.  
MR MKWANAZI:   And even their augmented opinion was 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 234 of 247 
 
still weak.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but of course surely sitting here 
now looking at this you would accept would you not you 
ought have to acted in terms of the opinion given by Mr 
Todd.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman maybe not because as a new 
Board coming in you needed a different set of eyes on this 
issue particularly on the issue of sanction ja and that is all 
that the Board was looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No but I am not sure that I understand 
10 
that you see when you put it like that it gives the 
impression that you wanted a different set of eyes so to 
speak and you were going to take what they say, what 
those lawyers say take their view without evaluating it 
yourself and seeing whether it was sound.  Whereas if the 
approach was we want to hear what they have to say but 
we are not going – we will only act we will evaluate both 
options if they are not they are not the same.  We will 
evaluate both and we will act on what we believe is sound 
that is what I would have expected.  I should not have 
20 
expected that of the Board? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman I agree with your analysis we 
did not take the two opinions and put them side by side 
and debate them side by side, we debated this one.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And well I guess – and decided to go 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 235 of 247 
 
along with it even though you realised it was weak and it 
was not resonating.   
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay Mr Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja thank you alright well so now we 
know that this is weak.  I just wanted to find out from you 
what did you do with this weak opinion did it serve before 
the Board because that is not something that is clear to 
me?  
MR MKWANAZI:   If I recall it would have served in the 
10 
corporate governance committee.  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
Well 
there 
is 
no 
corporate 
governance committee before the 16 t h you prepared this for 
the meeting of the 16 t h.  Could this serve before the Board 
…[intervene] 
MR MKWANAZI:   There was a meeting on the - wait there 
is two meetings on the 16 t h, there was a meeting, a very 
short meeting it could have been a corporate governance 
just before the Board to consider this report.     
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could this opinion serve before the 
20 
Board on the 16 t h…[intervene] 
MR MKWANAZI:   On the 16 t h, that is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Remember your objective you told 
your attorneys on the 22 n d of January is that you need 
some friendly advice so that you can persuade the Board 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 236 of 247 
 
to reinstate Mr Gama at the meeting of the 16 t h of 
February.   
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you present this two and a half 
pager to the Board at the meeting of the 16 t h of February?  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman I think I did or even at the 
corporate governance meeting just before the Board.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You think you did? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, I would have to follow the audit 
trail.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But this is very important Mr 
Mkwanazi because we need to know was it on the strength 
of this opinion and I am loathed to call it that because the 
advice is two sentences and it is unreason ...[intervenes]  
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman it was on the advice of this 
opinion, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just bear with me so the Board 
decided to reinstate Mr Gama on the strength of this 
opinion.  Is that right?  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct, yes.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So was this ever then put onto - I 
have not seen it in its final form was it put onto the 
Transnet letterhead or – I mean you can tell us what did 
you do with this because Mr Mapoma said he sent it to you.     
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, it was tabled I do not recall in what 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 237 of 247 
 
form but it was tabled.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but was it tabled as a Transnet 
opinion, your opinion, was it tabled as a Deneys Reitz, in 
what form was it tabled?   
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure now I will have to ask Mr 
Mapoma myself or try and look at the audit trail of the 
documents.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Bearing in mind Mr Mapoma was not 
at the Board meeting Mr Mapoma’s evidence is that he 
gave it to you.  So what did you do with it? 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:   It was tabled.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay and you say…[intervene] 
MR MKWANAZI:   I am not sure in what form whether as a 
Deneys Reitz opinion or as an email from Mr Mapoma but it 
was tabled.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you see that makes it so much 
worse.  Are you suggesting that the committee may have 
decided this matter on the strength of his advice which was 
not even on Deneys Reitz letterhead?    
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So who was – so you present this 
opinion to the Board and I am sorry I am pressing you on 
this but whose advice did you present it as?   
MR MKWANAZI:   I would have presented it as advice 
through group legal but I was aware that it came through 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 238 of 247 
 
Deneys Reitz.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you presented it as the advice of 
group legal? 
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes, who had consulted Deneys Reitz.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It was only a few days before that Mr 
Mapoma had told some of those very directors the same 
directors that you had a very, very good case.  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean honestly Mr Mkwanazi this is 
not legitimate is it not I mean I do not know why you do not 
10 
just accept that you had another agenda.   
MR MKWANAZI:   No, no that is what was presented to the 
Board.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR MKWANAZI:   This is exactly what was presented to 
the Board, Mr Mapoma’s submission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept Mr Mkwanazi at least now 
you know we have been dealing with this from this morning 
but you were listening to Mr Todd’s evidence yesterday I 
mean the questioning you followed it and maybe you 
20 
listened to Mr Mapoma’s evidence as well.  At least as you 
sit there now do you accept that the Board’s decision and 
your decision to reinstate Mr Gama in these circumstances 
does not make sense.     
MR MKWANAZI:   Chairman we appointed Deneys Reitz to 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 239 of 247 
 
look into certain aspects of the sanction in terms of the 
Transnet Bargaining Council processes and this is the 
opinion they came up with.  I had a consultation with them 
and this is the opinion they came up with and I used that 
opinion even at Board level.  I agree with you that the 
opinion compared to the opinion of Mr Todd is weak I fully 
agree with you and which is why then we requested that 
there must be a follow-up submission based on the same 
opinion which came in something that is dated 22 n d 
February 2011 but it is basically the same opinion. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you must be talking about Deneys 
Reitz report dated 22 February 2011.     
MR MKWANAZI:   It is trying to supplement what they had 
given to Mr Mapoma.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Go to page 19 of the same bundle.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes I am on page 19.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You see that I a report, it says report for 
Transnet on settlement.    
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is on a Deneys Reitz letterhead and it 
20 
is dated 22 February and it goes up to page 22.  Is that the 
document that you say augmented these two…[intervene]     
MR MKWANAZI:   After the Board meeting, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   After the Board meeting?  
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 240 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so before the Board meeting the 
augmentation was not there.  
MR MKWANAZI:   It was not there, yes Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see now it seems to me that you 
and your Board were so hell bent on reinstating Mr Gama 
that when you had the other document that had this opinion 
saying: 
“That there is a probability that the Bargaining 
Council or a Court considering the appropriateness 
of a sanction of dismissal of Mr Gama may reach 
10 
the conclusion that dismissal was not appropriate.” 
That when you had an opinion this opinion which was in 
your view giving you some leeway to settling the matter 
and getting Mr Gama back but you realised that it was 
weak, you thought no there needs to be augmentation of 
this opinion but we will make the decision to reinstate him, 
Mr Gama, the augmentation can come back that can be 
done later.  Is that right?   
MR MKWANAZI:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then of course the augmentation 
really makes your case worse and not better now let me 
show you why.  So if you go to page 19 this is where you 
find the augmented opinion 22 February.  
MR MKWANAZI:   Yes.  
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 241 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 19 of Bundle 2.  
CHAIRPERSON:   One nine? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One nine, so the first one and a half 
pages just sets out what happened during the negotiations 
then have a look at and read into the record please 
paragraph 1.1. 
MR MKWANAZI:   Paragraph…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is now the augmented improved 
opinion.  Please read that paragraph. 
10 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct.  I must read that 
paragraph? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes please into the record. 
MR MKWANAZI:   
“There are various opinions which have been 
obtained from reputable firms of attorneys 
with regard to the prospects of success of Mr 
Gama 
in 
successfully 
challenging 
his 
dismissal by the company.  All the opinion 
including ours which we gave after perusing 
20 
documents 
pertaining 
to 
the 
disciplinary 
inquiry were of the view that Mr Gama’s 
chances 
of 
successfully 
challenging 
his 
dismissal are not good.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So here you are told. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 242 of 247 
 
MR MKWANAZI:  I have read. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. Well that is what I am saying it 
makes your case so much worse because in the augmented 
opinion now Deneys Reitz tell you about opinions from 
reputable firms all of which have come to the conclusion that 
Mr Gama’s prospects of success are not good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Effectively saying Mr Gama has no case. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that still you carried on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you settle?  How do you reinstate 
him?  How do you give him full back pay?  Of course how do 
10 
you even undertake to pay his legal costs?  It is – it is just 
something that is so difficult to understand Mr Mkwanazi.  
Except if one says there was some other agenda that the 
board was pursuing in wanting to get Mr Gama back.  It was 
not the question of was there some unfairness in his 
dismissal?  It was not just a question of are we likely to lose 
the case in the arbitration?  It was other considerations.  
Can you understand why – what I am saying? 
MR 
MKWANAZI: 
 
I 
understand 
what 
you 
are 
saying 
Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you fault it? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I cannot fault it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 243 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Mkwanazi just to finish on this.  If 
you go to page 21 you say this is an attempt to augment.   
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But under the heading of Sanction that 
is precisely the same paragraph that was in – that was – that 
paragraph there is paragraph 10. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the last paragraph was paragraph 
11.  There is no improvement. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It seems that Deneys Reitz were not 
able to improve their advice. 
MR MKWANAZI:  But there is no improvement.  I agree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you know why? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I agree there is no improvement – it is the 
same. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But it could not be improved upon 
because it seems that they were not of the mind that the 
dismissal was unfair.  In fact there is a massive contradiction 
is there not between what you find in 1.1. 
20 
MR MKWANAZI:  There is. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what you find in 4. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But despite that you pushed on. 
MR MKWANAZI:  That is correct Chairman. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 244 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson I see that it is now six 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes how much more time do we still need? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I think I still need quite a bit of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite some time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because I have yet to go to the 
essence really of Mr Todd’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that is that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  None of these three charges were the 
things that were really capable of being condoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
And 
in 
order 
to 
pursue 
that 
examination I would obviously need to analyse the findings 
of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then go and deal with that.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If Mr Mkwanazi can come back on 
20 
Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me – let me first check with – from 
yourself.  From your side are you still able to maybe add 
another hour or another thirty minutes or you have been 
standing the whole day. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 245 of 247 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR MKWANAZI:  I must think about that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is becoming increasingly difficult Mr 
Chair I must be honest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, no that is fine.  So you would 
suggest that if possibly he comes back on Monday? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright maybe we could start early? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  [Inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Mr 
Mkwanazi 
the 
attorney 
and 
Mr 
Mkwanazi the witness it seems that we should adjourn now.  
I know that – I think we are all seated except Mr Myburgh he 
is the only one who has been standing the whole day.  We 
need to think about that.  But he – he suggests that we could 
continue on Monday morning.  Would that be fine with you?  
Let us start with the lawyer. 
ADV MKWANAZI:  Obviously we have not consulted on this 
and I wonder Chair if perhaps you could give us a five 
20 
minute break just to clarify our [00:05:18]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MKWANAZI:  Just three minutes here nothing longer 
than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mkwanazi the witness you are fine – 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 246 of 247 
 
you would be fine with that? 
MR MKWANAZI:  I think I am available Chairman yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV MKHWANAZI:  Chair can I suggest that the reason I 
wanted to consult was actually [not audible].  But if he is 
available Chair we will by all means avail ourselves because 
[not audible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I do not know why there is always 
difficult in hearing you.  The line or reception is bad but you 
still require – you still – you are still asking for a five 
10 
minutes break or you say 
ADV MKWANAZI:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is fine. 
ADV MKHWANAZI:  No Chair we are confirming that we will 
avail ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are confirming okay. 
ADV MKHWANAZI:  In the interest of [inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MKHWANAZI:  The only suggestion we would want to 
add Chair is that we would require additional information 
20 
from the commission.  But could [inaudible].  We will be 
available for that thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay shall we start at 9:00 on Monday is 
that fine? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes certainly Chair. 
16 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 285 
 
Page 247 of 247 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We are going to adjourn then 
and then we will continue on Monday at nine o’clock.  We 
adjourn. 
MR MKWANAZI:  Thank you Chairman. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
