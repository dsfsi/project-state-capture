PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 28 JULY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: Good morning Mr Hulley, good morning 
everybody.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Good morning Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair we had previous had one matter 
that was set down for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That was the matter of Brigadier Xaba.  
Brigadier Xaba unfortunately has currently gone for testing 
in respect of Covid-19.  He has got counsel present today 
who 
wish 
to 
address 
you 
on 
an 
application 
for 
the 
postponement of todays’ proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The commission does not oppose – the 
evidence leaders do not oppose the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
  Good morning Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning.  You can just start off by 
placing yourself on record. 
ADV MANARA ME:  Chairperson I am Manara ME. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:    I am instructed by Maringa Attorneys. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 4 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:    And we both then appear for Brigadier 
Nyameka Xaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:    Chairperson should have had – there is 
an application that has been prepared requesting that the 
matter be postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:    In order to allow some time for him to 
get better. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I – I saw correspondence but I have 
not seen the – the substantive application.  If I could have 
that 
ADV MANARA ME:   Yes Chairperson I am just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even – I understand there is a substantive 
application? 
ADV MANARA ME:    Indeed, there is Chairperson and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MANARA ME:  And you will be addressed in that 
regard. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Chair the 
substantive application has only just been deposed.  The 
affidavit has only just been deposed to and handed to me 
and that is the copy I have handed up to you. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 5 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It has been deposed to as I understand it 
by Mr – Brigadier Xaba’s attorney because he was not able 
to go and make contact with him in order to take the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Or to administer the oath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine.  Where is this person 
who is supposed to sanitise before – let him sanitise before 
you – you go there.   
ADV MANARA ME:  Chairperson if I were to then briefly take 
10 
you through the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:  What is stated there Chairperson is that 
he is aware that he was to testify here however on Sunday 
that is Sunday the 26t h he experienced some pains which 
were later confirmed as to be symptoms related to Covid-19.  
He approached a doctor who then confirmed the symptoms to 
be as such and then directed that he should undergo testing 
and in the meanwhile isolate himself.  There is also then an 
indication of an outbreak in the offices where he works and 
20 
there has been a couple of cases confirmed in that regard.  
And it seems then that the suspicion is that he might have 
contracted it from that set of facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:  And on those basis Chairperson we 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 6 of 201 
 
request a postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:  And we had discussed the possibility of 
a matter standing down to enable the results to come out 
which we estimate to be by no later than Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:  And then after you should then be in a 
position to decide how to deal with the matter going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MANARA ME:  Thank you Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  It does sound like a 
genuine case and that there is a need for him to isolate 
himself of course.  Even the building where he works, I think 
there is a notice to close it down. 
ADV MANARA ME:  That is indeed the position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or something for the time being. 
ADV MANARA ME:  Yes it has been closed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No that is fine.  I think what we 
– I will postpone the hearing of his evidence to a date still to 
be determined and as soon as possible let the commission 
20 
know what his position is so that a date can then be 
arranged.  Or it may be that we will arrange the date anyway 
and if – I mean it will not be too close so it will allow him 
enough time to recover in case the results are positive.  And 
then if for some reason there is still a problem with the next 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 7 of 201 
 
date then we will take it from there. 
ADV MANARA ME:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The hearing of – is it Brigadier or 
Major General? 
ADV MANARA ME:  It is Brigadier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The hearing of the evidence of 
Brigadier Nyameka Xaba is postponed to a date that will be 
determined in due course in the light of his situation as 
described in his affidavit.   
ADV MANARA ME:  Thank you Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  And you are excused. 
ADV MANARA ME:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Sorry.  I saw Mr Nhleko’s hand 
being up earlier on.  Has the need fallen away? 
MR NHLEKO:  No Chair good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja good morning.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  I may as well declare Chair that I am still on 
the good side of the law.  But indeed, the need has not fallen 
away Sir.  Yes I would still like to address the Chair in 
respect of two particular matters. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I would like that opportunity Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 8 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr – let me hear Mr Hulley are you ready 
that we start with what Mr Nhleko wishes to raise or would 
you like to… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I was not aware of any… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with something. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me Mr Chair.  I was not aware 
something specific but he is at liberty to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Go ahead Mr Nhleko. 
MR NHLEKO:  No thank you very much Mr Chairman.  I do 
10 
so precisely Chair because I am here to present my evidence 
but largely with my commitment and a view that I also by all 
means need to try and assist the commission to arrive at a 
better understanding of the matters at hand and so on. 
 
Now 
the 
– 
yesterday 
– 
it 
should 
have 
been 
yesterday’s proceedings 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before we proceed. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just confirm that the oath you took 
yesterday continues to apply today. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thanks very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yesterday during the proceedings we got to a 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 9 of 201 
 
point where we – and I think at some point the Chair also 
asked very pointedly the whole question of what – where the 
reporting lines and I think it is during the time when we 
trying to figure out you know the issues of sequencing 
relating to the correspondence and the interaction between 
myself then as Minister and the former Executive Director of 
IPID Mr McBride.   
 
Now the starting point then of course I have had to 
try and think and recall some of the issues.  And I still stand 
by the view that says given the number of years in between 
10 
the role that I had played and now it is almost impossible to 
recall everything – every piece – bits and pieces of the 
happenings then.   
 
However, I have no basis for instance in regard to the 
correspondence of the 24t h and the 26t h November.  I have 
no basis to then say I do not either identify nor trust that 
those pieces of correspondence indeed all it does it 
establishes that there was an interaction on my side for an 
example requesting IPID to surrender the docket and certain 
information relating to the renditions case. 
20 
 
I think it is important to stress that that point has 
been articulated as the eagerness of the Minister to interfere 
with the independence of IPID.  And that is incorrect.  
Precisely as I had answered to the Honourable Chair when 
he posed this question.  What were the reporting lines?  The 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 10 of 201 
 
reporting lines were direct either IPID Executive Director 
reports to the Minister of Police. 
 
But also, there are provisions in the IPID Act I think it 
is Section 7(12) as you know also Section 28(1) which 
entitles the Minister to, he ask for any information pertaining 
to the work of IPID or the Executive Director and so on.  So I 
think at that point you know it is important because then it 
has got to relate to this question that the Chair wanted to be 
clarified by in terms of the – the reporting lines. 
 
And I think sequentially there was a need for that in 
10 
the light of the allegations of the two reports.  And also, what 
had been alleged as the withdrawal of the docket from the 
National Prosecuting Authority. So it became important 
because it was in the context of the ongoing work that I had 
on the one hand assigned to the Reference Group and they 
had produced a particular report at some point and of course 
there was a need also for further investigation to clarify 
ourselves about you know what happened, how it happened 
and why it happened and so on.  And then decide in terms of 
what it is that institutionally from an accountability point of 
20 
view we therefore needed to do an undertaking. 
 
So that is in respect of that issue.  I think the – the 
second one that I would also like to address the Chair about 
relates to – there are two reports.  In fact, I – I battled to 
sleep you know when I reflected on the articulations of the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 11 of 201 
 
Chair last night.  Wherein the Chair posed – poses this.  Of 
course, I think there is a question not necessarily is a 
statement and say, but what is the problem with the signing 
of the two reports?  Then I thought maybe there is a need to 
try and clarify this issue and I hope I would assist in this – in 
that regard. 
 
Now IPID by law is to investigate the conduct of the 
police.  But that investigation can also split into two ways.  It 
could be relating to investigating the police for acts of 
misconduct.  Okay.  But it could also be police in relation to 
10 
criminal crime and criminal investigation and so on.  In this 
instance we are talking about a criminal investigation 
undertaken by IPID signed off in January the 22n d of 2012 if I 
am not mistaken.  No 2014 it should be. 
 
Now – and it is not just any other report – it is not 
just any other report it is a report that was a product of 
investigating 
by 
– 
investigation 
– 
sorry 
by 
a 
chief 
investigator who then signs it off and then refers it to the 
National Prosecuting Authority for a decision to prosecute 
and that is in January. 
20 
 
Now there is no provision either by law or even 
convention for that matter that you would then have a so 
called second report which in itself does not nullify the first 
report nor the withdrawal of that report for an example. 
 
Having an equal or a similar status with the National 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 12 of 201 
 
Prosecuting Authority in other words you have the report of 
the 22 nd and the report of the 18t h March with similar more or 
less similar content and so on but at a closer look you can 
clearly see that there has been tampering with evidence 
contained therein. 
 
Now - so it is not a report that corrects the cosmetics 
and grammar and language and so on.  The second report.  
It is not a report that does that.  All it did it blacked out 
material 
evidence 
with 
the 
view 
to 
influence 
the 
recommendations that they had.  And I think that is where 
10 
the fundamental problem is. 
 
Now I am raising this thing precisely because I think 
we 
should 
appreciate 
that 
you 
have 
a 
legislative 
arrangement on the one hand between IPID and the National 
Prosecuting Authority in terms of the referral of such reports.  
On the other hand, there is administrative responsibility and 
that 
administrative 
responsibility 
lies 
with 
the 
Chief 
Investigator to sign off that report and recommend it to the 
NPA. The small thing that I am probably – forgetting to 
mention is that insofar as the criminal investigations it is 
20 
usual practice that the National Prosecuting Authority would 
assign a prosecutor and or prosecutors to assist IPID in an 
investigation.   
 
Okay but at some point, they have got to step off 
from that particular exercise.  In this instance it was 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 13 of 201 
 
Advocate Mosing an Advocate Moletse I think of the NPA 
who were assigned to this particular investigation to assist 
IPID in the production of the investigative report of January 
22n d. 
 
Now the anomaly is this then.  Is that when you – 
when we engaged with the National Prosecuting Authority 
particularly these respective Advocates, they did not know 
anything about the second report.   
 
Now if indeed the second report was a valid one as it 
has been claimed for an example then these – the National 
10 
Prosecuting 
Authority 
and 
particularly 
Mr 
Mosing 
and 
Moletse would have been in the know of the production of 
that report.  Okay.  So – and that is where the disjuncture in 
a sense lies in.  So – and that it – it should be understood in 
that context because I think the misunderstanding is that 
when we talk about the second report visa vie the first report 
it is you know I think there is a – there is a view that wants 
to say, no those were just grammatical sort or changes and 
so on it is not true.  But the fact of the matter is that and I 
will show it here that you distinctively in the body of the two 
20 
reports have deletions – you know have deletions. 
 
So if – if anyone of us institutions of state on matters 
such as this we will want to perpetuate that kind of narrative 
then I think we must accept that the South African society is 
not secured. Because if you are going to have agencies of 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 14 of 201 
 
state that can willy nilly interfere with the investigative 
reports and processes and so on and alter and tamper there 
with a view to change recommendations at the end of such 
reports then you are not – that is not going to be a public 
benefit 
insofar 
as 
matters 
of 
finance, 
justice 
and 
humaneness for an example. 
 
So that is largely the problem.  So I thought let me 
just clarify with this particular matter because I think there 
has been a lot of misunderstanding around it and I think it 
would be of benefit to the proceedings of the commission 
10 
that we begin to also delve into the issue of the two reports.  
Because even in the public mind the question is, what are 
these two reports that we keep on speaking about and what 
is the difference between the two of them?  And how come 
when we came across a situation such as that?  I sincerely 
do thank the Honourable Chair to grant me this opportunity 
to try and clarify these particular matters. 
 
Thank you – thank you very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Indeed that is a very 
important part of what the commission wants to look at in 
20 
relation to what Mr Khuba or Mr McBride and Mr Khuba may 
have said in relation to your involvement in regard to the 
reports.  I think that Mr Hulley is moving towards that issue 
so I will allow him to do that.  I think that we must deal with 
that issue quite properly because is if you – if you did watch 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 15 of 201 
 
when Mr McBride and Mr Khuba gave evidence you would 
have seen that I have certain things that I did not understand 
which I would like to be dealt with with regard to every 
witness including you who comes here who was involved.  
Give that witness an opportunity to enlighten me and make 
me understand whatever I might not understand because 
when you are not involved in the situation you might not see 
things in the same way as somebody who is involved.  But it 
is important for me to articulate what my areas of concern 
are when I have areas of concern.  Because that gives the 
10 
witness – that gives you the opportunity to address those 
concerns head on so that if after you have addressed them, I 
still do not understand it should not be because you did not 
get a chance to address them.  It should simply be because 
you did your best and for whatever reason maybe I still do 
not understand.  So it is important.  But I just want to 
mention that with regard to one of the issues you have 
raised I connected with a question I asked yesterday where I 
also referred to the Independence of the – of the IPID.  The 
idea was simply to say to the extent that there is some 
20 
independence on the part of IPID one needs to understand 
the extent of that independence vis-a-vie the Minister.  So 
that is why I was saying what are the reporting lines so that 
one can see to what extent – how the relationship is 
supposed to work?  So – but as I say I think Mr Hulley is 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 16 of 201 
 
moving towards a point where we can engage with that area 
of the – of the reports quite in-depth then we can deal with 
it. But if there is something you think should not wait until 
that point you can deal with it now. 
MR NHLEKO:  No thank you very much.  You know I really 
do beg your indulgence also in this regard.  I forgot one 
small thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  But you also you know are mentioning a 
critical part around the issue of independence and I think we 
10 
will get to a point also to take into account the reflections as 
well as the subsequent sort of order by the Constitutional 
Court in regard to the issue of independence.  Because I 
think it is a crucial point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Now the – the one thing I forgot to deal with 
when dealing with this thing and apologies for forgetfulness 
is that we should be alive all of us to the fact that people 
died and died through allegedly agencies of state that were 
supposed to uphold the law.  And if – I think if we fail 
20 
whether it is institutions or state and South Africans in 
general to be alive to that fact then that would mean we are 
losing our humanity in a sense.  And I think we should when 
we deal with the question of the two reports we should know 
that between the question of the – of the two – of the so 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 17 of 201 
 
called two reports they are human lives – people that really 
died regardless of whether they were guilty of any other 
whatever and so – but they died in the hands of state 
agencies and so forth. 
 
Now 
I 
am 
raising 
this 
point 
Honourable 
Chair 
because I have heard a disturbing articulation and in fact 
this articulation I also even picked up – picked it up not only 
in Mr McBride’s affidavit but also even in the correspondence 
of the commission when they wanted me to forward reports 
that were produced by – by the Reference Group there is a 
10 
reference to something called the so called Rendition Case.   
 
Now I have a problem with that articulation because 
rendition took place it is not so called.  There was an 
investigation.  The NPA was involved and so on at some 
point so it is established, it is a fact – it is factual it took 
place.  There are statements too in that regard sworn to by 
different individuals who also played a role in such an 
exercise and so on.  So it is not so called it is factual. 
 
But if we were to continue with the view that says it 
is so called so we must also accept that we shall develop a 
20 
concept called so called deaths because there were people 
that died.  So we will then say you know this so called 
deaths and so forth and I do not think we can get to that 
point.  For me it bothers me from a conscious point of view 
that we cannot begin to develop concepts and notions of that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 18 of 201 
 
nature particularly when we are dealing with human lives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And that is a point that I forgot to also include 
in the question of the two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I will – I do not want us to – to spend 
more time – a lot of time on it.  I hear what you say but I 
remember – I remember that some people say when 
somebody has been arrested by the police and it is said that 
the person is a suspect and they saw that he or she killed 
somebody they say they do not understand why he is called 
10 
a suspect because we know he killed so and so.  He killed so 
and so why is he called a suspect.  So – but I do not want us 
to spend time on it.  Let us move on.  I understand where 
you come from and ja okay alright.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  But without going 
into too much in relation to the so called Rendition Case 
there was a docket opened in that matter which was 
ultimately handed over to IPID you aware of that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Which was ultimately handed over to NPA. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  To IPID.  There was a docket in respect 
20 
of the Rendition Matter. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That docket was ultimately handed over 
to IPID for further investigation and IPID then ran with that 
docket 
in 
other 
words 
continued 
to 
investigate 
the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 19 of 201 
 
allegations that had been made in respect of the Rendition 
Matter. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm.  Chair I am aware of an investigation 
undertaken by IPID and subsequently that investigation 
referred to the National Prosecuting Authority. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So the case that that relates to.  That the 
case has a case number and it is got investigators in that.  
That case is the official case number that is assigned to it 
but in addition, the reference to the so-called Rendition Case 
Mr Nhleko is to the fact that the media had referred to it as 
10 
the Rendition Matter or the Rendition Case. 
MR NHLEKO:  I hear you.  I do not seem to get you Mr 
Hulley.  Are you saying we called it so-called because the 
media referred to it as Rendition? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The official type or the official... the 
official reference to it is the reference to the case number in 
respect of that being opened.  That is the official.   
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So other... everything else is to the so-
called Rendition Matter because everybody understands 
20 
what that is referring to there.  Do you understand that? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I do not. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  Well, ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  ...[indistinct]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...let us move on. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 20 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now you have referred to two issues that 
you would like to raise.  The first issue was in respect of 
Section 7(12) of the IPID Act.   
MR MOKHARI SC:  No, Chairman just to correct the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes, if you check-in so that the witness 
is not... so that an incorrect proposition is not put to the 
witness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  The matter has been referred to official 
as Rendition Matter and we can take it from the report.  So I 
am looking at official documents.  The first report is the 
report of 25 June 2012 of the... the then secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to make sure that we do not 
spend time on whether it should Rendition Matter or so-
called Rendition Matter, but I accept Mr Mokhari, if the 
document or report or docket referred to as the Rendition 
Matter, no impression should be created that the document 
20 
or report said so-called if it did not say so-called. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes, indeed.  I was just correcting that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just correcting that.  Yes. 
MR 
MOKHARI 
SC: 
 
...that 
the 
official 
documents 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 21 of 201 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  ...referred to it as Rendition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. [laughs] 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes, yes.  And I have a report of 
25 June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  ...of the Civilian Secretariat and the 
report of the Reference Group of 22 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I simple say for present purposes, I 
10 
do not have any problem with somebody who refers to it as 
the so-called Rendition Matter because they might not be 
sure whether it falls within... what happened falls within what 
is referred to as Rendition or they might not even know what 
Rendition means.  So I do not have a problem with that.  
Anyone who calls it a Rendition Matter, that is fine as well. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us move on. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now Mr Nhleko, you referred to Section 
7(12) of the IPID Act to make the point, as I understand it, 
20 
that there is in fact a report in the line between the... 
between IPID or the Executive Director of IPID and the 
minister’s office.  Do I understand that correctly? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, you do. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So let us consider Section 7(12).  Section 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 22 of 201 
 
7(12) says... and Mr Chair it should be in the legislation 
bundle.  We have marked it Exhibit Y Legislation and 
Authorities Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will the witness... I think the witness 
should have the benefit ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  He should have a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...of being given the same thing.  They will 
then give it ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  No, it is fine.  I will listen.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You know?  You will follow? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  I will follow, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Continue... just read it Mr 
Hulley.  You will ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  It says the 
following: 
“The executive director must at any time when 
requested to do so by the minister or parliament 
report on the activities of the directed(?) to the 
minister or parliament...” 
 
Is that the provision that you are relying upon? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is what the... I pointed(?) out. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now of course, he is required under this 
section to report to you on the activities that have been 
conducted.  It might be even an activity related to a specific 
matter as in the... in respect of the Rendition Matter. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 23 of 201 
 
 
Now, it certainly does not... unless you... unless you tell 
me otherwise, Section 7(12) does not require you or require 
the executive director to hand over a docket to the minister 
or to parliament.  Would that be fair to say? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I think that is a matter of your 
interpretation versus my interpretation really.  We may 
decide Chair whether we want to spend the whole day trying 
to unpack the conceptual understanding if... what that 
section is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It depends on the point that Mr Hulley 
10 
wishes to explore.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The minister as an executive function 
relative to the SAPS, relative to IPID.  Would that be fair to 
say? 
MR NHLEKO:  The Minister of Police in that ministerial 
portfolio a ...[indistinct] has got institutions that report 
directly within that particular portfolio to the executive 
authority there, who then is termed as the Minister of Police. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So I am not sure if I entirely follow.  You 
are saying that the minister has different portfolios reporting 
to the minister? 
MR NHLEKO:  The Minister of Police is for, amongst other 
things, made up of the South African Police Service, DPCI, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 24 of 201 
 
IPID, the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, as 
well as, the Civilian Secretariat for Police which is basically 
housed within the administrative section of the ministry and 
so on.  So that is my understanding of that institutional 
arrangement.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, no, no.  That is fair enough.  But the 
point is that it is an executive function.  The ministry is a 
political appointing, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And the operational matters get done or 
10 
the operational head of the SAPS ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...would be the National Commission of 
Police. 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That be fair to say? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, that is fair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Then insofar as dockets are concerned, 
when a docket... as far as a docket is concerned, when an 
investigation needs to be conducted or if a docket needs to 
20 
be given to any person at operational level, that docket must 
go to the... or can go to the National Commissioner. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, not insofar as IPID is concerned and I 
think we need to understand the mandate of IPID visa vie the 
police service.  You would not emphasise a situation where 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 25 of 201 
 
then the police are handed reports that are about them.  It 
would not make sense from the side of IPID because IPID 
investigates the conduct of the police in respect of criminal 
matters and other areas of previous conduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would investigate... they could 
investigate even the National Commissioner? 
MR NHLEKO:  They would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  They would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  They... that is what the law establishes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He falls within the jurisdiction in terms 
of the investigation as well. 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly, exactly.  Correct.  Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well, let us just go through the provisions 
of Section 7 and it actually would be useful ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just to complete the point 
which I think you seek to make.  The point you seek to make 
is, IPID has jurisdiction to investigate conduct by all people 
20 
who are police officers under SAPS or maybe it goes beyond 
that but ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  No, it does goes beyond that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  It is all police officers in the South African 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 26 of 201 
 
Police Service and municipal police services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no-no.  No, no.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know about the municipal. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because you did not... you did not... 
you are not responsible for them, I am not talking about 
them. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was talking in terms of SAPS that you say 
10 
it is only police officers.  Clerks and other people would not 
fall within that... within their jurisdiction.  Is it not?  
Administrative staff who are not police officers. 
MR NHLEKO:  They are admin staff that are defined outside 
of the South African Police Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  In other words, they are part of the Public 
Service Act by definition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  But you could also find that when admin staff 
20 
that 
are 
classified 
under 
the 
South 
African 
Police 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...who... 
if 
you 
are 
police 
officer 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 27 of 201 
 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...but performing...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Admin ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: ...admin stuff, you would still fall under 
them. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, you would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but if you are not a police officer, then 
you would not fall under them even though you are within 
SAPS. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the point you are making is that the 
IPID had jurisdiction to investigate even the National 
Commissioner. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that there is a reason why the 
executive director reports to the minister. 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reason is, if they were to report to 
the National Commissioner, there would be a serious risk 
that the National Commissioner would be the subject of 
investigation of people quite senior close to him. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 28 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is not an ideal situation and that 
is why the law says they must report to the minister. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, I think that is a correct understanding.  
Otherwise, their work will be severally polluted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because... yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the minister is not... does not fall 
under their jurisdiction.  He ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  H’n-‘n. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is not a police officer. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
MR NHLEKO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair.  Mr Nhleko, thank 
you very much for that because in fact you are in part right 
as far as that is concerned.  I would like you to consider 
Section 7(4) of the IPID Act.   
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  Okay.  No, go ahead sir ...[indistinct]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you look at ...  there is a file 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  I make my attempt to listen. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you go to file Divider 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he is quite happy that you go ahead 
and put the question. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 29 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will be able to understand. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he has to look at the act, he will feel 
free to do so. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Section 7(4) says the following: 
“The executive director must refer criminal offences, 
revealed as a result of an investigation, to the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority 
for 
criminal 
prosecution and notify the minister...” 
10 
 
Have you got the provision sir? 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja-no, I am listening.  I hear you very well. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   
“...and notify the minister of such referral...” 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what the minister must be informed of 
is the fact that IPID has conducted an investigation.  IPID 
has come to the conclusion that the investigation has 
revealed the commission of an offence and IPID must then 
refer the matter the National Prosecution Authority for 
20 
prosecution and must merely advise or notify the minister of 
such referral. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, Mr Hulley.  I am still try to find 
where the ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is page 152 of the bundle.  It is file 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 30 of 201 
 
Divider 8.  It is part of the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  One, five, two? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  The one, five, two of that bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Legislation and Authorities? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct, Mr Chair.   
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are referring to section...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is Section 7(4). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what you as the minister have to be 
informed of is the fact that IPID has made a referral to the 
National Prosecution Authority or prosecution of a case that 
it has investigated and that it believes or that IPID has come 
to the conclusion that the case should be prosecuted. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Not provide you with a docket but if 
you... that... would it be... would it be fair to say that Section 
7(4) does not suggest in any way that a docket has to be 
20 
provided to you? 
MR NHLEKO:  No.  The... generally speaking, in the 
application of institutional instruments, there are ideal 
situations, but in this instance Mr Hulley, you might be 
missing one particular point. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 31 of 201 
 
 
The one particular point is this.  You already had 
allegations of misconduct levelled against the very same 
IPID.  So, in other words, ...[indistinct] IPID was “somewhat 
tainted” because of the issue of tampering, right. 
 
And that matter that is brought to your attention as the 
executive 
authority, 
to 
then 
say 
but 
there 
are 
these 
allegations of serious misconduct which deals with the 
question of tampering and/or deletion of material evidence 
from one report to constitute another report.  What are you 
doing about that? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
MR NHLEKO:  But...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Let us just...  Sorry. 
MR NHLEKO:  So I am saying.  Yes, indeed.  In fact, this 
provision was applicable and it applied.  You know, you 
would always get reports about, you know, as minister about, 
this is the amount of work that we are doing.  This is about 
the case and so on and so on.  So you will get such reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR NHLEKO:  But there was a specific... a point... a specific 
20 
problem and that is the question of the two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am really concerned... and I appreciate 
that explanation and we will get to that in a moment.  I am 
very concerned with the question of Section 7(4).  It grants 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 32 of 201 
 
a... it places an obligation upon IPID to provide the minister 
with the docket. 
MR NHLEKO:  It makes a provision for submission of 
information. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  To notify you of the fact of the referral. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am talking about 7(12). 
ADV HULLEY SC:  [Indistinct]  
MR NHLEKO:  Information that the minister will require. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, what I am trying to suggest is.  I 
have to take it step-by-step.  And I certainly will not be 
unfair to you where I will try to compel you to answer a 
question in isolation but I just want to go through it step-by-
step.   
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And once we are finished with the 
section, I will give you an opportunity to tell me, where you 
find the provision that allows you or impose an obligation 
upon IPID to provide the minister with the docket.  Would 
20 
that... is that a fair way in which to deal with it? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am listening sir.  Yes, go ahead. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am saying I am listening. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.   
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 33 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Go ahead. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you will be satisfied that Section 7(4) 
is not that provision that I am... that imposes an obligation 
upon IPID to provide the minister with a docket? 
MR NHLEKO:  It is a matter of interpretation, sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  So let us go to section 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe let us put it this way.  It is your 
understanding of it Mr Nhleko, that it includes a docket as 
part of what the executive director must or may send to the 
10 
minister?   
 
Is that how you understand it?  Is it how you understood 
it at the time?  Or you do not have a specific understanding 
of it but you are not sure whether you would agree with the 
interpretation that Mr Hulley puts forward? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, Chairperson as I have eluded earlier to 
this point, earlier on.  You had a specific problem and a very 
prudent problem.   
 
You, therefore, require all the necessary information to 
enable you to as an executive authority to delve into the 
20 
identified issues and deal with the allegations. 
 
Now, I am just making an example.  If you, for an 
example, you needed to evaluate and establish whether 
there are two reports and is it the 22 nd versus the 
18t h of March and so forth, you... the issue of the docket 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 34 of 201 
 
would also enable you to be able to look into that, okay. 
 
And how... and what are the issues that constitute the 
issue at hand, you know.  Because that is what the issue of 
the ...[indistinct].  That is how it would be useful to yourself 
as a person who is trying to look into what the facts are in 
relation to that. 
 
But if you choose to be narrowly administrative, you talk 
of the docket as the docket and the file that moves from one 
place to another and that is it. 
 
But if it is in relation to establishing the facts and the 
10 
happenings about the whole question of what happened in 
this particular matter, you will definitely need to look into the 
content and statements and everything else that constitutes 
that particular document.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you see.  I understand what you are 
saying but I think the problem is that Mr Hulley is not there 
yet. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is at a prior stage of simple seeking to 
establish what your own understanding is of Section 7(4).  Of 
20 
course, you might have an understanding of Section 7(4) and 
you might say, “This is my understanding of Section 7(4).  
This is how I understood it.  Whether my understanding is 
right or wrong but this is how I understood it at the time.  I 
am not a lawyer.  I was a minister.  This is how I understood 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 35 of 201 
 
it”. 
 
And then Mr Hulley can say what he wants to say.  If he 
says, “No, it is wrong.  It is not...  You are not a lawyer”.  
Okay.  But you may have had an understanding of it.   
 
But it is also possible that you did not necessarily have 
an understanding of it.  In which case, all you say is:  “Look, 
I am not sure if I had an understanding of it.  Or I am not 
sure that I applied my mind to what it means or I knew what 
it meant.  But if you ask me for why I asked for certain 
information, I can explain to you why I asked for that 
10 
information”. 
 
So 
at 
this 
stage, 
he 
is 
just 
seeks 
to 
establish 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...whether 
you 
do 
have 
a 
certain 
understanding of what it means.  And then, once he knows 
that, he can move forward and then maybe go to the stage 
that you have dealt with already. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  No, thanks very much Chair.  But I 
really do believe that I have responded to that question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Of course, it may not be the legalistic kind of 
...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, no.  That ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  You know.  Because, I think as you just say, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 36 of 201 
 
you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:  [Indistinct] a friend of the... 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
The... 
you 
obviously 
had 
an 
understanding of Section 7(12) and what sections... what 
powers Section 7(12) ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  ...invested in you or what obligations 
based on IPID.  The question I would like to peruse is, 
10 
whether that was the understanding you had at the time i.e. 
in 2014?  Or is this an understanding that you... that has 
come to you subsequent to 2014? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I also do think I have responded to that 
question Chair.  I have cited the... that relevant provision, as 
well as, Section 28 of the same act.  The one thing that I 
may not necessarily had at my disposal is also the IPID 
Regulations because they also do talk to that matter. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You know, I think my question was a 
relatively simple one.  If you are unable to recall, you are 
20 
welcome to say that.  If you if you did not... if you had a 
specific understanding at that point in time but of course, 
then you would say that.   
 
If you had an understanding that it only became 
apparent to you later on, as you have gotten involved more 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 37 of 201 
 
and more court cases around these issues then, of course, 
you are welcome to say that as well.   
 
The only question I am asking you is, was that your 
understanding in 2014 when you were having interaction with 
IPID on the matter of the Rendition docket? 
MR NHLEKO:  I have responded to that question sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must respond again Mr Nhleko so we 
can make progress 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I responded to that question Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what was your response? 
MR NHLEKO:  That the issue of asking for information on 
the side of IPID is and was informed by the relevant section 
in the IPID Act and I cited section ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Nhleko.  There was a time 
yesterday where I could hear you very clearly.  I do not know 
whether you were coming closer to the mic or not. 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see the aircon is also making some 
noise.  Ja, if you come closer to the mic, I think I can hear 
20 
you clearly.  Will you just start ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Apologies Chair and ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not your fault. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just start... just answer again.  What was 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 38 of 201 
 
your response? 
MR NHLEKO:  And may I also be congratulated by its Chair 
for looking at him most of the time, this time around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the record will reflect that you are 
looking at the Chair today ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...unlike yesterday.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes ...[indistinct] [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yesterday you were looking away from the 
Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, now I know.  And I had difficulty to 
swing(?) around the seating and so on.  Thanks, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  
MR NHLEKO:  No, I was saying.  Look, I responded to this 
question Chair.  That this very same act was in existence at 
the time and Section 7(12) and 28(1) of the IPID Act, as well 
as, regulation... I think it must be Regulation 15, deals with 
the issue of information from the side of IPID as requested 
20 
by the minister as an executive authority.  So I think that 
clarifies that particular ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Effectively, if your response that 
those sections to which you have referred in the IPID Act 
and the regulation that you have referred to ...[intervenes]  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 39 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Regulation 15, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...entitles the minister to request certain 
information from the ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  The executive ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...executive director? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that information, you say, would 
include a docket or you are not going that far? 
MR NHLEKO:  I could not get your last part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I am saying, are you saying that those 
10 
sections of the IPID Act to which you have just referred and 
the regulation, entitled you as Minister of Police to request 
that information from the Executive Director of IPID and the 
information you could request could include in a specific 
case a docket? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, it would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I can enquiry from you the view that 
20 
you held, and we understand you held that view at that point 
in time i.e. in 2014, was that a view that you had come to on 
your own or had you sought legal guidance before arriving at 
that conclusion?  In other words, did you seek an opinion 
from any advocate, attorney or a lawyer? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 40 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  So, how is this relevant Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, I did not hear that? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I am saying, how is this question 
relevant, whether I got an opinion from ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  ...a particular lawyer or somebody and so on?  
How is it relevant? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be relevant in the sense that if you 
relied on legal advice you might not be criticised for it. 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  So those who advised you, may 
be criticised, you know.  But if you it is your own 
understanding, then you can be asked to explain your 
understanding. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  No, I... it is a nice explanation and 
interpretation of... of that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am just wondering whether, at the level of 
political management, those things are ever applicable.  
[laughs] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you see ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, but ...[intervenes] ‘ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually, the question might help you Mr 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 41 of 201 
 
Nhleko.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question might help you because 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, yes.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  Well, let me now say because 
of what.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokhari is laughing. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am afraid I am going to ask you to 
answer the question. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja.  No, no.  I will answer the question.  It is 
just that it sounds like the Chair is trying to save me some 
future troubles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:   But nevertheless, Chair, in the ministry of 
which I was, you know, the head, we had – firstly, you had 
a legal function attached to it, we also had the – I know 
that I had legal advisers and so on, I think also the Deputy 
20 
Minister and so on.  So, you know, you would certainly rely 
on advice when it comes to matters such as this.  In other 
words, legal matters, broadly speaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Buy the question would be in regard to 
this undertaking, was your understanding based on advice? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 42 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is the answer, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So you had actually taken the trouble 
to seek legal counsel on whether you had the power to do 
that which you ultimately did do, i.e. to call for the docket 
from IPID? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the opinion said that you could do 
exactly what you ultimately did do? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I did, sir. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  And was that internal or 
external counsel that you sought the opinion from, there is 
that internal? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, it is an internal function. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay.  Now you then called for the 
docket and we are talking now about in the year 2014.  You 
called for the docket from IPID, correct?  Referred you to 
the letter of 24 November 2014.  I did so yesterday, do you 
recall that? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the docket was provided to you. 
MR NHLEKO:   I think it was. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is the – it has been the evidence 
that the docket that had been provided to you, it was the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 43 of 201 
 
evidence certainly of Mr McBride that the docket that was 
provided to you contained the 22 January report but 
unsigned and the 18 March report signed and I am talking 
now 
about 
the 
report 
of 
IPID 
into 
the 
rendition 
investigation. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, that is incorrect, the signed report is 
the report of the 19 t h – no, it is the report of the 22 n d which 
was then referred and filed with the National Prosecuting 
Authority long before Mr McBride assumed the role as 
Executive Director of IPID.   
10 
 
Now I accept that also the so-called report was also 
signed and countersigned by two other individuals as well 
which, in itself, also maybe at some point talk about it but 
the report of the 22 n d was already with the NPA for a 
decision to prosecute or not to prosecute. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry, I am not sure if I am following 
you, I am making a specific proposition.  The proposition 
that I am making to you is this but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am also not sure if I follow the 
point you are making, Mr Nhleko.  As I understand the 
20 
question from Mr Hulley, sought to confirm that what the 
Executive Director of IPID said to you included the two 
reports.  One - but the one of 22 January was unsigned, 
the copy he sent to you but the one for 18 March was 
signed. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 44 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he sought to establish just that, 
whether you have a recollection that what the executive 
director gave you included those two reports but the one 
for 22 January being unsigned.  Is that something you 
remember, is that something you are not sure about?  
MR NHLEKO:   No, I have always had a signed copy 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you have never had an unsigned 
copy. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   The 22 January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And the copy that you had, is it 
one that came to you from the Executive Director, it is not 
one that came from the NPA or anything like that.  In other 
words, your source was it only the Executive Director? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, that was not the source.  It was not the 
source. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   Remember that I made my own enquiries. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chair, on this particular issue and it is 
a matter that was there before I came in as Minister, and 
so on, so it was a matter that was also part of the 
institution then because I am not sure, for an example, at 
the time when the issue of the report of the 22 n d was 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 45 of 201 
 
spoken about is the report that is being altered and so on. 
I had no idea about the work that was done before 
by the Civilian Secretariat, for an example, which led to 
IPID 
conducting 
that 
investigation 
which 
then 
was 
concluded on the 22 January.  So I am saying it is – you 
know, through my own enquiries, that is a report that I 
found. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there is a report that you found when 
you came or that you got through your own enquiries. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that report of 22 January was 
signed, was a signed report. 
MR NHLEKO:   Is a signed report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But do you have a recollection 
whether the Executive Director did provide you with the two 
reports or it is something you cannot remember? 
MR NHLEKO:   It was only one report and that was the 
report of the 18 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the 18 March? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, of March. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not give you…[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   No, not the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the 22 January one. 
MR NHLEKO:   Not the 22 January one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 46 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So the 22 January report signed was 
given to you by – from other sources but the 18 March 
report was given to you by the Executive Director of IPID.  
Do I understand that correctly?  Okay, let us take it one 
step at a time.   
22 January report, the signed 22 January report 
was given to you by some source other than the Executive 
Director of IPID. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Is that right? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And can we be specific as to who gave 
you the signed 22 January report? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I instructed members of staff in the 
ministry to establish the issue of this report, whether we 
had it in the ministry and so on.  Now the ministry, Chair, is 
made up of various individuals and functions in there, 
okay?  So if you instruct people in the office, they will go 
different whatever ways to try and establish whether is that 
the kind of a thing that can be obtainable within the 
20 
ministry and so it goes.  So that is how it came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, does that mean you 
cannot remember who exactly gave you that report? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I cannot, I mean, there is no way that 
I would.  I mean, you give an instruction for people to try 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 47 of 201 
 
and find this report.  At some point you come back, it is on 
your desk, you know?  It is that kind of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And we are speaking here now 
because we know that the Executive Director of IPID 
provided you with the docket and with the signed 18 March 
report on the 26 November of 2014.  So what I am asking, 
what I would like to know, is when he provided you with 
that docket and the signed 26 – sorry, the signed 18 March 
report, did you already have the first report which was the 
10 
22 January report that had been signed? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I did.  I did. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you – when he gave you, that is 
the Executive Director of IPID, gave you – furnished you 
with the 18 March report, was that the first time you laid 
your hands on the 18 March report or did you have it from 
other sources already, the 18 March one? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, it is possible, it is possible.  But, 
remember, Chair, that the allegation, as it were, said there 
20 
was this report which makes different recommendations 
from the report of the 22 n d and so on and that needed – of 
course, needed to do some work around it.  So it is very 
probable that, you know, that was the first time I saw it 
because I sat with the two reports then having got to look 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 48 of 201 
 
at what were the said differences as alleged, for an 
example.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying it is very probable 
that by the time the Executive Director of IPID gave you 
the 18 March report you already had one or are saying it is 
very probable that it was the first time that you were laying 
your hands on the 18 March report when he gave you 
…[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, I am saying it is probable that it was 
the first time I laid …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your hands on it. 
MR NHLEKO:   My hands on …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 18 March report. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, the 18 March report.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. 
MR NHLEKO:   Chair, could I – I think there is a famous 
thing these days that is called a comfort break. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is the right time. 
MR NHLEKO:   It is a code word for trying to do something 
else. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is the right time, we normally take 
a break at quarter past eleven and it is quarter past 
eleven.  We will take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at half past eleven. 
MR NHLEKO:   Thank you, Chair. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  Your mic, Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Nhleko... 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a light next to you, in the event 
it is dark and you want to read something, I hope it is 
working, it is there specifically for the witness should you 
need it because I have seen in the past that sometimes it 
10 
can be quite dark and sometimes the witness cannot see 
when they want to read.  So I just want to mention that it is 
available to you. 
MR NHLEKO:   Thank you very much, Chair, but it is not 
working.  As and when it works I will do what Moses said in 
Genesis of the Bible.  I will inform the Chair accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe during lunch break they will 
have a look and see why it is not working.  Okay, thank 
you. Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  So if I 
20 
understand correctly, Mr Nhleko, on the 26 November of 
2014 you would at that stage have had two reports, both 
signed.  The first report dated 22 January 2014, the second 
report dated 18 March 2014.  One supplied to you by your 
source that you are not sure of at the moment but within 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 50 of 201 
 
your structures within the SAPS.  The second supplied to 
you by IPID directly by Mr McBride.  Do I understand that 
correctly? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I think we – that is what we spoke to. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now on the 6 December of 2014 you 
gave Mr Dramat a notice of intention to suspend him and 
you ultimately …[intervenes] 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Can we correct the date, Chair, it is 
the 9 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Yes.  It is actually recorded in the 
judgment of Helen Suzman Foundation v The Minister of 
Police.  We will hand it up and then it is very helpful.. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you, Mr Mokhari 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Mokhari.  Thank you, Mr 
Chair.  At any rate you ultimately suspended him on the 23 
December of 2014, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   I am not sure of the date but it was in 
December, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now let us just go back because 
20 
according to Mr Khuba, his testimony was – and he filed an 
affidavit to this effect, that on the 6 December of 2014 he 
was 
approached 
by 
General 
Berning 
Ntlemeza 
who 
informed him that he should watch the news because there 
was going to be a hit on Dramat. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 51 of 201 
 
 
Now if I understand your testimony correct, you are 
disputing the fact that you would have communicated that 
information to Mr Ntlemeza, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   I just wander as to why would I do that, 
Chair.  I supervised General Dramat directly and that is 
precisely it.  So as to where this thing comes from about 
General Ntlemeza who then engages with Khuba and they 
talk about whatever they talk about, I just thought no, I will 
come into that really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, Mr Khuba gave evidence 
10 
to the effect that he was told by General Ntlemeza exactly 
what Mr Hulley says, as I recall and that something then 
came up in  - is it on television, Mr Hulley, or not yet? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sorry?  He later found out that in fact 
– it was on television. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That Mr Dramat – sorry, General 
Dramat, had been – in fact been suspended.  That was the 
23 December and that he has been placed with General 
Berning Ntlemeza.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think the question arises from the 
fact that if the Minister of Police was the one vested with 
the power to suspend General Dramat… 
MR NHLEKO:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …certainly the Minister of Police is the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 52 of 201 
 
one who knows once he has made a decision that he is 
going to suspend General Dramat.  Now if somebody else 
tells Mr Khuba that something is going to happen to 
General Dramat – I do not know whether I said we must 
watch on television or whatever – and something does 
happen and what happens is the suspension of Mr Dramat.  
It seems to me that it is legitimate for one to say but in all 
probability there are very few people who may have known 
that the Minister is going to make this decision or had 
made this decision until it was announced. 
10 
 
So if it not the Minister who told this person, who 
could it be?  So I think that is the angle and I think Mr 
Hulley is seeking to get confirmation from you that your 
position is that you did not tell General Ntlemeza.  Or, if 
there was a reason for you to tell him, yes, you did tell him 
and this was the reason.  That is what he seeks to 
establish. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, look, Chair, I absolutely have no 
reason to speak to another employee about the fate of 
20 
another employee, really I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you did not share that 
information with Ntlemeza. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I did not.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 53 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now can exclude the possibility that 
General Ntlemeza had simply guessed this because he was 
already 
communicating 
that 
to 
Mr 
Khuba 
on 
the 
6 
December and as it so happened, on the 23 December 
when General Dramat was removed, who was he replaced 
with? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   When General Dramat was removed, 
who was his replacement, acting replacement? 
MR NHLEKO:   It was General Ntlemeza, sir. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  So the possibility of this 
being a pure coincidence seems highly unlikely that other 
than on the explanation that General Ntlemeza must have 
known that this was going to happen, would that be fair to 
say? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, it is not fair to say.  In fact, I think it is 
unfair speculation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So at the time on the 6 December this 
apparently – and I thought I had understood that the notice 
calling upon General Dramat to give reasons why he should 
20 
not be suspended, I understood that that happened on the 
6 t h but apparently I am wrong about that and in fact it only 
happened on the 9 t h.  But when you invited General 
Ntlemeza – sorry, General Dramat, to give reasons why he 
should not be suspended was it your intention to ignore 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 54 of 201 
 
those reasons if he in fact made representations or 
provided you with reasons? 
MR NHLEKO:   Chair, I respect due processes and I am 
very particular about them to an extent that those who care 
to tell you will tell you that I have always in my 
professional function and duties wherever I have been 
assigned to, avoided to have preconceived ideas about 
what needs to happen to a person who allegedly has 
committed a wrongdoing and so on. 
 
So when they say to you, as an employee, these are 
10 
the allegations – in fact generally in the public service we 
call it a contemplation letter – that these things have been 
brought to my attention and because they have been 
brought to my attention, give me the reasons why I should 
not pursue this particular matter or matters particularly in 
relation to whatever the specific issues would be, okay? 
 
So I do not – in fact I am even much better than 
lawyers, I think, it is a – you would know this, Chair, 
because of your background as well in labour matters, that 
it is a common thing for lawyers to approach you and say 
20 
yes, you are the employer and you want us to assist you in 
this particular matter but what do you want?   
And I always tell them look, all I want is the fair 
processing of the specific sort of matter, so do not ask me 
about whether my intentions are to get rid of this person or 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 55 of 201 
 
any other thing about this particular individual because the 
issue is what wrongdoing has been committed and what is 
it 
that 
needs 
to 
be 
done 
to 
rectify 
that 
particular 
wrongdoing.  That is it.  And fair processes are critical, 
extremely critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I guess the short answer is you 
would not have had any intention to ignore representations 
if representations were made by General Dramat. 
MR NHLEKO:   Exactly, exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And do you recall whether General 
Dramat did in fact make representations to you? 
MR NHLEKO:   I think he must have because I think I 
eventually then wrote back to him in relation to an 
interaction that must have taken place.  Of course, you 
would appreciate that I am no longer in government and 
therefore the question of pieces of correspondence and so 
on and documentation will be problematic but I think he 
must have. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now on the 23 December you in fact 
20 
suspended General Dramat, you replaced him with General 
Ntlemeza but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Probably – I am sorry, Mr Hulley, 
probably 
in 
the 
judgment 
Helen 
Suzman 
Foundation, 
probably that is covered. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 56 of 201 
 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Actually, the judgment set out the 
entire history in terms of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   So maybe I can even make the copy 
available and maybe… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   It should be in the bundle. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   No, I mean, of Helen Suzman 
Foundation.  Oh, it is in the bundle.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I expected it to …[intervenes] 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   But we made copies, anyway. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is one at page 273 for Helen 
Suzman Foundation, by Prinsloo J. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Yes, that is the correct one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   So that judgment, it will, I mean 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has got the …[intervenes] 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Prinsloo J reproduced even the 
contents of the notice and all those thing, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, yes.  Thank you, Mr Mokhari. 
20 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  I will look into it 
a bit later, Mr Chair.  So, Mr Nhleko, obviously you would 
have had a discussion with Mr – or with General Ntlemeza 
before the date on which you suspended General Dramat, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 57 of 201 
 
correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   I would have had discussions with him? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   About what? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   About him taking over the acting role. 
MR NHLEKO:   But how would I talk to General Ntlemeza 
about taking over the acting role in a position where 
General Dramat is occupying?  How do I do that?  I would 
make a case even if it is yourself, how would you do it?  
Somebody is occupying a position and you are talking to 
10 
somebody about occupying that position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us – I think let us hear the short 
answer, Mr Nhleko, and I think the short answer might be 
yes, I did speak to him or no, I did not speak to him and I 
think from what you are saying you mean you did not speak 
to him, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   It is correct but I am trying to establish the 
logical sense here, that you have somebody occupying a 
position and then it alleged or expected that you would 
speak to somebody else about occupying that position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but, you know, so …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   It defeats the whole of your procedural 
fairness as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may but we will make better progress 
if you are able to just say I did or I did not, but for what it 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 58 of 201 
 
is worth, if I can say this, subject to the question of the 
timeframes, 
I 
can 
imagine 
that 
somebody 
who 
contemplates suspending a certain person from his or her 
job, particularly a crucial job, may prior to actually making 
the decision to suspend that person start thinking about 
who will I put in if I do actually suspend this person and 
may 
begin 
to 
talk 
to 
possible 
candidates 
without 
necessarily him saying you will be replacing because no 
decision has been made but wanting to make sure that they 
do not suspend somebody who may be in a crucial position 
10 
and only after that start thinking who will replace them, so 
– but I am just saying I can imagine that kind of situation 
but I think your answer is you did not speak to him and in 
your view there would have been no justification to speak 
to him at that time because Mr Dramat was still in the 
position. 
MR NHLEKO:   But could I come into exactly just this 
example you just made, Honourable Chair?  When you 
contemplate, it is exactly that, you are contemplating, you 
would not have taken a decision to actually put this 
20 
particular employee on suspension.   
So what – the whole question of what ultimately 
happens hinges on the required submissions from the side 
of the employee about whatever the issues are so that that 
could also assist you to be able to weigh whether the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 59 of 201 
 
reasons 
are 
weighty 
enough 
and 
not 
so 
enough 
to 
therefore not put that person on suspension, okay?  So 
there is no question of you therefore need to go to 
somebody else before, you know, before you are actually 
activated suspension and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Now – but also the second part of your 
example, and this is where I want to come in, the question 
of talking comes very late.  Remember, these are your 
employees and all their personal records are with you.   
10 
So we are able to assess strengths, weaknesses 
and whatever it is that you are looking at based on what 
you have before you, okay?  And then it is then that you 
would then decide that in fact employee x that can also fill 
the shoes in the meantime and so on, okay?  
Now the – I think the advantage with an institution 
such as the police, it is an order-based institution.  So I do 
not want to go any further but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Basically, what you mean, you know 
which employees you have, you can order them to say 
20 
come tomorrow, you report there. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, I am making this distinction, Chair, 
because you would appreciate that in the ordinary sort of 
industrial life there could be a degree of variances 
opposed to an order-based kind of institution and so on, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 60 of 201 
 
you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   I mean, at least my experience tells me 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well.  So then would it be fair to 
say, given your answer, would it be fair to say that prior to 
making 
the 
appointment 
of 
General 
– 
the 
acting 
appointment of General Ntlemeza you did not consult with 
him and you did not consult with anybody else that was 
10 
part of the senior management at the SAPS? 
MR NHLEKO:   I would not be sure about the entire sort of 
processes and so on but, you know, I know that – put it 
this way, in my – the first time I saw him basically, General 
Ntlemeza, that is, was when I was doing provincial visits.  I 
think he was the Deputy Provincial Commissioner in 
Limpopo, okay?  That was the first time I came across him 
and it was, of course, you know, part of the ministerial 
programme as alluded to earlier on, for instance, in terms 
of when I came in and needed to understand the workings 
20 
of the portfolio and so on and basically that was it at that 
time. 
 
So I – the question or who else I must have spoken 
to, for an example during the whatever period, it is 
possible that I spoke to a number of individuals within the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 61 of 201 
 
police service themselves about maybe few individuals that 
I also wanted to consider, that is now at the point of the 
submissions having been received from General Dramat 
and it became clear that there was further work that 
needed to be done and therefore it was necessary to put 
him on suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you say that that discussion that 
you say may have happened would have happened at a 
time when in your own mind you had made up your mind 
that you were going to suspend him, that is General 
10 
Dramat, because you had studied his representations. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, when it became apparently clear as it 
would turn out, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NHLEKO:   But I am certain that given the fact that he 
was 
also 
Provincial 
Commissioner, 
Deputy 
Provincial 
Commissioner at that time, now the reporting lines are very 
clear there.  It is the National Commissioner responsible 
for so and so, I would have had an engagement with the 
National Commissioner to then say… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have shared the information 
that you were going to suspend General Dramat with the 
National Commissioner at that stage and if yes, who else 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 62 of 201 
 
do you think you would have shared that information before 
General Dramat was told? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, again, the sequence of events I may 
not necessarily be quite sharp on at this stage. 
 be quite sharp on at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   But institutional arrangement would have 
dictated that, you know, you speak with the National 
Administrator of the Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, National Commissioner. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   The National Commissioner, yes.  And, you 
know, in relation to – now what I would not know, I cannot 
recall whether I really spoke to her at the time of the 
contemplation or post-contemplation but – because we had 
regular 
sort 
of 
interactions 
and 
engagements 
and 
structured kind of meetings, it is very possible that I spoke 
to her about what had transpired and been brought to my 
attention and therefore, it necessitated that something 
needed to be done about the issues as identified at the 
time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from the National Commissioner 
would there have been somebody else within the SAPS 
with whom you would have shared the information that 
either you had decided to suspend General Dramat or you 
were looking at that possibility? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 63 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I would not have done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not have done that? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I would not have done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   As again it goes back to the point that I 
said you cannot engage with another employee about the 
fate of another one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   It is completely wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   In fact, it then constitutes your whole 
procedurally fairness kind of respect and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   So it is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not have happened. 
MR NHLEKO:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Now 
apart 
from 
the 
National 
Commissioner would you have shared that information with 
anybody else within the executive of cabinet, government, 
prior to informing General Dramat or not?   
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Not at an executive level, if I am 
understanding you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am talking about cabinet. 
MR NHLEKO:   You are talking about cabinet? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 64 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Then I would go to cabinet and say 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, either cabinet as in the body of 
some individual or individuals in the cabinet including the 
President. 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh, okay, okay.  So I think in a nutshell you 
want to know whether did I advise the head of state about 
the – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Either the head of state or any other 
colleague within the cabinet. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   No, it would not have been any other 
colleague, it would have been the head of state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The head of state? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes and briefing him about these issues as 
they came up and so because it would not be fair, for 
instance, to a President to hear from the media about (a) 
the contemplation letter being dispatched to a high police 
official or even for that matter, eventually, suspension and 
so on.   So it becomes important to then brief the head of 
state about this is what I have established and this is what 
20 
the law says and therefore this is what I am required to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would be fair to say the only people 
that you shared the information with in terms of the 
decision which you had either made but maybe not 
necessarily communicated yet to General Dramat or that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 65 of 201 
 
you 
were 
contemplating 
making 
with 
the 
National 
Commissioner and the head of state?  Would it be fair that 
is the position? 
MR NHLEKO:   I just could not get the first part of – would 
it be fair to say what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or would it would be fair to say you are 
saying 
the 
only 
people 
with 
whom 
you 
shared 
the 
information, either that you had already made the decision 
to suspend General Dramat even though might not have 
communicated to him at that stage or that you were 
10 
contemplating making a decision to suspend him, that the 
only people you shared this information with were the head 
of state and the National Commissioner? Would it be fair to 
say those were the people? 
MR NHLEKO:   I think that would be a fair assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Now, of course, 
having communicated that information to the National 
Commissioner and having communicated that information 
through to the head of state, one of the first questions that 
20 
either one of those two would have asked you was, who are 
you going to replace the – who are you going to put into 
the acting position as the head of the DPCI?  Would that 
be fair to say? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I am not sure whether they did that.  I 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 66 of 201 
 
really cannot recall whether anybody asked me that 
question but with regards to the National Commissioner 
indeed I think I did share views with her about, you know – 
and she also made some suggestions of either individuals 
that we could consider.  Now that is at a point when, you 
know, I have eventually had to make a decision about 
suspension, okay?  Ja, it …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that with regard to the 
National Commissioner you did tell her who you were 
thinking of as a temporary replacement for General Dramat 
10 
during the suspension and in your discussion the National 
Commissioner mentioned other possible names you could 
think of.  Is that what you are saying? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  But you are saying that the 
head of state did not ask you about who would replace 
General Dramat during the suspension? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I do not recall him asking me as to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:   …okay, so who are you going to place there 
for the replacement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Hulley? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  So presumably 
when you approached the National Commissioner you 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 67 of 201 
 
already had in mind one or more people.  She proposed 
additional people and the two of your sat and discussed 
which was the best person to put into that position.  Would 
that be fair? 
MR NHLEKO:   Maybe I think it happened that way, yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now you would obviously have come 
with a few suggestions yourself or was it only one 
suggestion? 
MR NHLEKO:   It could have been a few, I think.  Could 
have been a few, yes.  Probably two or three of those. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And you say that as the Ministry was 
the employer, I think you said, of the members, you have 
got access to their personnel files.  Do I understand that 
correctly? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, I could have access to personnel files 
through the National Commissioner, of course. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   So I am saying I could have access to 
personnel files and profiles of individuals through the 
National Commissioner. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I see.  So what you are saying is that if 
you wished to have, to access a particular personnel file, 
you 
would 
– 
you 
could 
do 
it 
through 
the 
National 
Commissioner but you do not have direct access to it 
within your office or within your ministry? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 68 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I do not.  I do not. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So you would have obviously have 
called for these personnel files in respect of the people 
that you had in mind, beforehand, in other words, before 
meeting with the National Commissioner? 
MR NHLEKO:   I’m not sure whether – I think in the 
meeting situation yes, because you’d have, I think, at 
initial stages you’d have an open meeting about – or 
discussion, sorry about a few individuals, names okay but 
a National Commissioner is an administrator who will then 
10 
go back and look at the actual profiles and the skills, sort 
of levels and sets of people then take it on from there. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now, moving forward into January of 
2015 
because 
these 
events 
happened 
on 
the 
23 r d…[intervenes]. 
MR NHLEKO:   Come again you said in 2000 and what? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Into January of 2015 things that we’ve 
been speaking about thus far all took place in December of 
2014, in other words the suspension of General Dramat 
and the acting appointment of General Ntlemeza, those 
20 
took place in 2014.  Now, in 2015 we know that you, from 
your testimony that you gave here – we know that you 
never approached Mr Robert McBride to discuss with him, 
the fact that he had provided you with a report of which he 
was one of the signatories, that being the 18 t h March 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 69 of 201 
 
report and you had these two reports but you never 
discussed, with Mr Robert McBride why the second – how 
the second report came about, that was your testimony 
yesterday if I understood correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on a second, you were dealing 
with reports earlier and then I thought you moved to the 
issue of the suspension of General Dramat and that’s why 
we were talking about what Mr Khuba said, he was told by 
Mr Ntlemeza, you now refer to the reports, is that because 
you’re moving back to the reports or is it still under the 
10 
issue of the suspension? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I’m moving – I may come back to the 
suspension 
but 
I’m 
moving 
now, 
chronologically 
into 
January. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
well 
you 
might 
be 
moving 
chronologically in terms of the dates and events but I was 
thinking you were following themes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to come back to the 
suspension or are you done – to the suspension of General 
20 
Dramat or are you done with it?   
ADV HULLEY SC:   We may come back to it at a later 
stage depending on how we deal with certain other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, proceed. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thanks, now – so you’ve got these 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 70 of 201 
 
reports which you already had as far back as November – 
26 t h of November 2014, you – we move not into January of 
2015.  What do you decide, you haven’t consulted Robert 
McBride who was the head of IPID, in fact you haven’t 
consulted IPID at all about the existence of the two 
reports?  You start considering the possibility of an 
investigation and appointing a private firm to investigate 
the issue, is that correct, we’re in January of 2015? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I think you may be incorrect in 
respect of two things.  The first one you say – I think 
10 
earlier on you alluded to yesterday and I think, even this 
morning, you alluded to pieces of correspondence and 
exchange between myself and Mr Robert McBride.  Now – 
and of course – now I’m dealing precisely with that 
question because in your formulation you are then saying I 
did not speak to him or consult with him or something like 
that. Now, so what do you define, how do you define these 
pieces of correspondence between him and myself, that’s 
one.  The second thing is that you are faced with a 
situation here where allegations of the existence of the two 
20 
reports are made and senior individuals in the institution 
are implicated in the alteration of the report of the 22 n d to 
produce the report of the 18 t h of March.  Now – and I think 
we need to be alive to this thing that we are then talking 
about an institution whose image then, is somewhat tainted 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 71 of 201 
 
but also the issues of integrity become a vocal point here, 
in a sense.  So – and linking that, this issue that we have 
spoken to, linking that to an earlier decision that I had 
taken, Chair, to process exactly those issues, how come 
we have, on that situation – now the situation is in twofold, 
do you have a report that recommends criminal prosecution 
for an example but do you have another allegation and/or 
report which, in a sense says, that report that you are 
referring to, has been altered and that also could be 
divided 
into 
two 
when 
you 
talk 
about 
an 
employee 
10 
misconduct around that because then you have your 
employee who is alleged to have tampered with evidence 
and so on or a report.  So, you therefore, need to look into 
the institutional arrangements insofar as processing that 
particular matter is concerned.  But also, by further 
extension is that you also have possible, sort of, criminally 
issues arising out of that employee misconduct you know 
and so it goes.  So, I thought let me just respond in this 
particular way to try and clarify this particular point that Mr 
Hulley has been pushing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t know what your plan is, Mr Hulley, 
you may have a certain plan but I want us to get into the 
meat of this issue of the reports.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s get to the meat of that report 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 72 of 201 
 
because I’ve been waiting that we get to it, let’s get there, 
let’s deal with it and then move on to something else. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Now, the two 
reports…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let me just say this, and for me 
the meat of that issue encompasses, among other things, 
the question of what was the nature of the alterations, 
alleged 
alterations, 
were 
they 
alterations, 
can 
they 
properly be called alterations?  Was IPID entitled to 
provide the report of the 18 t h of March, were they entitled 
10 
to provide such a report, if so, under what circumstances?  
Were they entitled to say, well, there is something we are 
not happy with, with the earlier report, here is our latest 
report, this is the one we want you to look at, you know? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were there – was there a proper basis 
for the Minister to seek an investigation of this issue by 
Werksmans and then of Course – and Mr July will come 
later this week, the question of the recommendations that 
Werksmans gave to the Minister whether there was a 
20 
proper basis for it was there a proper basis for those 
recommendations, could it be that there was some other 
agenda because I think one or more of the IPID witnesses 
may have suggested that there was something more than 
just genuine investigation of issues and that the idea was 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 73 of 201 
 
to get rid of some of them.  So, I think, let’s get to that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Now, when you 
decided, 
Mr 
Nhleko 
to 
hand 
the 
matter 
over 
for 
investigation to an external firm of attorneys, at that point 
in time you had the two reports, one dated 22 January 
2014, one dated 18 March 2014.  At that point in time you 
believed that there were alterations that had been done to 
the one report in – the alterations from the first report 
which rise to a final product which was the 18 March 
report, is that – do I understand that correctly? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   The starting point is at two levels, Chair.  
The starting point is why do you have two reports, so which 
is which between the two, that’s your starting point.  The 
second area of that starting point is why these two reports 
have got two sets of recommendations that are completely 
the 
opposite, 
sort 
of 
okay. 
 
So, 
you 
have 
the 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Conflicting recommendation.  
MR NHLEKO:  Conflicting recommendations yes and it’s 
from the one institute, one and the same institution and the 
20 
common denominator is a Chief Investigator who also 
appears in the first report but also appears in this other 
report with a different set of recommendations and the 
question is why okay, so you’ll start there first.  Now, I 
think I’d spoken to, what I think I referred to as, allegedly 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 74 of 201 
 
sort of, employee misconduct, sort of.  Let me put it in 
simpler terms, maybe suspicions of, either an employee 
has, you know.  Now – so you do need to get to the bottom 
of that issue but because, essentially the matter here – 
and I think that’s – it’s just there have been a number of 
misconceptions and misinterpretations of about this thing 
at many different levels but this issue of the two reports 
and the involvement of Mr McBride, Mr Khuba, Mr Sesoko 
and so on, it’s about employer, employee relations, that’s 
what it is and the employer, in this instance, the Minister of 
10 
Police there had a duty to then try and ascertain what 
exactly transpired in this particular instance okay. 
 
So even if you were to go outside and look for 
assistance you will need a specific, sort of – my English is 
running out, where there’s a dedicated sort of assistance.  
In other words, you’ll be looking for a particular and 
specific competency, if I may put it that way. So, for 
instance if you have a lawyer called Zondo somewhere 
okay and he’s a labour specialist and so forth, you are 
likely to go that route as opposed to a Mr Hulley who’s a 
20 
criminal lawyer, I’m just making an example.  So, you 
would have, in a sense, to also define, sort of, some 
scoping of sorts in terms of what kind of competency are 
you looking at to assist you in matters such as this and so 
forth.  So – and remember, honourable Chair, we had said, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 75 of 201 
 
when we started on this issue because I think the issue of 
– let me try and – I suspect you nearly said something 
about my mic, Chair, so that’s why I’m drawing it closer.  
Now, I think when we started – you know the issue of 
Werksmans should not be seen only in the context of 
Werksmans as a stand-alone out there.  You have to 
understand the process, processes as a reference group, 
producing a particular set of reports and then from there, 
you then evaluate, yes you have these reports but what 
else do you need in order to take an informed decision 
10 
about this particular matters.  So – and that exercise was 
entirely located within the civilian Secretariat of Police to 
then say look, there’s these issues and these matters 
institutionally look at how these matters are to be dealt 
with so that we have – we needed to have some absolute 
clarity about what was the actual state of things around 
this particular issue of the renditions. 
 
So, it should then be understood in that context that 
even the issue of Werksmans itself cannot be separated 
from the initial work that started off with the appointment of 
20 
the reference group and it then developed further in terms 
of, we wanted to have much more clarity on it.  We then 
said, honourable Chair, that we needed to know who and 
under what circumstances was the original report of the 
22 n d of January altered and how the second report came 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 76 of 201 
 
about, so that’s the starting point.  So, where did this thing 
come from and so on, now – and I think I’ve alluded to this 
thing, you also have, you know, the Chief Investigator 
appears in both reports.  The second area is whether, by 
so doing, in other words, alterations does it constitute 
misconduct or any offence and if so by whom.  Now, you’d 
also understand this, honourable Chair, even from a – the 
Labour Law, let me not say Labour Law but from sort of 
relations practice really, an employee – one of the 
considerations when you deal with disciplinary matters, 
10 
that employee should be, one fundamental question should 
be whether he or she was in the know or is in the know of 
an 
existing 
policy 
for 
an 
example 
pertaining 
to 
a 
transgression or alleged transgression and so forth and 
that’s why this issue became important.  The question of 
whether any misconduct or offence would have been 
conducted by somebody and if so, who’s that particular 
person. 
 
The third area is whether there’s prime facie 
evidence of misconduct and criminal liability by Lieutenant 
20 
General Dramat for an example, Major General Sibiya and 
any other officers mentioned in the original report.  Now, 
again, is the question of the original report which made 
specific recommendations with regards to these specific 
individuals.  The fourth area, the circumstances under 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 77 of 201 
 
which the report and the docket handed in the National 
Prosecuting Authority and what happened to the docket 
once – which was in the possession of the NPA.  Now, the 
prosecutors in the form of, I think, Advocate Mosing and 
Moeletsi made statements in regard to how the issue of the 
docket was handled by them at the NPA and the reference 
is to a series of internal communication within the National 
Prosecuting Authority in trying to clarify this issue of the 
report of the 22 n d and allegedly the second report which is 
the 18 t h – the report of the 18 t h of March, the last area. 
10 
 
We also needed to establish whether any other 
matter that would come to the attention of people assigned 
to the investigation would be relevant to conclusions and 
findings. Sometimes when you have a scope for an 
investigation you start somewhere but somewhere down the 
line you begin to discover other things that were not known 
at the time when scoping was being done and so on and so 
on.  I think this point really talks to that issue and that’s 
how the issue of the appointment of Werksmans comes in.  
So, I agree with you, honourable Chair, that between 
20 
yesterday and today there’s a lot of other things that we 
said and spoke about but we’ve really been skating on the 
periphery here.  The issue, both before this Commission 
and the South African public is, is it true that there were 
two reports, if so what’s the difference between these two 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 78 of 201 
 
reports and thirdly what is it that was done about it and 
what it is that is to be done about that because it’s a 
matter that remains hanging and outstanding, honourable 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would imagine that if somebody who 
reports to me gave me a report on a certain subject or 
made a report available to me on a certain subject, call it a 
first report if you want to and then later gave me another 
report on the same subject I would imagine that the first 
question that would arise with me is, does this second 
10 
report replace the first report, in other words, can I throw 
the first one away, is this your report to me, the latest and 
if he says, yes, the latest is my report to you, throw away 
that other one then then I would throw it away and look at 
this one but if I have read the first one, I may say, let me 
not throw it away as yet let me read the second one and 
then take it from there and if there’s a need for any 
clarification they would arise from there.  Why didn’t you 
regard the second report, and when I say second report, I 
refer to the one of the 18 t h of March, as the report that the 
20 
IPID intended to be their report and no longer the first one, 
why did you not regard the second report as the report 
they intended as their final report to you or actual report to 
you because otherwise why would it be necessary to have 
two reports?  So, wasn’t the second one meant to replace 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 79 of 201 
 
the first one? 
MR NHLEKO:   Chair, I will answer that question, perhaps 
in two ways.  Maybe let’s start with the last area, with the 
why – the last question from the Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last part of the question ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, why I couldn’t consider it as – the 
second report as the final and whatever. Now, the question 
is, what happens to the first one or what happened to it 
because this very same one – and by the way convention 
has it, Chair, that anywhere in the world, if you produce a 
10 
report at some point and you feel  there are things that I 
would have to do whatever about and so on, maybe change 
or alter and so it goes, the first point of reference is to 
also state that we are nullifying the first one, that’s the 
first point.  Now in this particular instance the legislative 
and institutional arrangement between IPID and the NPA 
says, if IPID is investigating – conducting a criminal 
investigation the NPA would assist them with prosecutors 
or a prosecutor okay.  Now – so in other words, if you’re 
then producing another report you must still pull in those 
20 
particular prosecutors and say, there’s something wrong 
with this report and whatever it is that you consider to be 
wrong or need updating or whatever the case is so that 
they, themselves, would also be part of a consulted sort of 
arrangement and so on.  Now, that did not happen so we 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 80 of 201 
 
keep – up until today we keep on referring to two reports 
precisely because within the possession of the National 
Prosecuting Authority, they have the report of the 22 n d and 
then another report that then emerged later and so it goes.  
So, that’s my response to the second part of your question 
and I think the first part of your question, Chair, I think I’ve 
alluded 
to 
this 
particular 
point 
you’ve 
already 
had 
allegations against this institution, now you therefore also 
needed to, as an employer, you also needed to embark on 
a particular exercise to establish the veracity of these 
10 
particular allegations and precisely because you are not in 
as competent as you could be in terms of, you know, just 
the 
finer 
details 
around 
a 
particular 
issues 
of 
investigation…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please don’t forget exactly the point you 
want to make but I just want to make sure I follow it.  
Which allegations are you talking about? 
MR NHLEKO:   The allegations of the two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   And the different sets of recommendations, 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, continue. 
MR NHLEKO:   So, you already have that right, those are 
serious allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well – but remember that my question, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 81 of 201 
 
and I hope I don’t confuse you about the first part of the 
question and the second part of the question but my 
concern is the second report deals with the same subject 
matter as the first report.  Why are you not taking the 
second report as the report intended by IPID to be their 
report and not the first one because it’s the same subject 
to the extent that there is some conflict between the two, 
they can’t be intending both of them to be their reports at 
the time of submitting the second one? 
MR NHLEKO:   Could I suggest, Chair, that we come back 
10 
to 
this 
question 
but 
maybe 
the 
starting 
point 
really…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: That’s fine.   
MR NHLEKO:   Should be an evaluated exercise of what 
are these two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And then we begin – we will then need to 
come back exactly to the questions that the Chair is 
raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, Mr Hulley just make a note of 
20 
the question please. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   I have no difficulty with the – with 
going into the reports but the question is, firstly, before we 
even get into a consideration of the report, we need to 
understand why it was considered necessary to refer the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 82 of 201 
 
matter to Werksmans in the first place. Now we know from 
the – we know from the evidence that’s been given by Mr 
Nhleko that there were allegations. We understand now, 
that the allegations relate to the existence of the two 
reports.  Now if I understood Mr Nhleko’s testimony before, 
these are not allegations, it was a fact, he had the two 
reports. He had the signed report of the 22 n d of January he 
had the signed report of the 18 t h of March, he had both 
reports before him.  Now, against that backdrop, if I might 
Mr Chair, you’ve got the two reports, it’s not an allegation, 
10 
you’ve got the two reports and you’ve got the second 
report, the signed report of the 18 t h of March you got that 
on the 26 t h of November of 2014, correct?  That was your 
earlier testimony sir. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I’m waiting to hear the question.  Now 
against that backdrop are you suggesting that there are 
allegations that there is something untoward about those 
two reports because you’ve got the reports in front of you, 
you can look at them yourself? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I’ve responded to the question 
20 
extensively, Chair I even outlined the – what areas needed 
to be considered in dealing with this particular question.  So 
in all fairness Chair I think let us deal with the reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is – you see as we go along, we 
might not all have the same recollection of what you said an 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 83 of 201 
 
hour earlier and yesterday.  An evidence leader when he 
has a certain question may sometimes want to make sure 
that his premise is correct and therefore might ask you to 
confirm that this is what you said before.  So from your side 
you might say, oh why is he asking me again. Now of course 
I do not want him to ask you the same question all the time 
because we need to make progress but sometimes an 
evidence leader does that just to make sure that his next 
question is not based on a misunderstanding of what you 
said earlier on.  So I just thought I might clarify that. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  No I accept that Chair.  I accept that very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  And in fact, I would also venture to say that 
some of these questions are still valuable [00:01:29] would 
have delved into the report.  My misgiving that I suspect 
that between yesterday and today there has been a concert 
effort not to deal with this.  Now and I am not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you… 
MR NHLEKO:  I am not talking about – of course I am 
20 
talking about the evidence leader and I think for me it is 
critical that clarity is put right across and out there around 
these particular issues and that is why I am saying 
Honourable Chair that I think some of the questions that 
you are asking are valid.  I may not agree with them but 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 84 of 201 
 
they are valid.  They – but it is possible that they will also 
become much more clearer as and when we deal with the 
investigation report and the two reports.  Because it is a 
wide ranging amount of work that was done there.  It 
includes issues of processing even within the whether IPID 
and some sections of the police service, the National 
Prosecuting Authority and so on.  But fundamentally it then 
deals with the disjuncture between the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you see. 
MR NHLEKO:  So for me I think that is – that is one 
10 
fundamental [indistinct 00:02:56]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you heard me earlier on I said let us 
go straight into the issue of the reports. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when I say – then we will go to the 
investigation and so on.  So I have no doubt Mr Hulley is 
looking into dealing with that.  He is dealing with that.  But 
the shorter answers you give the more progress we will 
make.  Now of course there may be situations where you 
feel you have to explain and so on but I also just need to 
20 
tell you that your counsel is here, he is here to protect your 
interests.  He is watching and when he thinks there is 
something unfair that is being done to you, he will – he is 
very experienced counsel he will look after your interest.  I 
am not saying that you may not raise an issue when you 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 85 of 201 
 
feel that there is an issue so – but let us try to the extent 
possible even when you think the question is being 
repeated if the answer is a simple one yes, yes I said so, I 
did not say so let us try and do that. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So Mr Nhleko what I am trying to 
ascertain is the very reason why it is that you had refer this 
matter to Werksmans in the first place.  As I understand it 
10 
you said that there had been allegations.  The allegations 
that you were referring to were the allegations of the 
existence of the two reports.  The two reports you had in 
front of you the – so I am trying to understand since you 
had the two reports in front of you surely you could simply 
look at the two reports yourself it might require further 
investigation after you have come to a conclusion but you 
could certainly look at the two reports yourself and 
ascertain whether quite apart because the conclusions are 
clearly different.  But you can ascertain from the two reports 
20 
what those differences are surely? 
MR NHLEKO:  Now I am trying to figure out Honourable 
Chair how do I give you a shorter answer to the [indistinct 
00:05:32] that was – I am not saying I will give you a 
prescription. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 86 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do your best. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am not - I am so vested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  How do I give you a short answer to this 
question and I think this question we have been toing and 
froing around it and so on.  Remember that this very same 
question that is being posed by Mr Hulley talks to the issue 
of the need for the docket so that we are able to go through 
this issue of the two reports.  Now – so in a way this very 
same question which had been attended to at an earlier 
10 
point it is – is being brought back and ja that is my 
somewhat of a misgiving as you can have a look at reports.  
But you need much more further details than what is written 
in the reports.  And that is where the question of 
investigation comes in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Let me ask this question.  What was 
your understanding at the time you were dealing with this 
issue as to whether IPID would be entitled to change their 
mind about recommendations that they may have made in 
an earlier report?  Do you remember whether you had a 
20 
view or you did not have a view about whether if they have 
submitted a report and later on they had a change of mind 
about any recommendation and they would be entitled to 
then 
say, 
you 
know 
we 
have 
realised 
that 
that 
recommendation is not sustainable and here is a report that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 87 of 201 
 
reflects what we consider to be our final view and 
recommendation on the matter. 
MR NHLEKO:  But Chair report does not stand from the 
recommendations. 
 
The 
recommendations 
is 
the 
final 
product of some work that would have been – that would 
have been done.  Now – an correctly so you know we kept 
on going back to this question that says okay so you have 
this report it is filed there and it is not withdrawn with the 
National Prosecuting Authority but the recommendations of 
this very same report as opposed to the report which came 
10 
later which is now the 18 March are different – why?  Now 
remember that 
I had 
spoken to the 
question of an 
institutional arrangement here which says that the – the 
prosecutors that the NPA would give them as IPID for an 
example must also be part of the generation of I suppose 
any other report if there would be after that.  Because why 
would they be involved in one report and they are not 
involved in another around the same issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  That say – that is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But my question is, are you able to 
say that at that time you had a view or you did not have a 
view on whether IPID was entitled to change its mind on 
parts of a report or on its recommendations if after they 
have submitted a report for certain reasons they realise that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 88 of 201 
 
their view or recommendation would not be sustainable or 
would not – is not justified?  Is that something that you 
know that you did have a view that they could do that or is 
it something – or you do not know whether you had thought 
about it or you know that you thought they could not do 
that? 
MR NHLEKO:  I certainly do not know whether I really 
thought about it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Except that for me the critical question was 
10 
resolving the issue of the two reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  As you sit there now as a matter of 
principle do you see anything wrong if the position – if you 
were to be told that maybe the position is that IPID would or 
was entitled if they changed their view on a report that had 
been sent for whatever reason to change or to provide a 
report that reflected their revised view.  What would you say 
about that proposition as you sit there? 
MR NHLEKO:  And I think that is very hypothetical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we have [indistinct 00:11:03] 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja but the – maybe let me try… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you – before you try. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me say. 
MR NHLEKO:  Chair. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 89 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see well for me and it may be that for 
Mr Hulley as well as for Mr Mokhari because we are in the 
legal profession but maybe not for you.  You know for me 
when I – when I heard evidence last year about this report 
from the IPID witnesses my first or one of my first questions 
was are they entitled to change their view?  Are they 
entitled if they discover for example that the report they 
have sent in has a flaw are they entitled to – to convey 
whether to the NPA or to the Minister to send a report that 
reflects their – their view after some intervening event has 
10 
happened or after they have had a chance to reflect on it 
because if they are entitled it may be that that should be 
the end of the matter?  If they are not entitled it may be that 
there should be further questions.  Another question that I 
raised when the IPID witnesses were giving evidence was 
this issue of alteration they are said to have altered a 
report.  So I said well maybe somebody will explain to me 
and maybe there is just something that is missing for me 
because you – you – for me if you have a certain report and 
maybe you – you cross out certain things maybe that is 
20 
alteration if you – there is a report then you create a 
different document – another report that seems to me it is a 
different report which may have some differences with the 
first one but maybe that is technical but it is something that 
I want to understand but let us deal with that in due course.  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 90 of 201 
 
So I come – I come back to simply the question first to say 
you as you sit there do you have a position on whether they 
were entitled to – they would have been entitled to give you 
another report if an earlier report that they had done they 
subsequent thought there was something wrong about it? 
ADV MOKHARI:  Sorry Chair I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV MOKHARI:  I just wanted to come in maybe… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  What I say may be of assistance. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  The issue of whether IPID was an entitled 
to produce another report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI:  My understanding is that it is a legal 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI:  So Mr Nhleko may give his view as I 
understand the law on the legal issue it does not matter 
what the witness say. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI:  So if the law says something else then the 
law says something else.  So maybe if he can focus on the 
facts himself then the conclusion which is going to be a 
legal conclusion will then be debated by the commission 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 91 of 201 
 
itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI:  But the commission is now going to ask 
itself a question.  What does the law say in respect of 
reports which are produced by IPID? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOKHARI:  Is IPID entitled to produce another report 
which contradicts the first one and if so what is the 
authority for that?  So that is going to be a debate among 
the lawyers. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand what you are saying.  
You will have noticed that my question was not – was 
framed with a view to getting his own understanding which 
may be right or maybe wrong.  The lawyers will debate 
whether it was right or wrong afterwards. 
ADV MOKHARI:  Okay now I understand it.  Understand 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just his own understanding.  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  I think he must answer the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MOKHARI:  Because clearly, he must have had a view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI:  And either right or wrong he must have 
had a view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is right yes. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 92 of 201 
 
ADV MOKHARI:  I think he must answer the question so 
that we can move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr 
Mokhari.   
MR NHLEKO:  I am so happy I am not a lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not be sorry for not being a lawyer.   
MR NHLEKO:  I will answer this because I want to try and 
practicalise this thing and of course I am not going to be 
legalistic as you would know I am not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  I know nothing about law.  A report of this 
nature is constituted by statements from people.  Whether 
witnesses or whatever.  So let me give you an example.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  If you take – you are [indistinct 00:16:32] a 
report and there is a Colonel Madilonga who then says, no I 
witnessed the entry of the Zimbabwean police and I picked 
up the phone and I called this particular person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Nhleko I know I am stopping 
you. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am trying to make sure we make 
progress. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is, whether at that time you 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 93 of 201 
 
had an understanding of whether they were entitled or not?  
The answer could be yes I did have an understanding and 
my understanding is they were entitled under certain 
circumstances or my understanding was they were not 
entitled.  So that is what I am asking? 
MR NHLEKO:  No I think the fair answer then to that if the 
Honourable Chair says... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  I should not try and provide a practical 
example. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Is that I had no view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes.  I had no view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Now … 
MR NHLEKO:  And could I also suggest Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh another… 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Quick break Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are at seven minutes to or nine 
minutes to one so another – I wanted to say to you that 
some people call it a comfort break but a previous witness 
in this commission long before Corona virus and Covid-19 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 94 of 201 
 
said could we have an opportunity to wash hands.  He 
wanted an opportunity to wash hands. 
MR NHLEKO:  Sanitise. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So with Covid-19 there is a lot of need 
for washing hands.  So – so I think – I think in that – there 
are two options depending on your situation.  We can go up 
to one o’clock and then take the break or if the situation is 
such that let us stop now we can stop now.  You prefer 
now? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  Yes very much so. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Let us take the 
lunch adjournment and then we will resume at two o’clock.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue and I will let you continue 
Mr Hulley just now but I just want to see if I can reach a 
certain understanding of Mr Nhleko’s evidence on some of 
20 
the issues we dealt with before lunch.  Would you not agree 
with me Mr Nhleko that speaking at in general or in terms of 
principle that it would make sense if the position was that 
IPID was entitled to give you a second report if you want to 
call it that or another report if they had given you that – they 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 95 of 201 
 
had sent out an earlier report on the same subject but 
subsequently they took the view that they have made a 
mistake in regard to some issues in the first report.  So 
speaking at a general level would you not agree with me that 
it would make sense if the position was that they – they were 
able – they were entitled to – to give you another report 
reflecting what they considered their final report? 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm.  No thank you very much Chairperson.  I 
think I tried to deal with this question earlier on by trying to 
make an example. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  And the Honourable Chair felt perhaps… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I stop you – did I stop you? 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly.  No, no he felt that I should not okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am being diplomatic Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am trying the most impossible.  Because I 
was trying illustrate this point to say if you talk of an 
investigation report an investigation report is made up of a 
20 
number of components.  You know it would be statements, it 
would be many other things and so on.  But there could be a 
circumstance where somebody who has – who has made a 
statement turns around and says, no I told a lie.  In fact, that 
thing is not true.  So I am now withdrawing my statement.  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 96 of 201 
 
You know.  I said that Mr so and so stole a goat, right?  But 
in actual fact I did not see him stealing a goat and therefore 
it is not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought it was him but I think it was 
somebody else now. 
MR NHLEKO:  You know it could be that.  Now that is a 
material factor and that material factor is bound to influence 
your conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right.  So I am veering away from what 
10 
Senior Counsel Mokhari referred to as the legal question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Entitlement versus not being entitled and so 
and so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am staying away deliberately from that but I 
am providing this practical example because I am trying to 
say that if you were an investigator and certain statements 
change and people withdraw that is bound to influence your 
conclusion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  So from a practical point of view it does make 
sense to do so.  Then you will have a different report which 
would then also refer to the first report as being changed or 
annulled for these particular reasons. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 97 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Well that is in line 
with my own sense of what I would expect to be possible 
because otherwise if they were not as a matter of principle 
entitled to give you a revised report or another report 
reflecting their latest position you could have a situation 
where you as the Minister end up making a decision for 
example that somebody must be subjected to disciplinary 
hearing on something which is based on something that had 
already realised was flawed and actually I would suggest 
that if after you have made -  if they did not bring this to 
10 
your attention by way of saying, look we have – we made a 
mistake this is – this is our view now we have reflected bla, 
bla, bla and you made a decision and maybe that decision 
was challenged and so on and so on successfully and you 
got to know that they did realise that they had made a 
mistake but they did not bring this to your attention it 
appears to me you would have grounds to be angry with 
them.  To say, why did you let me make a decision on the 
basis of something you had realised was a mistake?  You 
understand? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I understand you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it – I think therefore what this 
conversation between you and me reveals is that you and – 
you and I think that as a matter of common sense there 
would be nothing wrong in principle with changing a report or 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 98 of 201 
 
updating it or whatever you call it if there are certain things 
that might have happened.  It might be that it depends what 
it is that has happened. 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know but in principle we find nothing 
wrong with the idea of being able to say, I have realised 
there is something wrong in the first report this is what I am 
now saying. 
MR NHLEKO:  I can perhaps try and elaborate on this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Chairperson.  Just make a one formulation.  
Suppose I am writing a report to the United Nations about 
this commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  There is a difference if in the formulation say 
indeed the commission said and they check him in wearing a 
red suit and white takkies.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  That formulation is different from indeed the 
commission said but it no chairperson.  Now you are likely to 
20 
arrive at two different conclusions then.  The one conclusion 
is that yes the commission had a chair.  It is debatable 
whether the suit that he was wearing was indeed red and 
was he wearing takkies.  That is something else.  You know.  
But it is a material factor to then say the chair was not there 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 99 of 201 
 
but the commission sat and functioned.  He did then question 
the legitimacy of the structure itself.  So it is – for me just to 
you know of course elaborating on this point and the 
engagement you know the Chair and the Honourable Chair is 
having and I think that would be distinctive kind of factor 
really.  So I agree with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I think we are on the same page 
because just to make another example.  If you when you 
were Minister prepared a report and to submit to cabinet and 
after you have submitted it you realise that there was quite 
10 
some flaw or serious flaws or something like that you ought 
to be entitled to replace it with one that you are happy with. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know that is the principle.  Then of 
course in the context of this and I think Mr Hulley can take it 
from there in the context of this we need to get to the actual 
alterations to say, let us go to the so called alterations and 
see  
1. If there are alterations or 
2. What was the basis for different alterations or different 
20 
recommendations or whatever else was different? 
And then deal with that.  But before we do so Mr Hulley may 
I also put this and hear what you have to say Mr Nhleko.  As 
far as recommendations are concerned insofar as they 
related to – they may have related to criminal conduct that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 100 of 201 
 
was for the NPA to decide, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That had nothing to do with you in terms of 
how they decide but they had to decide that.  But insofar as 
matters of a disciplinary nature were concerned that fell 
within your sphere of operation you had to decide whether 
somebody needed to be disciplined or not, is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:  No correctly so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But am I also correct that you were not 
bound by the recommendations of IPID in terms of those – in 
10 
terms of their recommendations on disciplinary matters you 
would have been entitled to look at the material and make up 
your own mind, disagree with their recommendation if you 
did not think it was sound, arrive at your own decision?  Or 
is the position that once they had made a recommendation 
you did not have an option you had to implement their 
recommendation? 
MR NHLEKO:  No I think it should be remembered Chair that 
as an employer you – you have both the administrative and 
institutional duty to uphold the image of the institution.  So if 
20 
for an example one of your employees is – is facing criminal 
charges out there let me make specific that example and so 
on.  From an institutional point of view something has got to 
be done about that because there are issues of image, there 
are issues of repute, there are other issues of course related 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 101 of 201 
 
to that and so on.  So as an employer you would also have to 
look into that without necessarily saying, you are pursuing 
criminal charges because criminal charges are things that 
happen out there and so on.  And once those matters would 
have been sorted you will see how you then deal with that 
particular matter.  So I am not sure whether that would 
satisfy for an example this issue because it is a very – some 
sort of a thing divide if I may put it that way?  Because 
criminality is being pursued somewhere else by a reputable 
institution such as the NPA.  But there are issues then about 
10 
the nature of the employment and the institution that will be 
heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but that was not my question.  My 
question is, was your understanding at the time that you 
were bound by IPID’s recommendations as far as disciplinary 
matters 
were 
concerned? 
 
Namely 
if 
they 
made 
a 
recommendation that somebody must be disciplined or they 
made a recommendation that somebody should not be 
disciplined was your understanding that you were bound to 
implement their recommendations or was your understanding 
20 
that you were not bound this was simply a recommendation 
you are entitled to arrive at your own decision which could 
be that I disagree with this recommendation, this is what I 
am going to do? 
MR NHLEKO:  It – I suppose it would really depend on the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 102 of 201 
 
material factors involved but recommendations are to be 
taken seriously.  That would be my point of emphasis and so 
on.  And then take it on from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me try this.  Would your attitude 
have been that you would take IPID’s recommendations on 
disciplinary matters seriously but you would feel free to 
depart from them or not to follow them where you felt that 
they were – they were wrong?  I am trying to see to what 
extent – what was their place in your decision making? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes but the… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because from what you say we can 
exclude the possibility that you thought they meant nothing 
you could ignore them.  That is not what you are saying?  
You are saying they need to be taken seriously. 
MR NHLEKO:  You could – you could not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but I am exploring the possibility 
whether taking them seriously meant that as far as you 
understood the position you must implement them all the 
time irrespective of your view of them or whether you are 
saying I would take – I would implement them unless I felt 
20 
strongly that they were wrong. 
MR NHLEKO:  Look I would implement them.  I would 
definitely implement them but you know earlier on I was just 
thinking about how the Honourable Chair was saying there is 
a contradiction between taking something seriously but being 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 103 of 201 
 
free to do something else in the opposite you know.  So – 
but nevertheless I would take them seriously and of course 
implement them.  Now any other matter that will arise 
thereafter you know of material value for an example will 
arise out of the process.  Ja for [indistinct 00:15:53] say you 
could have a situation where a particular ex-employee is 
being accused of XY and Z okay but then as and when the 
disciplinary process is unfolding it is then discovered that 
basically this particular human individual is not as guilty as 
suggested for lack of a better word really.  So that is why I 
10 
always stress – say Honourable Chair the question of the 
process.  A disciplinary process extremely important and it 
has to be followed at all material times so that you know you 
give an opportunity to an accused person to clear himself or 
herself but also put matters out there in the open.  If there is 
exoneration there is exoneration.  If there is not there is not 
it is a different matter altogether.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  The question of and 
we will return to some of the issues that have been raised by 
20 
the Chairperson at some stage.  But for present purposes I 
am trying to understand some of your earlier answers and I 
think I do but there is some disagreement or might be some 
disagreement between me and my – the rest of my team as 
to what your answer actually is.  If I understand correctly 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 104 of 201 
 
before you decided to refer the matter to Werksmans for 
their assessment you had not at that stage actually gone 
through a process of conducting an analysis between the 
first report, the second report and the docket.  Now I am 
speaking about you personally. 
MR NHLEKO:  No but Chair we do not have to be 
individualistic about this.  The fact of the matter is that as 
Minister of Police then I was heading an institution called 
Ministry.  So you cannot have the emphasis on you 
personally.  Did you do this and so?  I mean the fact of the 
10 
matter is this.  Certain matters were brought to the fore.  
Identified you know ideally as they should have been.  You 
put them to a process and you say establish the facts around 
this.  You know.  Now  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well you see Mr Nhleko I know – I 
know I am interrupting you while you are in the middle of 
your answer. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, no you did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you actually done.  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  I just stopped there.  I just stopped. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no you see as I have said earlier, we 
will make better progress if you just answer the question.  If 
the question is had you yourself personally conducted the 
analysis and the answer is you had not you just say I had 
not.  And if you want to add but I had staff who had done so 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 105 of 201 
 
for me they gave me executive summaries that is what I have 
looked at that is fine.  Then we make progress.  Okay.   
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you – from what you have said 
it seems to me that you might not have yourself done that 
analysis but there were staff in your Ministry who had done 
that and you had the benefit of that.  Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Is that in fact correct Sir? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  It is correct Sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay so you had staff who had conducted 
the analysis. 
MR NHLEKO:  Hm. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Compared the first report to the second 
report and compared both of those against the docket? 
MR NHLEKO:  Right correctly so. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And they came to the conclusion of that 
what had happened?  Or let me ask you, what was their 
conclusion? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  No the conclusion was simple.  There was 
further work that needed to be undertaken insofar as the 
issue of the two reports.  And that is where the issue of – 
that is where the issue of the – I think about the six sort of 
areas of focus came in.  To then say look these are the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 106 of 201 
 
matters that would have to be looked into to clarify this 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No when you say areas of focus are you 
referring in fact to the ultimate questions that were put to 
Werksmans to say? 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Investigate these issues. 
MR NHLEKO:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  So a report had 
10 
been – presumably report or an executive summary or 
something had been prepared which was given to you to 
consider as the Minister which dealt with the question of 
whether – of the comparison between the two reports and 
the docket and suggested to you that there was additional 
work that needed to be done and that should be – and that is 
one of the reasons why you decided to refer the matter to 
IPID – ag pardon me to Werksmans? 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Now could you just bear with me.  And 
20 
the people that have conducted this assessment are we 
referring here to the Reference Group, are we referring to 
some legal advisors or are we referring to somebody other 
than either of those two? 
MR NHLEKO:  It is a combination really.  The Reference 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 107 of 201 
 
Group did whatever work it would do.  It would bring the 
result of the work but of course you know that is then within 
the Ministry and we would also sit and go through I mean 
such reports. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sorry did you – the people who compiled 
the Executive Summary or a report which pointed out that 
they had conducted an analysis of the two IPID reports and 
they had conducted analysis of the docket and they felt that 
there was additional work to be done.  I am looking for the 
identity of that person, persons or body?  Now you say it is a 
10 
combination I suggest to the Reference Group, I suggest 
with the legal advisor.  You say it is a combination.  A 
combination of what?  The Reference Group and the legal 
advisor? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he is saying that people from 
different units in the Ministry did some work – well I do not 
know if there was a document that ultimately was supposed – 
was given to you.  A single document or whether there may 
have been different documents from different people.  Is that 
something you are able to remember or is that something 
20 
you are not able to remember? 
MR NHLEKO:  It is possible that in certain instances there 
would be a document but by and large we would have a 
discussion and strategy sessions for an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 108 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  To look into reports and various issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  And so they then take it you know follow it on 
from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I might take you to your affidavit which 
is to be found in LEA1 at page – this is Exhibit YA – Sorry 
Y8[A] Mr Chairperson.  And the relevant portion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – that is his affidavit? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct.  The relevant portion is at 
10 
page 28.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just… 
MR NHLEKO:  Is it 28 of my affidavit or your 28? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is 28 the paragraph or the page? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  28 is the page number Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That means it is the red numbers at the 
top. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Top right hand corner.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue Mr Hulley. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If we can start in fact Mr Chairperson on 
the preceding page at page 27 at the foot of that page at 
paragraph 75.  You say that: 
“The Reference Group in dealing with the unlawful rendition 
of Zimbabwean Nationals identified that there was an 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 109 of 201 
 
investigation report by IPID conducted earlier and signed off 
on the 22 January 2012.  It also identified that there was 
another report by IPID soon after Mr Robert McBride had 
assumed his – assumed function as Executive Director of 
IPID in March 2012.  The predicament with this was that 
there were now two reports on the same subject matter of 
the rendition of the Zimbabwean Nationals each report with 
recommendations 
that 
were 
in 
contradiction 
with 
one 
another.”   
Save the last recommendation on both reports the initial 
10 
report by the Reference Group on page 7 – sorry on the 
following page paragraph 76 is: 
“The initial report by the Reference Group and also pointed 
out to the seriousness of this matter the report pointed to the 
violation of the Extradition Act, the African Union Protocol 
and the United Nations Convention among others.  It must 
also be remembered that the criminal justice cluster was 
also seized with the matter in 2012 as this matter attracted 
media and public interest after the expose by the Sunday 
Times Publication.  In 2014 when I appeared on SABC Talk 
20 
Channels for the Presentation of Crime Statistics the show 
anchor with a sudden question on renditions and asked me 
to why disciplinary steps were not being instituted against 
senior police officials such as General Dramat and others as 
they were implicated in the said report.  I undertook right 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 110 of 201 
 
there and then that I was going to follow up on the said 
complaint.  Given all these matters as they were brought to 
the 
fore 
you 
say 
I 
felt 
the 
need 
for 
more 
detailed 
investigation to clarify ourselves on these issues.  I then 
proceeded to appoint Werksmans Attorneys to conduct the 
investigation.” 
 
Now there is no mention is this then about the fact 
that you had received either an Executive Summary, a 
memorandum or even discussion from – from anybody not 
even from the Reference Group.  The only reference to the 
10 
Reference Group over here is about the fact that the 
Reference Group had spoken about the Dramat investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Hulley I am very keen for us to get to 
what the alterations were. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I am too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We must try and finish today.  This 
witness we – we – was going to testify yesterday and after 
that 
there 
would 
have 
been 
cross-examination 
of 
Mr 
McBride. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we took the whole of yesterday.  We – 
I thought we would finish before lunch.  We are now after 
lunch.  We have got to get to the real issues. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What I want to do with your – with the 
Chair’s leave.  I want to obviously get into the report – the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 111 of 201 
 
two reports and I will produce the two reports.  The thing 
that I am anxious about of course is that if the witness had 
not considered – done an assessment of the two reports then 
everything he tells after that is really based upon what the 
Werksmans Report has said as opposed to what he himself 
had done.  So I am just anxious but I will get into the report 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think just bring your 
microphone closer I missed some of the things you are 
saying. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Pardon me Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  What I – the point I am making Mr Chair 
is that I am anxious to get into the reports provided that the 
witness is himself done an assessment of the reports prior to 
Werksmans otherwise if it is the – if his assessment is based 
upon what Werksmans has done or said then Werksmans are 
the people that I must speak to and Mr July is coming to 
testify about that.  But for this witness and I understand that 
the witness has testified that he endorsed or accepted the 
20 
report and we will deal with that in a moment.  But at this 
stage I am just anxious to first ascertain the witness’ 
response of whether he himself had done or even been 
advised 
on the assessment that 
had 
been 
conducted 
between the two reports before we get into the reports. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 112 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can understand I understood earlier 
on when you asked him about whether he had personally 
done the analysis that you talked about but I am not sure 
how important that this issue is.  He took the view that there 
was an alteration of a certain report, of the first report and 
he took the view that circumstances were such that there 
should be further investigation and it seems to me that we 
are taking long to get into ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...exactly what was different between the 
10 
two reports.  So I think let us get there as soon as possible. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thanks, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If you would not mind.  We are just 
dealing with this one issue of ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  So what I am getting at Mr Nhleko, is that 
in your explanation, in fact, quite a substantial explanation, 
you mentioned... you have made no mention at all of 
receiving input from the Reference Group or from any other 
20 
body, made mention to the analyses that was done between 
the two reports, other than to identify that there were two 
different reports. 
MR NHLEKO:  A report is produced by the Reference Group.  
They bring it over to me in terms of, you know, in terms of 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 113 of 201 
 
what it is that they have found.  And the report is entitled 
ministry... no, it is a report to advise the ministry on good 
governance 
procedures 
and 
inter-governmental 
lay 
protocols.  Excuse me.  [throat clearing]  I need some water.  
My apologies Chair for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There should always be water next to the 
witness.  I think ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  I meant pure water. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  Probably Chair.  [laughs]  And so in the report 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nhleko ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  The report is titled the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  We have got other water.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  My apologies there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you thinking of isiZulu?  Because in 
isiZulu there is water that is described in a certain way. 
[laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  I know that Chair.  I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what I am talking about? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not what you mean? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, that is not what I mean. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Okay I think somebody will bring 
you water. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 114 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  No, it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can continue. 
MR NHLEKO:  We can proceed in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Thank you very much, Chair.  So the report by 
the Reference Group is entitled the... it is titled, sorry.  It is 
a 
report 
to 
advise 
the 
minister 
on 
good 
governance 
procedures and inter-government and protocols, national 
legislation, and the legality of the deportation of the 
Zimbabwean nationals by DPCI.  So... (Thank you very 
10 
much, sir.)  So in their report, they go into a number of 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, is there something for the witness to 
sanitise the bottle with there or not?  I think somebody must 
just sanitise.  I do not want the witness to later complain that 
he came to the Commission free of Covid and he left the 
Commission with Covid.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  No, thank you.  I am blessed that my 
bottle has been sanitised by a reverend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Or a priest.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is blessed water Mr Nhleko.  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  So that is what the report says.  But in the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 115 of 201 
 
briefing, they then point and they said, “Look, there are 
these issues of the question of the two reports that needs to 
be looked into”. 
 
And I think earlier on, we have spoken to the entire 
process in terms of what transpired then, the communication 
between myself and Mr McBride and so on around these 
particular matters. 
 
Now... and by the way, as a matter of principle from the 
corporate governance point of view, I disagree with the 
position that Mr Hulley seems to be advancing. 
10 
 
There 
is 
no 
way 
that 
Werksmans 
would 
have 
commissioned themselves.  There is no way.  They did not 
activate themselves.  The actual trigger is... was myself as 
the minister there. 
 
Now they were doing that work on behalf of the Minister 
of Police as per the identified Terms of Reference.  So we 
should not create an impression that when we refer to a 
Werksmans report is because I have talked about the 
Werksmans report out of their own volition.  They just went 
into that ministry portfolio of police and just did this kind of... 
20 
kind of work and so. 
 
Now, 
I 
am 
referring 
to 
principles 
of 
corporate 
governance because I think in there, the factors that you 
then as the principle in the institution, you take ownership of 
that report and the recommendations and you, you know, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 116 of 201 
 
take it on from that point of view. 
 
And so... correctly so Honourable Chair.  I am of the 
view and I fully agree with this position that says, let us then 
look into what is this work that was done in relation to the 
question of the two reports. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, Mr Hulley.  If you do not get into that, 
Mr Nhleko is going to start to believe in that you are running 
away from ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...in dealing with that. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think early in the morning, he 
made a suggestion that you want us to go into that report 
and you are not getting there.  [laughs] 
ADV HULLEY SC:  I particularly get to... just to the Terms of 
Reference which appear ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you get to the Terms of 
Reference Mr Hulley.  Let me deal with this.  Mr Nhleko 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MR NHLEKO:  I hear the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the one thing that we know is that in 
the second report with regard to General Dramat and is it... 
and General Sibiya?  I am not sure. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 117 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their recommendation was that there no 
criminal... there should be no criminal prosecution.  There 
should be no disciplinary action.  Is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]  
MR NHLEKO:  ...that is what was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  But in the first report, the 
recommendation included that they should be charged 
criminally and there should be disciplinary action with regard 
to them ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  ...as well. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And others. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now, on its own, based on our 
previous... my previous interaction with you earlier on, I take 
it that, on its own, that should not be a problem in terms of a 
general principle. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what may have made you think that 
there 
might 
be 
something 
untoward 
here. 
 
There 
is 
something that needs further investigation, might well be 
what else was changed.  If you call it change.  Is that right? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes, that is correct. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 118 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With us going into the report without us 
going into the report, are you able to say, “Look, for 
example, for me in regard to the first report, this is what they 
had said but in the second report that was no longer there”.  
That seems to be quite important to me.  I am saying, you 
can deal with that without going to the report if you are able 
to but if you want to go into the report and say one, two, 
three and other things that worried me about this. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m.  Honourable Chair, I would venture to 
say that we would have to zoom straight into the table that 
we have provided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Because the table we have provided, then tell 
you ...[intervenes] ‘ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...this is what was said in this particular 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  And this is what appeared to be an alteration 
on this other end and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Shall we go there Mr Hulley?  And 
then please, do not forget the question you wanted to ask. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 119 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted us to cross this river at this 
stage.  Which one? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We have got to go to Bundle Y8A.  Sorry.  
Pardon, Mr Chair.  It is LEA now 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  LEA(1) 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Actually, we do have... it depends.  We 
do in his own affidavit, he has put a table.  Unless if you 
want to refer to something else? 
CHAIRPERSON:  In his own affidavit? 
10 
MR MOKHARI SC:  In his own affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what page? 
MR MOKHARI SC:  It starts at page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I thought I have seen it in his affidavit 
too. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes.  It is page 50. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red numbers? 
MR MOKHARI SC:  The red number at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five, zero.  Okay.  Yes.  No. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes, it is at zero, five, zero. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr Mokhari. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes, that is where it starts, paragraph 
150. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOKHARI SC:  Yes. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 120 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  At page 50, there it says “deletion 
of evidence from the first report”.  And then on the left 
column it is IPID Report 1.  On the second column it is IPID 
Report 2.   
MR NHLEKO:  In reference to that Chair, meaning IPID 
Report 1 is 22 January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And IPID Report 2 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the ...[indistinct]  
MR NHLEKO:  ...is 18 March. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...18 March.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that is my understanding of it.  Mr 
Hulley, do you want to ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...take it and run with it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  If I understand you correctly sir.  What 
you have done over here is, you have basically cut from the 
report of Werksmans and you have paste into your affidavit.  
Would that be correct? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, that is correct your Honourable Chair. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  And there has been no... you have not 
added or deleted from the Werksmans report or their 
assessment?  In other words, you have accepted lock, stock 
and barrel? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 121 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I have not deleted anything. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay.  So let us consider it at the top of 
page 51.  On page 50, you start with the analyses but there 
is no analyses that appears on page 50.  Page 51 is where 
the analyses begins.  Would you like to take us through it. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, thank you very much Honourable 
Chairperson.  What I would attempt to do.  I would deal with 
the column on the first report and then take that letter then 
across to the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  The... on the first column, the first report, the 
report of the 22n d of January, on page 9 which is a statement 
by a... I think a colonel at the time, Ndanduleni Richard 
Madilonga.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR NHLEKO:  That the law states as follows in the relevant 
paragraphs: 
“Superintendent Ncube told him that he was going to 
Pretoria to meet General Dramat.  He said to him that 
maybe he knew about the chief superintendent who 
20 
had been murdered.   
He said that the suspects who were in Gauteng and 
he had organised with General Dramat to assist them 
in tracing the suspects...” 
 
That paragraph stays the same on the second report.  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 122 of 201 
 
The second paragraph in the first report, then goes on and it 
says: 
“He will state that he told Superintendent Ncube that 
he 
has 
to 
verify 
with 
his 
seniors 
about 
the 
arrangements. 
He was given a number of General Dramat by 
Superintendent 
Ncube. 
 
He 
called 
Colonel 
Ratsonani(?) [00:13:42] to verify the information and 
she 
requested 
that 
he 
should 
call 
Brigadier 
Magushu(?) [00:13:50] who was the Provincial Head 
10 
Protection and Security Services. 
He then called him on the cell phone and explained 
to him that there are police from Zimbabwe who are 
intending to have a meeting with General Dramat. 
Brigadier Magushu told him that he was not aware of 
the visit but if the people are saying that they are 
going to meet the general, he should call General 
Dramat directly. 
He phoned General Dramat on his cell phone and he 
responded 
by 
saying that 
he is 
aware 
of the 
20 
Zimbabwean Police and he must let them come...” 
 
That 
is 
Colonel 
Ndanduleni 
Richard 
Madilonga 
...[intervenes]   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...on report 1.  Now on report 2 ...[intervenes]  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 123 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  On report 2 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
MR NHLEKO:  The paragraph that follows the above.  In 
other words, the above is the first paragraph as stated, has 
been deleted.  It is then replaced by the following words in 
there: 
“For the period of two weeks, he never heard 
anything from Superintendent Ncube and his group.  
After 
two 
weeks, 
he 
received 
a 
call 
from 
10 
Superintendent Ncube who told him that he was in 
town and he wanted to say goodbye. 
He went to town and met with them in front of Tops 
Bottle Store.   
They bought liquor and they left to the border.  He 
did not escort them.  They went to the border and 
crossed to Zimbabwe...” 
 
So effectively, the paragraph in the statement by Colonel 
Madilonga which starts with “he will state”, that paragraph in 
its entirety is deleted and replaced by what I have just read 
20 
out.  Now at page 21, paragraph 5.2 which reads: 
“Success report dated the 4 t h of February 2011.  This 
report is addressed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Are you now at 
page 53?  What page are you on? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 124 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  It is the following page from where I have 
started off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, we started at page 51 and then... 
MR NHLEKO:  What is your...? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is 53 Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  You have got to look at the top right at 
the corner. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, part of the problem Chair, it is my 
apologies.  The file in question.... I think they are looking it 
10 
up for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am using my state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes.  So it is... the statement is outside of 
your pagination.  Let me put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  So maybe for purposes of clarifying that 
question ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, has somebody given the witness the 
20 
file?  The file... the witness must have the same file that we 
have.  Each time I am given a file, he must be given a file.  
Oh, they will give it to you.  They will ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  No, no, no.  It is there. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 125 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...give it just to you now. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, they are very good to me Honourable 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  I must state.  He is the only person that 
organised 
me 
a 
cup 
of 
coffee 
during 
lunch 
at 
this 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  So this Commission is not so 
bad, hey?  [laughs] 
MR NHLEKO:  [laughs]  I suppose ...[indistinct] members of 
10 
the Commission.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
[laughs] 
 
And 
I 
suspect 
that 
the 
Chairperson might have been one of them. 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And by the way, Mr Hulley also... I mean, 
really.  I got a chicken and mayo sandwich yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  What page is it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the columns start at page 50 but the 
20 
actual paragraphs start at page 51. 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh, of my statement.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your statement, ja.  But when I say 50 
and 51, I am talking about the red numbers at the top corner 
of each page. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 126 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay.  So I have already dealt with the page 
51. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja, I have already dealt with page 51.  So 
basically, I went over to page 52. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you read page 52 as well. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right.  So I am now on page 53 of that file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So... so... ja, ja. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you proceed.  I just want to get 
this because I did not get it, just to check it.  When you talk 
about alterations of certain paragraphs, you are not talking 
about alteration of the actual statement or statements of the 
witnesses but you are talking about alteration of IPID’s 
report based on what the statements of witnesses say?  Is 
that right?  In other words, if in Madilonga for an example 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...when we talk about a change of certain 
paragraphs, we are not talking about, saying he had signed a 
statement which said A, B, C, D. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody in... at IPID went to that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 127 of 201 
 
statement and removed a paragraph and put in a para... 
another paragraph in a statement that had been signed.  You 
are simple saying that in IPID’s report where they referred to 
Mr Madilonga, this is what they said and then in the first 
report. 
MR NHLEKO:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the second report, they have put in 
something else in the report, not in the statement. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, my understanding is exactly that.  I am... 
the statements were contained, I think, in the docket. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  They signed as they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  But in the reports, in the production of the 
report and/or reports, then we had this particular direct, sort 
of the extracts from the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  No, I just wanted us to 
...[indistinct]  I think we are on the same page then. 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you can continue. 
MR NHLEKO:  I can continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, continue. 
MR NHLEKO:  So paragraph 21... paragraph 5.2 reads the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 128 of 201 
 
success report dated the 4t h of February 2011.  This report is 
addressed 
to 
General 
Dramat, 
Setwayo(?) 
and 
Toka 
[00:21:21]. 
 
The relevant paragraphs of the success report reads as 
follows and I quote this paragraph: 
“The report base reference 1402/01 and was sent by 
Colonel Leonie Verster...” 
 
Paragraph A.1. of the report states that: 
“On the 5t h of November 2010, General Dramat held a 
meeting with the Zimbabwean Police at the DCP 
10 
offices about the nationals who shot and killed one of 
their senior officers...” 
 
Paragraph 3 states that: 
“Captain Maluleke(?) [00:22:03] was tasked to trace 
an arrest, the said nationals.  The report also covers 
the arrest of Gordon Ncube and appreciation of TRT 
members and members of Crime Intelligence...” 
 
That paragraph in the second report is deleted and the 
paragraph 
beginning 
with 
the 
report, 
bears 
reference 
1402/01 from the first report is deleted in the second report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  At paragraph 21...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, before we go to paragraph 21 Mr 
Nhleko.  I just want us to... I first want to put this question 
before we move on because it might affect how I look at the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 129 of 201 
 
rest of the matters in the columns.   
 
If the position was that the statements of the witnesses 
with regard to the Rendition matter were provided to you and 
they were in the docket and then there was this report which 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
based 
on 
those 
statements 
...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...I would take it that you would not have 
made any decision in regard to the disciplinary matters 
without looking at the actual statements themselves. 
10 
 
When I say without looking at them, it may be that you 
would not personally look at them but if you are not going to 
personally look at them, I would imagine that you would get 
somebody within the ministry to look at them and maybe give 
you an executive summary or something. 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right in thinking along those lines?  
That you would not make a decision, for example, that 
somebody must be suspended purely on the basis of the 
IPID report without going into the statements themselves? 
20 
MR NHLEKO:  But Chair, that is... I think here we may have 
a little bit of a disagreement with you around there.  Maybe a 
different understanding to that, I do not know.  But the point 
is.  That is why I had to commission, for an example, 
Werksmans to then say, “Do some detail work”. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 130 of 201 
 
 
And of course, on the basis of which they had to also... 
there was no way that they would do... deal with this kind of 
work without, for an example, having the two reports but also 
the file above that, the question of the docket and the 
relevant information.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me put it this way.  My 
understanding is that your concern ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...at some stage possible, maybe before 
you referred the matter to Werksmans, your concern was that 
10 
there may have been an attempt on the part of one or more 
people at IPID to prevent you taking disciplinary action 
against General Dramat and maybe General Sibiya. 
 
Or to prevent the NPA from coming to a decision that 
General Dramat and General Sibiya should be prosecuted 
and that is why there was this so-called alteration to move 
away from a recommendation that said they should be 
charged criminally.   
 
They should be charged in terms of departmentally to a 
position where the second report said they should not be 
20 
charged criminally.  They should not be disciplined. 
 
But my understanding is that you were concerned that 
there may well have been that intent on the part of 
somebody, one or more people at IPID and that is part of the 
reason why you wanted this to be investigated.  Is my 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 131 of 201 
 
understanding correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now for me, the question that arises is if 
the statements of the witnesses, including Madilonga in this 
case, which are really the instruments that have the 
evidence. 
 
If they have the evidence that somebody must be 
charged, those are the documents that contain the evidence.  
10 
If there is no evidence that somebody be charged, that is... 
those are the documents that you do not have. 
 
Now, I wonder why it could be thought that somebody at 
IPID by changing something in their report without the actual 
documents that contain the evidence, being changed. 
 
Why it was thought that somebody could be trying maybe 
to defeat the ends of justice or something like that, when the 
actual statements remained the same.   
 
Because I would have thought that even though the 
reports are there, the decision makers, whether it was 
20 
yourself in regard to disciplinary matters or the NPA in 
regard to criminal matters, I do not see them making a 
decision without looking at the statements. 
 
And if... and IPID, I 
would imagine, 
would 
have 
understood that, you know, that we have got our report but 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 132 of 201 
 
the decisions cannot be taken just by... on the base of our 
report only.  The decision makers will look at the actual 
statements as well. 
 
And therefore, if they look at the statements, they will 
see the true evidence of what it says and if there is a conflict 
between the statements and the report, they would rely on 
the statements because the compilers of the report - we are 
not witnesses to the events, to the incidents.  The actual 
witnesses are the people who signed the statements. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I hear you, honourable Chairperson, I 
10 
am certain that maybe at a particular point I did not maybe 
look at it that way but remember that what you have just 
said still does not necessarily resolve the issue.  The issue 
would still be if in the original file you still have the 
original statements that say something else, why then in 
your report which then accompanies a particular file the 
articulation is different from – to that very same issue.  I 
would not necessarily take it away. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it might change, if one looks – 
somebody might give me a wrong summary of a certain 
20 
document, so I read the summary and then I go to the 
document.  When I read the document I realise that it may 
have some mistakes, it is not accurate but if I have access 
to both, I will tell them, you know, this summary of yours if 
flawed, this is not what is in the report and I might leave it 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 133 of 201 
 
at that or I might say well, maybe next time I am not going 
to rely on your summary because it looks like you cannot 
give me a summary that I can rely on but if it is – it is 
different, it seems to me, if all I am going to have is his 
summary but if I am going to have available to me the 
statements as well and I am expected to read them before I 
make the decision, I will pick up that there is some 
inaccuracies on his summary but then once I have picked 
that up I will rely on the statements and not on his report. 
Actually, I can throw it away and rely on the statements. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Again, I hear you, Chair, and I appreciate 
that, except that that it is much more simpler.  Suppose in 
your office you have a report writer, so your report writer 
deletes information that is brought to you.  Okay?  You are 
bound to react far stronger than you have suggested to 
then saying but this summary of your is not okay, want to 
adjust this that are here and there, so you are bound to 
ask a different question.  The question would be why did 
you delete this information?  You see?  So I am then 
saying it – to still require you to demand accountability 
20 
around that issue because then there is the element of the 
pollution of facts, amongst other things.  And it would – if 
that was somewhat allowed to have a – let us say you are 
provided with that summary with deleted information it 
would mislead you as the principal.  I am just making an 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 134 of 201 
 
example.   
So much as I hear the example that you have just 
spoke to, I think it is a much simpler kind of an example as 
opposed to the kind of matter that we are dealing with 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I am quite happy that we look at 
that but maybe it is good that you put it that way to say 
maybe my example is simpler because part of what I am 
trying to understand is why – why is it that something that 
on the face of this appears or may appear to have been a 
10 
simple thing?  Why did it end up being such a big almost 
national issue, you know, this thing about these reports?  
So it is part of what I am trying to understand and that is 
part of the reason why I put this question so that I can get 
your perspective to say this is how I looked at it.  When I 
say this, this is what it said to me and as a result of that – 
because this is what it said to me, this is the decision I 
made and this is how I dealt with it, so it is part of trying to 
look at that.  But I interrupted while you were comparing 
simply because I wanted to get this understanding from 
20 
you, which I have got. 
MR NHLEKO:   But let me just add quickly, Chair, to then 
say perhaps also when we deal with this section and deal 
with the process as well it would be just a question of the 
two columns.  I think most of the thing will also become 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 135 of 201 
 
clearer, you know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   As and when we proceed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed.  No, let us proceed. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   Paragraph 21 – that paragraph 5.3, emails 
by Captain Maluleke.  The email quoted, states the 
following: 
“He sent emails circulating more than 24 photos of 
10 
both 
the 
suspects 
arrested 
and 
the 
members 
involved in the operation.  The emails were sent to 
the PA of Dramat, Phumla, Zimbabwe Police and 
members of Crime Intelligence.” 
That is what the first report says.  The same paragraph in 
the so-called second report does not mention all the 
individuals to which the emails were sent to.  It reads: 
“He sent emails circulating more than 24 photos of 
both 
the 
suspects 
arrested 
and 
the 
members 
involved in the operation.  He sent email to the 
20 
Zimbabwean Police trying to find out how they 
travelled back home and that he is still tracing the 
remaining suspects.” 
So same paragraph but two different contents, okay?  On 
page 22 of the first report the letter to stakeholders dated 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 136 of 201 
 
the 20 t h …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, before we got to paragraph 
22. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you have just read related 
to paragraph 21, is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, that is the wrong page, paragraph 5.3 
of the first report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, page 21.  If you take what was said 
in the first report there, page 21, about Mr Maluleke and 
10 
what was – page said there in the second report: 
“On the understanding that what was said in the 
first report was specific in terms of who exactly the 
emails were sent to.” 
But – oh, okay, well maybe I should say what it does not – 
what the second report does not say, it does not make a 
reference to say – it does not say the emails were sent to 
the PA of Dramat, Phumla. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The second report says he sent emails 
20 
to Zimbabwean Police.  So it leaves out members of Crime 
Intelligence and Mr Dramat’s PA which I specifically 
mentioned in the first report, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the difference between the two. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 137 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   That is the difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now is it not true that any decision-
maker who having read the second report and even being 
aware of the first report maybe, at the time of reading the 
statements before making the decision, he or she would 
come across exactly the same information.   
MR NHLEKO:   I think it takes us back to the point you 
raised earlier on, is it not, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Yes, it does, I am trying 
to connect. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think your answer would be yes, he 
would come across the same information in the statements. 
MR NHLEKO:   You mean in the original statements?  I 
think that was your point earlier on, to then say you have 
the pack of original statements somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   But in the production of the report he 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes – ja, I am talking about what you 
20 
call original statements.  I do not want to call them original 
statements.  
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it may give the impression that 
there are other unoriginal statements so I am just saying 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 138 of 201 
 
statements. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So what I am suggesting to you is 
that even though in the second report on page 21 it is not 
stated that he sent emails to Mr Dramat’s PA and members 
of the Crime Intelligence, it is only said he sent emails to 
the Zimbabwean Police.  The decision-maker, whether it is 
NPA or yourself, who would read the statements would 
come across the same information mainly that statements – 
emails were sent to the PA of Mr Dramat as well as to 
10 
members of the Crime Intelligence. 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the suggestion I make. 
MR NHLEKO:   I hear your point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Save to say that you still remain with the 
question, why is that matter put differently in the others. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, that …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   In the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I accept that but we are on the same 
20 
page that the authors of the second report would know that 
anyone who took care to read the statements would 
actually get the full picture because the making the 
decision. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 139 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   is that right? 
MR NHLEKO:   I hear you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair, perhaps I can – if I can just 
explore some of that because I was going to leave it until 
the end but if I could explore some aspects of that just 
very briefly.  What we understand from your testimony thus 
far, Mr Nhleko, is that the 22 January report read in a 
particular way, which was different from the 18 March 
report, the 22 January report itself, nothing was deleted 
10 
from that report, it still remained in existence.  The 18 
March report had words that were similar to the 22 January 
report but some words have been removed, other words 
have been added and the recommendation was different.  
So you have got two reports, not one report with words 
deleted from the report, correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja, that is correct.  You are getting it right. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the 22 – the 18 March report does 
not purport to be the 22 January report, does it?  In other 
words, it does not say that – on the report itself, it is not 
20 
written 22 January, it is written 18 March. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I am losing you there.  I mean, you 
seem now to be suggesting that – does that question take 
us back to the question whether we should be talking about 
two reports or one report? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 140 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Exactly, this report, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But it may be important but I just 
wanted to make sure that that is where it takes us to. 
MR NHLEKO:   And I would still suggest, honourable Chair, 
that look, let us deal with these particular inconsistencies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, we will, we will, ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   And then, of course, we will come to the 
actual debate and discussion on these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine. 
MR NHLEKO:   And of course I think for instance as and 
10 
when, you know, I have been presiding I hear certain 
articulations from the side of the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   So – and of course I may agree, I may not 
agree with …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   That will be part of, you know, further 
engagement this one, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, it is part of – ja, it is – as I 
see it, my approach is, certainly from my side, I am trying 
20 
to get verifications. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I want to be able to see if I can 
see the matter from the angle of the IPID witnesses and 
then also look at it from your side as Minister in charge of 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 141 of 201 
 
Police.   So, therefore, for these clarifications.  But I think 
let us go through - maybe the sooner we finalise what the 
alterations were… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A bit better and then we can come back 
and deal with issues arising from that. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, thank you very much, honourable 
Chair.  On page 22, a letter to stakeholders dated the 20 
August 2012 the letter states: 
“Letter to stakeholders” 
10 
Dated 20 August 2012.  The letter was generated the same 
day indicating that: 
“In August 2010 General Sibiya and General Dramat 
went to Zimbabwe to discuss matters of cooperation 
on cross border crimes.  General Sibiya was 
appointed as the coordinator on the cooperation 
issue between the two countries.” 
Other letters  about the arrests of Zimbabwean national in 
connection with the murder of Zimbabwean Police refers to 
the cooperation agreed during the same meeting.” 
20 
Now on what is paginated as page 21 on the second 
report – and in this report the names of the people 
involved in the cooperation with the Zimbabwean Police are 
no longer mentioned.  The letter reads thus in the report, 
same title: 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 142 of 201 
 
“Letter to stakeholders” 
Dated 20 August 2012.  I quote: 
“The letter was generated the same day indicating 
to the trip to Zimbabwe to discuss matters of 
cooperation on cross-border crimes.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   That is how that – now we are in the 
second report.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   That paragraph looks like that.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we proceed I think if in regard to 
that particular alteration there is something that we need 
to deal with, let us deal with it as we go along because 
maybe if we wait until the end it might be difficult but then 
we just deal with – let me just say to you, Mr Nhleko, on 
the face of it, it seems to me – I mean, in the first report 
you have quite a detailed paragraph or a portion whereas 
in the second one – in the second report you just have one 
20 
sentence which could mean that somebody decided why do 
you have to put in all these details, try and condense 
yourself, for argument’s sake, try and condense your 
report.  I mean, some people are quite particular and I 
guess in this case remember that the first report, as I 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 143 of 201 
 
understand the position, Mr Khuba had done it without, if I 
recall correctly, without any input from Mr Sesoko.  I may 
be mistaken, but certainly without any input I think from Mr 
McBride because Mr McBride had not arrived at IPID yet 
and then the third – the second report it appears that all 
three of them got involved.  So I am just mentioning what 
is going on in my mind.  You might wish to say something 
about them. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Chair …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   No …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Sorry, Chair, maybe before he 
responds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   I was just scrolling down this, I see 
that is very long, it is a very long table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you suggest that we go through it. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Ja, if he is going to go through it, the 
whole of it and – I just want to find out from the evidence 
leaders, that if – then, I mean, if the position – because 
when I looked at the report, I mean, the table, the first 
20 
report and the second report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   What is there is that the second 
report – I mean, where in the first report there was 
reference to General Dramat and Sibiya? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 144 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   The second report removes them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   So it does not refer to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   So if the evidence leaders agree that 
first – and the first report and the second report are 
identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:    Except that the second report has in 
10 
certain instances where there is reference to Dramat and 
Sibiya, they removed that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:    And if – and that is accepted 
because these are tables that comes from the report of 
Werksmans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Then there is no need for Mr Nhleko 
then to go through the issue, then will be really at the end 
as to why Dramat and Sibiya’s names were removed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   And then whether that constituted 
misconduct or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, I think it links with a 
question that I had asked earlier but I think we had some 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 145 of 201 
 
discussion, Mr Nhleko and I, and I ended up not going back 
to it.  What I had sought to ask was, in terms of the 
alterations, what really did you regard as important, you 
know, you say one, then you say A, B, C, that is what was 
important, there may have been other alterations but they 
were, in my view, neither here nor there.  This is what was 
of concern to me. 
 
Now it may be that it is exactly what Mr Mokhari has 
been saying, it may be that it is something else.  If you say 
look, every reference to General Dramat, which had been 
10 
in the first report from a certain page to a certain page was 
removed, that is what was of concern to me, then we can 
deal with that and I think there may be merit in what Mr 
Mokhari is saying to say there may be no need to go 
through everything if you are able to capture what was of 
concern to all the alterations. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  No, thanks Chair, I’ll do, just four areas 
if not five somewhere there just to illustrate this point.  In 
the first report, now let’s go to page 60, I think, of Mr 
Nhleko’s statement.    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 60, ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay, now in the first report – I’m not sure 
whether the Chair is following. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are at the bottom part of page 60 
where it says, Khuba’s findings…[intervenes]. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 146 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   Oh, ja, thanks very much page 29 and other 
things of Dramat’s cell phone records is recorded by Khuba 
as – he says, that is Khuba, these are his words, 
 
“An evaluation of the above findings, in the entire 
said record General Dramat requested for the period of the 
20 t h  2010 to 28 t h February 2011, the number 015 534 6300 
only 
appears 
once 
which 
rules 
out 
any 
form 
of 
communication before the 4 t h of November 2010 and after 
the said date. This supports his version that he called 
Lieutenant 
General 
Dramat 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
10 
Zimbabwean policy”, 
And then in the second report, on the same issue of 
Khuba’s findings on Dramat there’s a complete 
deletion there, nothing is said, okay, that is one 
example. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja.   
MR NHLEKO:   The second example on the issue of the 
operation Khuba made the following findings in this 
respect, in his words, 
“An evaluation of the above findings the success 
20 
report signed by Leonie Verster was traced to 
Lieutenant Colonel Maluleka’s laptop as picked from 
the 
retrieved 
deleted 
data. 
 
The 
report 
was 
amended on 26 January 2011 and what appears to 
be, that is me saying 31 s t January 2011, before it 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 147 of 201 
 
could be emailed to a female officer, Warrant 
Officer Thabiso Mafatla on the 9 t h of February 2011 
at 14h32.  There is no material difference between 
the document retrieved from the laptop and that 
found at the Hawks offices during the investigation.  
This proves that Leonie Verster did not generate 
success report but only signed the report drafted by 
Colonel Maluleka, the date of the meeting between 
the Zimbabwean Police and General Dramat which 
took place on the 5 t h of November 2010 coincide 
10 
with the date on the 4 t h of November 2010 which, 
according to cell phone records, General Dramat 
was called at 20h56 by Lieutenant Colonel Maluleka 
seeing permission to allow Zimbabwean Police 
Officers to enter into the country.  Since the 
Zimbabwean Police were at Beitbridge between 
20h00 and 21h00 it is logical that they arrived in 
Gauteng 
late 
at 
night 
leaving 
them 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
have 
the 
meeting 
with 
General 
Dramat, in the morning of the 5 t h of November 2010 
20 
as stated in the success report”. 
Now, in the second report, absolutely nothing is 
said about that.  The third area the first report of the 22 n d 
of January deals with the committed Government resources 
into 
the 
operation, 
Khuba 
makes 
the 
following 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 148 of 201 
 
finding…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry are you at 62, am I correct?    
MR NHLEKO:   Yes at – no at 61, honourable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   6-1? 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja it’s – no 62, sorry yes, the one on top, 
I’m sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MR NHLEKO:   It’s difficult to follow these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   The committed Government resources into 
10 
the operation.  Now Khuba makes the following finding, I 
quote, 
“Despite the fact that General Dramat, as an 
accounting officer, did not sign any claim of Captain 
Maluleka delegating responsibility to Major General 
Sibiya to assist the Zimbabwean Police in tracing 
wanted suspects, invariably commit Government 
resources into an unlawful operation that amount to 
a criminal offence”.  
 
Now in the second report nothing is said of this very 
20 
same paragraph so there’s a complete deletion there.  
Now, congratulating, in the first report, there’s a heading 
that says, congratulating the officers for the arrest of John 
Nyoni.  Khuba makes the following finding in this regard, I 
quote, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 149 of 201 
 
“An evaluation of the above findings, words of 
appreciation 
from 
General 
Dramat 
show 
both 
interests in the arrest of the Zimbabwean Nationals 
and 
his 
knowledge 
of 
the 
operation. 
 
If 
the 
operation was lawful, he would not have warned 
them not to tell anyone about it”.  
 
Now the same heading in the second report, nothing 
is said completely about this particular matter so there’s a 
complete deletion there.  On the heading titled, he 
received communication regarding success reports and 
10 
photos of the operation through his personal assistant 
Phumla the investigator makes the following point, Mr 
Khuba, 
“According to the information received from the 
seized 
laptop, 
Captain 
Maluleka 
sent 
emails 
circulating 
more 
than 
20 
photos 
of 
both 
the 
suspects arrested and the members involved in the 
operation.  The emails were sent to the PA of 
General Dramat, Phumla, the Zimbabwean Police 
and members of Crime Intelligence”. 
20 
Corresponding to the second report nothing is said about 
this particular matter so there’s a complete deletion.  So, 
of course, there’s a whole range of other deletions but I 
think following the understanding between the honourable 
Chair and Senior Counsel who carries it, you don’t want me 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 150 of 201 
 
to bore you with this but I’ve made four examples of the 
deletion.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   And that’s why, then, Chair, my issue was if 
you come across something like this, what do you do.  Now 
if I were to say to you make a decision, and I think this is a 
point I was – I said earlier on to say, look, there are no 
cosmetic, dramatical kind of changes that we are dealing 
with here, we are dealing with material. So, surely the 
complete 
deletion 
of 
a 
particular 
paragraph 
and/or 
10 
statement for an example in a report that you would have 
to decide, let’s say as a Prosecuting Authority for an 
example it would certainly influence the kind of position 
that you would have to take and that’s why I was saying 
earlier on, making this example that, if I’m writing a report 
to the United Nations about this Commission, it’s of 
material value whether the Chair was sitting presiding over 
the proceedings of this Commission and that’s different 
from, yes, the Chair was there but he was wearing red 
glasses, I don’t know why I’m – I like red and ja, but I’m 
20 
just saying there’s a material difference in that.  So – and 
this is what we should, essentially, be concerned about as 
to why you have this kind of a situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, what is the message that these 
so-called deletions gave you or what is the message that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 151 of 201 
 
these deletions gave you, what did you make of this 
because that must be what informed your next action?  I 
told you, I think, earlier or yesterday or today that my 
inclination would have been to call them, to call the 
Executive Director and say, please explain to me what this 
is all about but maybe before I do that I would look at the 
statements and if the statements were intact then whatever 
I did with this may have been based on saying, do I think 
that it was a wrong analysis of the statements, wrong 
analysis of the issues that may have led to a wrong 
10 
recommendation or do I – did I think it’s something else, so 
what did you make of it?  Do you think it may just be some 
innoxious deletion or did you think there is something 
behind it and if so, did you think that after looking at the 
statements 
or 
without 
looking 
at 
the 
statements 
themselves? 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, the way I viewed this, that these are 
serous acts of misconduct, total deletions right.  Now, you 
are bound to develop some theoretical framework for 
example in your mind that firstly and foremost there’s 
20 
something untoward about something like this when you 
come across an analysis of this nature but also you’re 
bound to also conclude that it’s possible that there was a 
cover-up of sorts.  Now, as to why there would be that 
cover-up it’s a different process that would then have to 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 152 of 201 
 
establish that, you know.  You only remain at the level of 
being suspicious, the day there’s something wrong.  Now – 
and that’s why, Chair, for me, I think I am on record at 
different sort of platforms for an example because I said, 
look there has got to be accountability about something 
like this so that also, the people implicated themselves are 
able to either clear their names and/or, whatever differently 
but you need an objective process to handle something like 
that.  It cannot even be a person like myself, regardless of 
whatever experience that I think I might have around 
10 
matters of this nature and so on but objectively take it out 
somewhere, get professional and objective people to deal 
with the matters of this particular nature and so on.  
So that we – we’ll have to get to the bottom of what 
actually happened and why.  Now, I will possibly, disclose 
briefly one of my discussions, when the issue of, for an 
example, General Dramat who then said in his first letter to 
me and subsequently in further engagement and said, he 
wanted us to sit down and discuss about his options in 
terms of, you know, leaving the service and so on and at 
20 
one particular point we met in my office, I think it must 
have been down in Cape Town and we spoke about this 
very same, sort of matter and so on and I said to him, look, 
I don’t have an interest in you necessarily leaving the 
service I have an interest in knowing, you know, of course 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 153 of 201 
 
through the correct processes in terms of what happened 
and of course you – as you would appreciate, Chair,  you 
can’t tell an employee whether to remain and stay behind 
or leave, I mean, it’s not your call it’s an individual choice 
that a person makes.  So – because I was trying to say to 
him, and perhaps to anybody else who has to hear this 
thing, that you can’t have an institution or institutions of 
Governance that function and anything that happens and 
seems 
to 
be 
untoward 
and 
so 
on 
and 
there’s 
no 
accountability and when you want accountability around 
10 
some of those issues – and by the way, issues of 
accountability it cuts both ways. If I do something wrong, I 
expect to be correct, for an example and to be subjected to 
processes of our law, processes of our instruments of – 
within the institutions and so on.   
Now, that’s my natural expectation around these 
particular matters but I think there has been this peddling 
of a view that says, you don’t like certain people and you 
want to get rid of the, you know, at all costs and so on 
which is absolutely not true.  For me it was just a simple 
20 
exercise, these are the allegations that are out there, that 
you tampered with the report, face a legal process that has 
to got to deal with matters of that nature go and clear 
yourself, your name there, that’s it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I’m happy we have come to this 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 154 of 201 
 
point because I think it’s quite an important point.  You say 
you thought to yourself that this could be an attempt to 
cover-up okay, is that right, that there is a possibility. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, suspicions in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Suspicions ja, now, I go back to this 
question and maybe you did answer it but, whether at the 
time of doing – of having that suspicion whether you were 
aware that the statements in the docket had all the 
information, for example, that may have been in the first 
report but was no longer in the second report. Were you 
10 
aware of that or were you not aware of that at that time? 
MR NHLEKO:   No at that time, of course I wasn’t aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You weren’t aware? 
MR NHLEKO:   But I think, also, on this issue, and I’m 
happy that Mr Sandile July of Werksmans will also be 
appearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Because he would shed more light. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR NHLEKO:   On the, you know, the nitty gritty’s of the 
20 
work that they did and of course what is it that they found, 
for an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   In the docket that they looked into and the 
statements that were there, it does that, whether or not 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 155 of 201 
 
those statement tally with the final product as found in the 
two reports, for an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what would you say to the 
proposition that it would be a very weak attempt on the 
part of anybody at IPID to try and cover-up what General 
Dramat and General Sibiya may have done wrong by 
changing what was in their first report without changing the 
actual statements on the basis of which decisions would be 
made, what would you say to that? 
MR NHLEKO:   Whether or not, I would think that’s a weak 
10 
attempt? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR NHLEKO:   Whether or not I would of that as a weak 
attempt? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes to say, these people must be 
knowing what they are doing and they must have known, 
nobody was going to make a decision without reading the 
statements and it doesn’t help to change something in the 
report, if in the statement, it remains there because the 
people who make decision will look at the statements and 
20 
will see all the information that you are trying to remove, if 
that’s your attempt.  
MR NHLEKO:   No, I think I would share in a more or less 
a similar view, Chairperson that, you know,  if there’s 
something that – for argument sake you 
wanted to 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 156 of 201 
 
manipulate you needed to manipulate the entire line all the 
way back, for an example and that’s why I’m also going 
back to the point that says I’m happy that Mr July would 
appear here because then we will also be looking into the 
process issues and some of the process issues, they also 
affect the National Prosecuting Authority and so forth.  
There was the whole question, for instance, of the docket 
itself 
being 
withdrawn 
from 
the 
National 
Prosecuting 
Authority for whatever the reasons were and so on and 
there’s quite a bit of – few individuals involved there not on 
10 
the side of IPID but of course the National Prosecuting 
Authority and so it goes.  Now that is dealt with in detail in 
the report that I had to commission, in the work that I had 
to commission as the Werksmans investigation but I 
appreciate and understand the viewpoint by the Chair, it’s 
– you are right that, naturally you do come to this question 
but how is it possible that this thing can be done only at 
this level and not the entire value chain of sorts and so on 
but I think as and when we engage further with it, we’ll get 
more clarity, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: No, no that’s fine and of course, part of 
what one would look at is these are not just people who 
have no investigative experience, these are people who 
are – have got quite some experience of investigating and 
they would know exactly what to do if they wanted to do 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 157 of 201 
 
this but that doesn’t mean the alterations mustn’t be 
looked at, I’m just putting this, Mr Hulley.   
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair.  So, if I 
understand you correctly, what you’re saying is that, 
insofar as the additional investigations were conducted – 
that were conducted you would prefer Mr July to speak to 
that? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, Mr Hulley, I think let’s try and clarify 
this.  You are talking about additional investigation, now I 
need to be careful about that because there has been 
10 
reference to additional investigations but relating to the 
question of the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I think – Werksmans investigation. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Werksmans investigation. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So as far as the investigations 
conducted by Werksmans is concerned, you’d prefer Mr 
July to speak to that? 
MR NHLEKO:   Not necessarily, look, I prepared a 
statement and I came here, honourable Chair, in the first 
20 
day and you looked at me and – in a very intimidating kind 
of manner and said, you are not going to present this thing 
word for word right throughout, okay but it’s there, of 
course I’m exaggerating what I’ve just said, Chair, I’m 
sorry I’m saying it in jest.  Now …[intervenes]. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 158 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think what you’re saying about Mr 
July, you are simply saying, you are happy that – you are 
giving 
your 
own 
understanding 
of 
issues, 
your 
own 
perspective. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that the person that you asked to 
investigate will also come and give his own understanding 
and his perspective. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s what you are saying. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes, and particularly because he also had – 
he conducted the interviews, you know, face-to-face kind of 
interviews and interactions with people and he will be able 
to elucidate more points about what that experience 
entailed and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, and of course as we ask you 
questions, 
we 
will 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
you 
are 
not 
responsible for his decisions except insofar as you adopted  
but you are responsible for your own decisions and 
obviously if you adopt you might be asked but I think it’s 
20 
clear you are saying you are giving your perspective, he 
will come and give me his perspective as well, ja, Mr 
Hulley. 
ADV 
HULLEY 
SC: 
 
Thank 
you 
Mr 
Chair.  
Now…[intervenes]. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239

MR NHLEKO:  Could I – I’m sorry, Mr Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Washing of hands? 
MR NHLEKO:  Washing of hands yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to have a – I think I’ve 
got an idea that after close to two hours there should be a 
break to wash hands.  So, we are at quarter to four, maybe 
before – or maybe let’s have the washing of hands then 
when we come back, we can talk about the way forward.  
Ja we’ll adjourn for ten minutes is that fine?  We’ll adjourn 
for ten minutes. 
10 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the way forward.  I see Counsel for or 
he has just arrived.  Let us talk about the way forward.  We 
obviously have not finished.  Well let me start with the 
witness.  Mr Nhleko what is your situation?  I – I imagine but 
you must just tell me what your situation is.  I imagine that 
maybe we should look – you are still going to come back 
when Mr McBride is to be cross-examined.  One option would 
20 
be that we plan that when you come back you finish off your 
part and then Counsel cross-examines him.  Another option 
is that we proceed for another hour or so but I doubt that we 
will finish within an hour – that hour.  I am not sure if there 
is another option but what is your situation? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 160 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  Chair I initially had thought that we are going 
to finish yesterday but we then have now gravitated to where 
we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  But this is a matter of priority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And so as a result of which I think there 
would be something wrong if we do not finish tomorrow.  I am 
just making an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes, ja.  No, no. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:  There will be something fundamentally wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no we – if we go into tomorrow, we will 
finish tomorrow. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes so I am suggesting that in case you work 
around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I still am prepared to.. 
MR NHLEKO:  I am stuck around – I am stuck around this 
place that we do not like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
MR NHLEKO:  So we may… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you… 
MR NHLEKO:  I am looking at the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are looking at your Senior Counsel. 
MR NHLEKO:  At the SC here because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will be asking him just now what his 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 161 of 201 
 
position is 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes but that is my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But from your side even tomorrow you will 
[indistinct 00:02:36]  
MR NHLEKO:  Yes even tomorrow yes we can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we could go on for some time this 
afternoon and when we – if we still have not finished then 
continue tomorrow until we finish if we can with you.  I know 
there are other matters but I think that we should be able to 
finish with you even with those matters I think.  I think they 
10 
might have to be moved just like you have been moved in 
terms of – okay alright.  Mr Mokhari what is your situation? 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Chair I – I will be happy if we can 
proceed for an hour or two today and if tomorrow, we can 
finish before twelve then I will be able to push the 
commitments that I have for tomorrow to afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Mr Hulley, I know you are 
stuck with – with me.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if I am available you are available. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:  We conjoined unfortunately or fortunately 
as the case may be.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us go up to five and then we will 
see whether at five we go up to six or we stop at five and 
adjourn until tomorrow and then if we adjourn until tomorrow, 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 162 of 201 
 
we could start earlier than ten if that suits everybody. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Thank you.  Well let me 
ask this question as we move forward Mr Nhleko.  You know 
there has been this question of whether the so called first 
report was the final report or the second report or not ja.  
Now that question may be quite important for purposes of the 
concerns that you have raised.  Because if it was not a final 
report maybe it would follow from that that the IPID – that 
the final report could differ from a report that is not final and 
10 
therefore if there were differences between the two that 
should not raise any alarms.  Okay.  Now I think from your 
affidavit I think you have taken the view that it was a final 
report – the first report, is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes Sir that is very correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now one of the things that Mr 
Khuba said when he gave evidence in the commission was 
that the first report was not a final report.  And he said that 
is – that was so because – he said it was not a final report 
because there was still some investigation to be done when 
20 
it was submitted.  And as I recall he said although the cell 
phone records were there, they had not yet been analysed 
by I assume an expert.  And he said the differences between 
the first report and the final report I do not know whether all 
of them or some of them were based on the analysis of the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 163 of 201 
 
cell phone records that had taken place.  Now I am aware 
that there is a memorandum which Mr Mosing – Advocate 
Mosing from the NPA wrote to Mr Chauke of the NPA and to 
Ms Jiba or the NPA in which he also confirmed that the 
analysis of the cell phone records was outstanding.  Are you 
aware of the same thing as well? 
MR NHLEKO:  No I am aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  From the investigation report conducted by 
Werksmans that there is that aspect.  In fact, I also 
10 
accommodated it onto my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Which is more of an issue dealing with the 
process and the handling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Of this particular matter between IPID and the 
NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And could I just allude to two things – sorry 
because the Chair spoke to the question of what Mr Khuba 
20 
said that this is the final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but before you do that I just wanted to 
check before I proceed that you are aware of this – we are 
on the same page.  You are aware that Mr Mosing also said 
in some memorandum that the analysis of cell phone records 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 164 of 201 
 
was outstanding at the time the first report was submitted to 
them.  You are aware of that? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes I am aware I saw it in the investigation 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are aware okay alright.  Okay.  Now 
my question on this debate of whether the first report was 
final or not is therefore how could it be – how could it have 
been regarded as final if the work – the investigative work 
had not been completed yet? 
MR NHLEKO:  How I would respond to that maybe in two or 
10 
three different sort of ways.  The first one Chair is that I 
think investigators who also did this work will shed more 
light on that question when they coming to testify.  That I 
think 
just 
the 
few 
extracts 
that 
I 
made 
before 
this 
commission. The one thing that you can clearly see is that 
there is no additional information in the second report.  
Rather something has been taken away from the first report.  
So I think for me that is very glaring.  You know you have 
deleted paragraphs, deleted statements and so on in the 
construction of the second one and so on.  So it is a – I am 
20 
aware 
that 
somewhere 
in 
the 
– 
in 
the 
investigation 
conducted by Werksmans that issue also was a letter around 
the question of you know in fact there are two things.  The 
question of the cell phone records and warning statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The warning statements ja. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 165 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:  You know those are the things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I leave 
out the 
warning 
statements 
because I take it they – the people concerned could not be 
forced to make them. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the cell phone records stands on a 
different footing. 
MR NHLEKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my question is how could anybody 
regard the first report as final when the investigation had not 
10 
been completed because there was still an analysis of the 
cell phone records that was to be done? 
MR NHLEKO:  Oh okay.  Now I do not want to claim any 
particular knowledge around specifically that area.  Save to 
say 
you 
know 
Chair 
that 
when 
that 
was 
done 
my 
understanding is that you had two reports before the report 
of the January 22.  You have a draft produced in October and 
a draft produced in November 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NHLEKO:  Now a – I think the former acting Executive 
20 
Director Ms Koekie Mbeki would also shed some light around 
the question of that report of the 22n d because she by then 
was the Accounting Officer.  That is about almost three 
months before Mr McBride came in they emerged and so on.  
She would also shed light around the question of the finality 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 166 of 201 
 
of that report and what the arrangements were between IPID 
and the NPA for an example.  My understanding from what I 
hear is that she also was quite involved with that work of the 
investigation done by Mr Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would you agree that the report on the 
basis of which together with the statements you as Minister 
would be expected to make a decision and the NPA would be 
expected to make its own decisions about criminal matters 
would be the final report and not a report that was not final. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes it would be the final report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would agree? 
MR NHLEKO:  I agree with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore to the extent that the first 
report may not have been a final report you would not be 
expected to make your decision based on it.  Now when I 
talk about your decision, I am talking about disciplinary 
matters whether somebody must be charged or suspended 
and so on.  I am not suggesting that if you pick up that there 
was something that needed to be investigated you could not 
say let it be investigated but I am just saying you would 
20 
accept that you would be expected to make your decisions 
on the basis of a final report whichever it is? 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it must be a final report. 
MR NHLEKO:  No that is correct. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 167 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  I think that is a correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:  Articulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay alright. 
MR NHLEKO:  My contention only with regards to the first 
report which I refer to as a final report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Is that if the report was not final what was it 
doing at the NPA? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
MR NHLEKO:  That is not for the Chair to answer it is a 
rhetorical question I am just saying.  So what was it?  Why 
would a draft report be in the hands of the National 
Prosecuting Authority for them to decide to prosecute or not 
to prosecute? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  If it is a draft.  If it was a draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give me the other – there is the other 
lever arch file that I cannot remember what it is called that 
20 
Mr Hulley you… 
ADV HULLEY SC:  In relation to which Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it has got my notes.  Have you seen 
that one?  I just want to us to speak with specifics.  At the 
beginning it has got some notes that I made – handwritten 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 168 of 201 
 
notes at the beginning.  The files that were brought up 
yesterday.  Ja right at the beginning it has got my 
handwritten notes.  While he is looking for the file that has 
got my notes let me say this – let me say two things to you 
Mr Nhleko in regard to your rhetorical question. 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Khuba gave evidence here and said he 
was placed under tremendous pressure to submit his report 
to the NPA.  I think one of the people that he said placed 
considerable pressure on him was General Ntlemeza if I am 
10 
not mistaken.  I think he said something like you are 
delaying – you are delaying my move to the Hawks or 
something like that.  You know when are you finishing the 
investigation.  I am paraphrasing. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  But I think he also said Mr 
Mosing also put a lot of pressure on him and he even said 
normally a report like that must be signed by the Executive 
Director of IPID but this was submitted with his signature 
only.  He might have said the acting Executive Director was 
20 
not available or something I am not sure but definitely he 
said there was a lot of pressure put on him to complete his 
investigation and submit his report.  That is one.  But two I 
definitely have made a note I saw a memorandum by Mr 
Mosing addressed to Mr Jiba – Ms Jiba I am sorry – Mr Jiba 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 169 of 201 
 
and Mr Chauke within the NPA in which he definitely there 
are still outstanding – there is still something outstanding 
and that is the analysis of the cell phone records but 
definitely he said there was a lot of pressure put on him to 
complete his investigation and submit his report.  That is 
one.   
 
But two, I definitely have made a note.  I saw a memo by 
Mr Moseng addressed to Mr Jiba... Ms Jiba.  I am sorry.  Ms 
Jiba and Mr Chauke within the LPA in which he definitely 
said there are still outstanding... there is still something 
10 
outstanding and that is the analyses of the cell phone 
records. 
 
He may have actually said this is not final.  I am not 
sure.  I may be mistaken about that part but I am not 
mistaken about the part where he said the analyses of the 
cell phone records is outstanding. 
 
So now, if I am correct factually that that is what Mr 
Moseng said, I want to suggest to you that that must mean 
that the final... or rather, the first report was not a product of 
a complete investigation or a completed investigation. 
20 
 
And if that was so, my logic suggest that it could not be 
a final report.  Have you got something to say to this 
thinking? 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I think that is arguable point Honourable 
Chair.  You know, for starters, I would not be privy to 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 170 of 201 
 
discussions between certain individuals.  I know that the... 
the claim or allegation has been made which is... which I 
think it makes me very big, you know, that I must also have 
captured the National Prosecuting Authority and so on. 
 
Now it is quite significant but I will deal with that point a 
day... at another point... at a later point your Honourable 
Chair. 
 
But I am saying, I would not be privy, for instance, to 
discussions either pertaining to Mr Moseng, Moeletsi and 
Chauke and whomever, except what I see in the reports that 
10 
indeed there were such things. 
 
I would also not be privy to the pressure points that Mr 
Khuba must have been subjected to by... whether it is 
...[indistinct] or any other individual and so on.  I would not 
know about those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  Now.. and I still do think that if Ms Mbeki was 
to be called, I think she would shed more light about this 
issue of...  
 
So if the January 22 report was not final, so how come it 
20 
followed a legislative, a sort of route, to the NPA for the NPA 
to make a decision? 
 
So if the report was not final, what was... perhaps also 
the logical and relevant question related to that would be, 
what was the rush?  If I may put it that way? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 171 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR 
NHLEKO: 
 
So 
what 
would 
have 
been 
the 
rush 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  If that report was not complete?  And then 
you take it to the National Prosecuting Authority and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  And perhaps, that is when the statements 
allegedly made by Mr Khuba, perhaps will also assist in 
determining the question of the finality of this particular 
10 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  But as things stand, my position is simple.  
That was the final report and that is why it was with the NPA 
for prosecution.  Now and that is why, even amongst other 
things, the NPA itself, besides the memo from Moseng to 
Chauke or Ms Jiba and so, the matter was also even 
escalated to the level of the National Director of Public 
Prosecution then.  So how could it get that far when we 
have... if this is a draft report?  And so.  So, I think those 
20 
are relevant questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I think you are right.  Those 
questions are relevant.  I am going to read to you something 
in my own notes in regard to what Ms Moseng said in the 
memo that I am talking about.  I cannot locate the memo 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 172 of 201 
 
itself but once I have read, maybe counsel will be able to 
locate it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  [No audible response] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying, once I have read the relevant 
part, the quotations in my handwritten notes, maybe counsel 
will be able to tell us where it is...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...in the bundle but we might not need to 
go there for present purposes.  But I want to say, I am not 
sure what the position is with Ms Mbeki. 
10 
 
But you are maybe aware that when the IPID witnesses 
gave evidence here... or rather, when Mr Khuba gave 
evidence here or even from his statements, he said that Ms 
Mbeki told him not to involve Mr Sesoko in this investigation 
which he found strange because Mr Sesoko was his 
supervisor.   
 
The only person that he was reporting to for all 
investigations.  He did not understand why, in regard to this 
particular one, he should not involve Mr Sesoko.  That is one 
of the things that Mr Khuba said.   
20 
 
Two, both Mr Khuba... I think Mr Khuba and Mr McBride 
but certainly Mr Khuba, I think, he raised the question of 
how... he raised the question of the involvement of Crime 
Intelligence in this investigation. 
 
And now I maybe mixing up Khuba and McBride but one 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 173 of 201 
 
or more of them said Crime Intelligence does not get 
involved in investigations.  That is not their job.  Their job is 
different. 
 
But in this case, they had begun this investigation and it 
was then handed over to us and that was changed.  That is 
what I was told. 
 
And then of course, you have, according to Mr Khuba 
and Ms Mbeki saying, although you are going to investigate 
this, do not involve Mr Sesoko, you know.   
 
So there are those things.  But this is what I wrote here 
10 
about it.  The memorandum I am talking about ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja? 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Can I be of some assistance? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes?  It is stated 13 February 2014.   
ADV HULLEY SC:  Wait. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it?  Okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is part of the Y7 Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, just say where it is on the record. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I will read from my note just for the 
record ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  It is on page 112 Y7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  This is what I wrote here.  
The memo was also addressed to Mr H Chauke, the DPP for 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 174 of 201 
 
Southern Gauteng.  The purpose of that memo is said to be: 
“To provide a summary of the facts and evidence in 
the matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, 
South Gauteng to be able to make an informed 
decision regarding the prosecution of the matter...” 
 
That is said to be the purpose of the memo by Mr 
Moseng.  And then, I made a note here that says: 
“The part of Mr Khuba’s version that says that the 
investigation 
had 
not 
been 
completed 
and 
that 
therefore the January 2014 was not a final report, 
10 
seems 
to 
be 
corroborated 
by 
Mr 
Moseng’s 
memorandum of 13 February 2014.   
In part of 6.3 of his memo, Mr Moseng said in part 
when talking about his view, that Major General 
Sibiya did not appear to have been involved...” 
 
He said: 
“The 
cell 
phone 
evidence, 
however, 
does 
not 
corroborate his presence during the operations.  This 
can be looked at again more closely after an expert 
has been procured to analyse the cell phone data.  
20 
This could not be done by the time of writing this 
report despite it being pointed out to the investigating 
team...” 
MR NHLEKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just thought I would mention that that 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 175 of 201 
 
is what caught my attention as I was looking but I am not 
sure if there is anything that you want to add on the issue or 
to clarify, as the report is final... was final or not.  I think you 
have said what you wanted to say. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, I think largely that is what I have been... 
but I also definitely it will be to the benefit of this 
Commission if Ms Mbeki was to be located and report. 
 
Now 
for 
instance, 
in 
the 
investigation 
report 
by 
Werksmans, they provide an explanation because they have 
also engaged with Ms Kuki as to this question why Mr 
10 
Sesoko was not to be involved with Mr Khuba in the... to the 
construction of that first report. 
 
I think Ms Mbeki and I am not going to verbatim but I am 
also just para-phrasing in a sense.  It was concerned about 
the fact that Mr Sesoko had a criminal record which he was 
still in the process of expunging from the system. 
 
And that with his involvement, she thought it was going 
to be challenged by the implicated persons, for instance, on 
the grounds of that criminal record and so on.  Something to 
that effect. 
20 
 
Look, as to what that means, really, I think it can then be 
further explored with her ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:  ...as and when she deposes some information 
with this Commission.   
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 176 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  I know that 
at some stage last year, I asked whether attempts have been 
made to make contact with Ms Mbeki.  I seem to understand 
that at some stage, I was told she also tried to make contact 
with the Commission but I am not sure ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:  Her affidavit was recently ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...where that process is. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Apparently, she... we have got the draft 
that she has prepared but it has yet to be deposed by her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Alright.  But just going back 
then to from your side.  You have said that you regarded the 
first report as final from your point of view. 
MR NHLEKO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think you did indeed also say but you 
were not aware that there was something still to be done at 
that time.  I think you said you were not aware.  Is that right?  
About the cell phone record analyses. 
MR NHLEKO:  Okay, let me try and put it in context stage 
here.  When the matter arose of the illegal renditions of the 
20 
Zimbabweans, there are series of events leading up to the 
points of investigations.   
 
The first point is that the Civilian Secretariat of Police, 
they did some work.  They... which was not necessarily 
investigated but basically and analyses and overview of what 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 177 of 201 
 
were the issues. 
 
And 
if 
I 
am 
not 
mistaken, 
that 
report 
made 
recommendations to the then Minister of Police who was not 
me.  And then the recommendation, the local stat dealing in 
that report dealing with recommendations, they raised two 
things. 
 
That they recommended that either the Minister of Police 
then was to engage with the Minister of Justice and 
Constitutional Development and agree on an appointment of 
a judge or a senior judge or a retired judge, I think. 
10 
 
But there was also reference to the DPCI judge here I 
think.  It must have been Judge Pillay at that time, that he 
could also be utilised for investigative work around the 
question 
of 
the 
allegations 
of 
the 
renditions 
of 
the 
Zimbabweans. 
 
And the second recommendation, if I am not mistaken, 
said the investigation could also be... because I think DPCI 
also did some investigation at some point.   
 
They were investigating themselves effectively in a 
sense.  That that investigation needed to be taken away from 
20 
the police service because they were also implicated, I think. 
 
That is my assumption.  And then gave it to IPID, alright, 
which I think was the correct position.  So it does appear 
that the then minister before I came in took that position for 
this investigative work to be done by IPID. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 178 of 201 
 
 
And that is when Mr Khuba then gets assigned to 
actually conduct this investigation.  I think there was... 
correctly so.  I think there was also the involvement.  I think 
somebody cited the fact that the Crime Intelligence was also 
somewhat involved to some extent and then pulled out at a 
later point. 
 
So you had all those kind of processes.  The third area 
was the Criminal Justice itself.  I have also dealt with this 
particular issue of the renditions of the Zimbabweans.  They 
even issued a statement to that effect and called upon an 
10 
investigation to be conducted on this issue. 
 
And I think Advocate Moseng in the... in his interactions 
with Werksmans, the investigators eluded to the mere fact 
that 
the 
then 
Minister 
of 
Justice 
and 
Constitutional 
Development also addressed senior management at the 
National Prosecuting Authority about the question of the 
illegal renditions of the Zimbabweans and that something 
needed to be done. 
 
So I am saying there were series of these particular 
matters long before Mr McBride came in and long before I 
20 
also came in, okay.  So, you know, correctly so, anybody 
who comes in may tell me that I found these particular 
matters in process and I found them midstream and so 
forth and that was basically it.  So I am just clarifying this 
area because it is also important to refer to context in a 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 179 of 201 
 
sense, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is alright. But would you 
agree with this proposition that if the first report was not 
based on a completed investigation, IPID was maybe not 
just entitled but obliged to give you a report that is based 
on a completed investigation.   
MR NHLEKO:   I am trying to hear you, honourable Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure what you were saying but 
let me repeat what I am saying. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, no, I am just saying I am trying to hear 
10 
you in terms of the point that they are making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is a question. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you agree with the proposition 
that says if the first report, namely that of the 22 January, 
was based – was not based on a completed investigation, 
IPID was entitled, maybe was obliged, actually, to give you 
a report that was based on a completed investigation.   
20 
MR NHLEKO:   In other words, it would have been a 
complete investigation, you would not have a report that is 
sitting somewhere, you know, incomplete, and then have 
another one which is said to be complete to this end and 
so on, so my view would be that if a report is not complete 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 180 of 201 
 
– a report is not complete, so all you do, you continue 
further work to complete the report before you submit it to 
your principal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  I think that suggests that 
you would agree with that proposition. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, okay.  Thank you.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Chair …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   Can I also …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, yes. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Because I think it is a matter that also 
arises, honourable Chair from some of the issues that you 
said, there is this assertion that investigator ’s reports are 
to be signed by an Executive Director of IPID.  Now there 
is no law that say that, there is no regulation that says 
that.  In fact, there are other major reports that were – 
major investigation reports, I am sorry, whereby, - I needed 
to qualify that, that were conducted by IPID.  So I will cite 
largely to – there was a Mr Angus, for an example, who 
conducted investigation around the issue of Cato Manor in 
20 
Durban, the killings that were taking place there and 
implicating the conduct of the police and so on.  Now there 
was no executive director that signed there, it was the 
chief investigator who signed and referred the report to the 
National Prosecuting Authority.  Similarly, also with regards 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 181 of 201 
 
to Marikana, I am told that Mr Gamanjane, one of the 
implicated persons who must also appear here as a state 
capture to – he was commissioned to do work there.  Now 
that report was also not signed by an Executive Director 
but it was signed off by a Chief Investigator and referred to 
the National Prosecuting Authority, so it is not a matter 
that 
would 
also 
be 
performed 
any 
way 
in 
law 
or 
regulations, for example, or IPID Act.   
In the work that Werksmans did they also interacted 
– specifically interrogated this question and Ms Mbeki, Ms 
10 
Kuki Mbeki clarified this issue that it is not so.  So but I am 
raising this because the impression has been made that if 
a report by IPID is valid, it has got to be sanctioned inside 
of – by the Executive Director, that is not correct.  So, I am 
raising it because the Chair said something about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine.  Mr Hulley. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  The particular 
issue is dealt with extensively in the affidavits of Mr 
Sandile July.  I would prefer to deal with it in the context of 
his testimony, understand that the witness …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which issue – is that the question of 
who signs or the earlier question that …[intervenes] 
ADV HULLEY SC:   The question of who signs the – or 
whether the report has to be signed by the Executive 
Director. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 182 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That also depends on at what level the 
report is being – or the investigation is being conducted, 
whether 
it 
is 
a 
national 
investigation, 
provincial 
investigation, it is dependent upon the regulations that are 
applicable.  Unfortunately, the regulations are not in the 
current bundle that we have handed up to you, it was a 
matter that was to be dealt with with Mr July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, to the extent that this witness has 
taken a position on that point, if as an evidence leader you 
10 
do not believe he is correct, at some stage before he 
leaves the witness stand you need to come back to him and  
deal with that, ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   We certainly will deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, otherwise he will have good 
enough reason to think you have not issue with his 
position. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, if I understand it, Mr Nhleko, 
would it be fair to say insofar as that is concerned you say 
there is no law that makes provision for that, are you 
20 
referring to the [indistinct] 40.47 perhaps, what are you 
referring to?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I should say the witness 
just came up with this issue when you may have been on a 
certain path.  You can shelve his issue …[intervenes] 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 183 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And deal with it at the right time.  As 
long as before at some stage tomorrow before he leaves… 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Indeed, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have raised it with him if you have 
an issue with it. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But otherwise you can stick to the path 
that you were on just before he raised that issue. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   After the investigation had been 
10 
completed by the Werksmans’ team they submitted a report 
to you.  The report was dated the 24 April. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, yes, correct, sir.  
ADV HULLEY SC:   And – but between the time that their 
terms of reference were given to them and the time of the 
completion of the report, which was the 24 April, there 
would have been some interaction between you and 
Werksmans, would that be correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   Now what kind of interaction exactly?  Do 
you 
mean 
between 
the 
time 
when 
they 
started 
the 
20 
investigation and the time when they did what?  Completed 
it? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Between the terms of reference, if my 
memory serves me correct, was the 25 February of 2015. 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 184 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the report was completed on the 4 
April – sorry, the 24 April of 2015.  What I am asking you is 
whether there was interaction in between that time. 
MR NHLEKO:   I am not sure whether between that time 
but there was ongoing interaction, that is how I will put it.  
I would not necessarily pin it down to a specific period. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Sure. 
MR NHLEKO:   There was an ongoing interaction. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And the interaction that took place 
would have been – would have, amongst others -were there 
10 
any reports that were being – interim reports that were 
being provided to you? 
MR NHLEKO:   I cannot recall whether there were interim 
reports except that one of the issues I recall was when Mr 
July raised what he thought was the lack of cooperation for 
instance on the side of Mr Khuba to which my reaction was 
basically, you know, calling Mr Khuba and said look, these 
investigators, I had appointed them, please cooperate with 
the investigation and that was it.  But it is possible that 
there could have been other briefs even if - you know, 
20 
when I refer to briefs, I need to qualify this because briefs 
by lawyers is something else, you know, but briefs in the 
context of public roles as we played them, it could be a 
brief as an when somebody walks in and they would brief 
this is where we are with the investigation or whatever or 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 185 of 201 
 
any other process related thereto.  So it is possible. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So you got a report back.  At least one 
of the report backs to you was that Mr Khuba or the IPID 
investigators were not cooperating.  You then contacted Mr 
Khuba. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, no, let me correct you, Mr Hulley.  I did 
not say IPID investigators, I spoke about Mr Khuba. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now there is a litany of investigators of 
IPID who are commissioned on a weekly basis so I would 
10 
not say that they were not cooperating because the issue 
in this instance was pertaining to the investigation report 
produced by Mr Khuba. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Very well. 
MR NHLEKO:   So I wanted to correct that, sir. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So, if I understand correctly, the report 
back to you was specifically that Mr Khuba is not 
cooperating. 
MR NHLEKO:   I have responded, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I did not hear the question. 
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   What I had asked the witness earlier 
on, I was trying to understand what the report back from 
Werksmans was, so my earlier question was, was the 
report back that Mr Khuba or the IPID investigators were 
not cooperating, understand from the response that was 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 186 of 201 
 
given was that he was speaking specifically about Khuba.  
I just want to make it clear or I just want to understand, 
was the report back from Werksmans that Mr Khuba 
specifically was not cooperating? 
MR NHLEKO:   I responded to that question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just respond again so that there is 
no doubt. 
MR NHLEKO:   They responded that Mr July reported to me 
that Mr Khuba seemed not to have been cooperative with 
the investigation. 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Was there any report in relation to the 
other two, that is Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I do not remember anything except that 
– of course, at a later point I was being briefed.  Whether 
at the conclusion of their report or towards the conclusion I 
also cannot recall but people that had been interviewed 
and spoken to, they also included Mr McBride and a 
statement was taken in that regard.  I was there something 
simply to that effect. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Now initially you got your PA to 
20 
telephone Mr Khuba, would that be correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   No, that is incorrect. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So your PA did not phone Mr Khuba? 
MR NHLEKO:   I do not know whether she did. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well, if she did - and Mr Khuba 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 187 of 201 
 
testified that she had phone him on several occasions – if 
she did phone him, on whose instructions would she be 
acting? 
MR NHLEKO:   I also would not know really on whose 
instructions it would be. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   In fact she – sorry. 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, even in the affidavit deposed by Mr 
Khuba he does not say that he was called several times, so 
I think there is a little bit of an exaggeration there, I mean, 
just… 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Just bear with me?  But the point is 
and I will get to the reference shortly, the point is that if 
she did phone him, she would not have been acting on your 
instructions according to you. 
MR NHLEKO:   Look, I would not know what people in my 
office and, you know, what they do and who do they phone 
and say what to other people and so on.  I mean, there is 
no way I would know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you may or may not remember 
whether if she did phone you had asked her to phone.  I 
20 
think the question is whether if she phoned she would have 
phoned because you asked her to or you might say I 
cannot remember whether I had asked her to and it could 
be that she phoned without me asking her to – so what is 
your recollection around that? 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 188 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I mean, why would I phone Mr Khuba?  
What for? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   I mean, that is the point.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the short answer …[intervenes] 
MR NHLEKO:   The only call I remember… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR NHLEKO:   Is the one pertaining to a matter that was 
brought to my attention by Mr July the investigating person 
for Werksmans. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And that is basically… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   Now – so I see that, you know, claims have 
been made that I called him and I wanted him to come 
down to Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   I mean, Cape Town is the other end of the 
world from Limpopo, you know, it is not – so why would I 
want to do that?  Really.  This person, by the way, has got 
20 
nothing to do with me because it is not a person that I 
supervised directly, okay?  It would be something else, for 
instance, if – and I would understand  - that let us take a 
person like Mr McBride in his …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the Executive Director. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 189 of 201 
 
MR NHLEKO:   In his position as the Executive Director of 
IPID that indeed it is possible that I would summon him to 
meetings 
wherever, 
and 
so 
on 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
an 
investigator, really… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is – I have not refreshed my memory on 
this, is what you are saying that you would not have 
contacted Mr Khuba at all because if you wanted something 
relating to IPID you would talk to the Executive Director or 
is the position that there is an occasion that you say you 
did call him but not another occasion? 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   No, not at any other occasion, in fact 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But the ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:   ...in fact I do not know why Honourable 
Chair this thing is made an issue because precisely it is 
hearsay, I mean somebody says my PA called him, and 
Khuba does not say that I called him, then that is the 
difference, it would be something else if we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s talk about you and Mr Khuba 
because I seem to remember that Mr Khuba testified that 
20 
you called him, that is what I am trying to clarify. 
MR NHLEKO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether you are saying yes I did call 
him maybe once, for a specific reason but if he says or if 
somebody says I called him on another occasion that is 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 190 of 201 
 
what I am denying, or whether your position is I never 
called Mr Khuba for anything. 
MR NHLEKO:   No I already clarified on the issue of calling 
Mr Khuba, that I indeed did, once. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, only once. 
MR NHLEKO:   Only once and in fact in his affidavit that is 
what he says. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this is what he talks about. 
MR NHLEKO:   He says no it was just a call, a very brief 
call from me and it was once. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   And then he refers then to this other person 
that he calls – he says it was my PA who called him 
because he does not even cite that person in the affidavit 
as to who it was except to say that that was my PA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR NHLEKO:   Who called him and said whatever. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Mr Chair the relevance – sorry the 
passages in Exhibit Y4 it is the affidavit of Mr Khuba and it 
appears at page 25. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it say anything other than what Mr 
Nhleko says namely Mr Khuba talks about Mr Nhleko 
calling him once, he doesn’t talk about ...[intervenes]  
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is true, he records Mr Nhleko 
personally calls him once. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 191 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   And as far as the PA is concerned it is 
several calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, and it is Mr Khuba who says 
Mr Nhleko’s PA called him several times. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   So he says the following, it is page 25 
of that exhibit at paragraph 81, he says: 
“Shortly before Mr McBride’s suspension in March 
of 2015 I received a number of calls from the then 
Minister of Police, Minister Nati Nhleko’s personal 
10 
assistant who did not disclose her name, save to 
say that she was his personal assistant.  She 
informed me that Minister Nhleko wanted to see me.  
I informed her that I required the permission from 
the Executive Director of IPID, Mr McBride, before I 
could do so she phoned again and told me that 
Minister Nhleko wanted me to fly to Cape Town over 
the weekend and that he would cover the costs.  I 
told her that it would make no difference whether 
the meeting took place during office hours or over 
20 
the weekend, because as long as the meeting 
related to IPID business the Executive Director had 
to know about it.  On the following day Minister 
Nhleko phoned me and told me to cooperate with 
Werksmans Attorneys regarding the January and 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 192 of 201 
 
March 2014 reports. 
Now there were several calls from her according to Mr 
Khuba, if we are to understand correctly you say that you 
don’t know what your – the staff within your office are 
doing, but what is clear is on your version and on Mr 
Khuba’s version you did phone him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said he phoned him once. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes you did phone him, but you phoned 
him once, that is clear, there is no doubt about that, that 
you are conceding to. 
10 
MR NHLEKO:   Both myself and Mr Khuba we talk about 
the same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   Once, that’s what happened.  Now Chair I 
do not know why we are ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Nhleko, I think let’s allow Mr 
Hulley to continue, exactly what your concern is might be 
addressed in the next question. 
MR NHLEKO:    No I am sure Chair that it is not because 
he has already made this point. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ja. 
MR NHLEKO:   The point he has made which is also made 
in Khuba’s affidavit, is that essentially this Commission is 
talking about a faceless person.  Khuba’s affidavit says 
she did not disclose her name.  So Mr Hulley why do you 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 193 of 201 
 
call her my PA, when my PA had a name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the affidavit of Mr Khuba, the 
passage that Mr Hulley read said the Minister ’s PA. 
MR NHLEKO:   Yes, but  he says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s why he is saying your PA. 
MR NHLEKO:  No, no, no in the affidavit Mr Khuba himself 
he then says she did not disclose her name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   So the question arises maybe to both Mr 
Hulley and Mr Khuba, so the PA I had, had a name and a 
10 
surname, so this Commission where is it going to talk 
about faceless people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No Mr Nhleko ...[intervenes]  
MR 
NHLEKO: 
 
 
Because 
the 
point 
is 
this 
Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Nhleko, no, no, no. 
MR NHLEKO:    Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These are some of the things that make 
us take long.  Mr Khuba according to the passage that Mr 
Hulley read ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR NHLEKO:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Said that the person who called her said 
she was or he was, I can’t remember whether it was a he 
or a she. 
MR NHLEKO:   No she. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 194 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was the Minister ’s PA, but did not 
disclose her name, right.  So you have confirmed to Mr 
Hulley that you did call Mr Khuba once and you have said 
that Mr Khuba also talks about one occasion when you 
called him.  He then talks about these other calls from the 
person that he understood or was told was your PA, I think 
Mr Hulley must then come up with the next question and 
then you answer that, let’s make progress, let’s hear what 
the question is. 
MR NHLEKO:   No, I accept that Chair, thanks. 
10 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Chair maybe before he continues, 
before he answers, I don’t know if Mr Hulley wants to really 
take this issue of a call that Khuba says was made by 
somebody else to him because if he wants to take it further 
he should also give the witness the benefit of what Khuba is 
said to have told McBride about the same issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Because we have that very same issue 
in McBride’s statement at paragraph 30 where McBride says 
that Khuba told him something different in respect of the 
20 
same thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Maybe for his benefit I can just read it 
out then he can decide whether to what extent he wants to 
take it further. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 195 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is why I was saying Mr Nhleko 
must wait for the next question because depending on what 
that question is it might include what you are talking about. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we are at two minutes to five. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure whether it is convenient to 
wrap it up because I think we must stop at five, wrap it up at 
this stage or do you want to put your next question and then 
once we’ve got the answer we adjourn? 
10 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Well I think let me, because it seems 
that something, a little bit more might come out of this but 
what I want to deal with just to allay or to deal with one 
concern that has been raised by Mr Nhleko, relating to this 
so-called nameless – sorry faceless person.  That is not 
what Mr Khuba is saying, he is not identifying her as a 
faceless person, he is saying a specific person.  If I tell you 
that I spoke to a person who identified herself as your wife, 
now unless you have got several thousand wives, then it 
becomes difficult of course, but if you have only got one wife 
20 
it is easy to know who that person is, you got back to her 
and you speak to her, she will then tell you actually that is 
not true, but you can then say to us as far as your affidavit 
or your response is concerned I know the person that he is 
referring to, the person is Ms – and tell us who that person 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 196 of 201 
 
is, and say I have not been able to get hold of her because 
for the last three or four years I have not been in the 
Ministry, I don’t know what has become of her, or something 
to that effect.  You are telling us that this is a faceless 
person, you know the face of your PA, presumably you had a 
PA, is that correct? 
 
Is that correct? 
MR NHLEKO:   I have already attested to that Mr Hulley 
but look the example you just made is the most simply stick 
kind of an example and does not apply in institutions of 
10 
governance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
MR NHLEKO:   In formal institutions if I pick up a call and I 
am calling Mr Hulley, right, I would say Mr Hulley, is that 
Mr Hulley and Mr Hulley says yes it is me, I say Mr Hulley 
you are speaking to Nkosinathi Phiwayinkosi Thamsanqa 
Nhleko, right, whatever my function is and so forth, I am 
calling you let’s say now PA, I am calling you on behalf of 
a Mr Mokhari, okay I am working for Mr Mokhari instructs 
me that you are this that and that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Nhleko as I understand your position 
you did not instruct your secretary or your PA to call Mr 
Khuba. 
MR NHLEKO:   Why are you bothering to go into that 
because once you say I did not instruct her, and if she said 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 197 of 201 
 
to Mr Khuba that if she phoned Mr Khuba in the first place 
several times and said that she was – if that was my PA 
phoning she was doing so without my knowledge, that 
should be all you should be really interested in, then we 
can move on. 
MR NHLEKO:   No I accept that Chair, but low-angling is 
quite different from how Mr Hulley wants to take up this 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NHLEKO:   And that is why I have a problem, and the 
10 
problem is  nothing to do with you Chair but a problem in 
terms of the manner in which he is angling into this thing, 
you know it is as if a indeed I must have instructed my PA 
to do this and so on, and I am saying no, that cannot be 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, Mr Nhleko has said if his PA did 
phone Mr Khuba it was not because he had asked her to do 
so, but he knows that he phoned him once, Mr Khuba 
accepts that he phoned him once.  Maybe this is the right 
time to adjourn or ...  
20 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is not a question that you wanted 
to ...[intervenes]  
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 198 of 201 
 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well I do want to ask further questions 
related to the very issue around the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we wrap up? 
ADV HULLEY SC:   But if you don’t mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can say another two, three, five 
minutes that’s fine. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we stop. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:    Chair would you like me to read that 
paragraph, I think it will resolve the whole thing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay read it Mr Mokhari. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Well this day in McBride’s affidavit 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, don’t speak far from your mic. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:    On my thing it is written as RJL006. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t be far from your mic. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   So on the same issue Mr McBride 
writes as follows, paragraph 30 he says: 
20 
“Khuba reported having received multiple calls from 
Nhleko’s personal assistant asking him to meet with 
Nhleko for a face to face meeting.” 
Then he proceeds and he says: 
“Nhleko himself called Khuba promising him that the 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 199 of 201 
 
Minister will cover his travelling costs to Cape Town 
on the weekend so that I would not find out about 
it.” 
So Khuba has told this Commission in an affidavit and 
McBride two different things.  So that is your result. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, mmm, okay. 
ADV HULLEY SC:  Well with respect I am not sure that 
that does resolve it at all, because obviously two witnesses 
may have a different recollection of things.  I do not want 
to debate that issue with the witness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is a matter that Mr Mokhari of 
course will be at liberty to raise and to argue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe what we should do, maybe 
we should adjourn, you also get a chance to look at the 
whole thing so when we come back tomorrow you might 
wrap it up in a certain way. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think let us stop.  Tomorrow we 
should start earlier, earlier than ten if we can.   I think we 
20 
should start at half past nine, will that be fine with 
everybody? 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   That will be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That will be fine with you Mr Nhleko? 
MR NHLEKO:   It is good. 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 200 of 201 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am going to put a deadline for us to 
finish with Mr Nhleko tomorrow. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We must aim to finish with him within 
two hours. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   That is perfectly in order, of course it 
is subject ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will start at half past nine, I am 
saying we must finish with him within two hours, that 
excludes 
re-examination, 
so 
I 
am 
not 
including 
re-
10 
examination on that but from the point of view of the 
evidence leader and myself. 
ADV MOKHARI SC:   Chair I am very happy with that 
timeline because I don’t anticipate re-examination to be 
more than 30 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Okay, no thank you.  So 
tomorrow, so Mr Hulley you look at what is really important 
and we deal with that tomorrow within two hours I want us 
to finish with him, so that we can move on to other matters. 
ADV HULLEY SC:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you to you Mr Nhleko and to Mr 
Mokhari for all your cooperation, so that we can try and 
wrap this up tomorrow.  Thank you very much. 
MR NHLEKO:   Thank you very much sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we will adjourn and then tomorrow we 
28 JULY 2020 – DAY 239 
 
Page 201 of 201 
 
will start at half past nine. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
