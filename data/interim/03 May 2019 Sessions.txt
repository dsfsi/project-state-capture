HEARING RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we start I just have two matters that I want to 
deal with.  The one is what I said yesterday with regard to Colonel 
Madhoe.  Sections of the media may have misunderstood what I said or 
I may not have articulated what I wanted to say correctly.  So I just 
want to try again to make sure that I am not misunderstood.   
1.  I am hearing evidence in relation to Law Enforcement Agencies 
10 
in regard to which there is a suggestion that powers were being 
abused n regard to the arrest and prosecution of officers wh o 
were investigating corruption matters and that they were being 
suspended and there were transfers that appear not to have been 
motivated by proper reasons but may have been connected with 
corruption or harassing people who were doing their job.  And in 
regard to Colonel Madhoe I have heard evidence that suggests 
that he may be guilty of corruption.  That he may have been 
guilty of bribery or attempted bribery.  And I have heard that it 
appears that not much has been done over many years in regard 
20 
to the allegations against him relating to bribery.  And that 
includes in terms of internal disciplinary matters within SAPS.  
So if not much has been done over so many years that would be 
a matter of grave concern but I am not at this stage or I am not 
the person at this stage to say whether he should or should not 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 3 of 170 
 
be there at work.  Somebody within SAPS is supposed to look 
into the matter and take such decisions as are dictated by the 
law and the policies of SAPS.  
Whether somebody has already looked into the matt er and came to a 
decision that nothing should be done I do not know but I would like to 
know whether anything has been done and if so what it is.  Therefore I 
would like these concerns – this issue to be brought to senior 
authorities within SAPS because it  is important to find out whether they 
know about the matter and they know whether anything has been done  
and if nothing has been done why nothing has been done, they can look 
10 
into the matter.  But as a commission we would definitely like to have 
full information as well because there is a suggestion in the evidence 
that as part of what was happening during the relevant time is that 
those officers who were doing their job in terms of investigating 
corruption cases were being victimised and other people were  not being 
dealt with even when there was a reason for them to be dealt with.  So 
we would like to look into that.  So the legal team and the secretary of 
the commission should communicate with the senior management of 
SAPS to establish whether particularly one I think they could go to the 
National Commissioner because he would be the one that would know 
20 
who in the hierarchy is supposed to have dealt with the matter and 
whether he is aware of it and would be able to cause information to be 
made available as to what has happened.  So no judgment has been 
made as to whether Colonel Madhoe should or should not be at work.  I 
have not heard Colonel Madhoe’s side of the story so the idea was 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 4 of 170 
 
certainly not that I have made any decision about whether or not he 
should be there.  What is important is to find out whether these 
allegations are known to SAPS?  What they have done about them if 
anything and even if they have not done anything why they have not 
done anything?  And then the matter can be taken from there.  All 
people will be given hear – a fair hearing by the commission no matter 
how serious the allegations against them are and their side of the story 
will be heard and considered properly and fairly and nobody will be 
presumed to be guilty of anything just b ecause a witness has said he or 
she did something.  Findings will be made at the end of the work of the 
10 
commission.  So everybody will be given a fair hearing no matter what 
has been said about them or against them.  That is the one thing I 
wanted to say.  The second thing I want to say is this.  Major General 
Booysen from the evidence that he has given has indicated that there 
are a number of court applications that he had to do.  He had to bring 
to court to deal with various matters.  In some of them ther e are 
judgments.  I would like the legal team to secure not only the 
judgments in regard to those matters but I would like the full set of 
papers in each application so that we can have a full picture of exactly 
what happened in regard to each matter and h ow people against whom 
20 
certain allegations were made how they responded in affidavits that 
were placed before the courts.  I would also like to see the findings 
that were made by those courts in regard to each matter and in this 
regard I would like the legal team to prepare for me for later use a list 
of all findings that have been made by the courts in the various 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 5 of 170 
 
applications where there is no appeal pending.  Maybe they can make 
them even if there is an appeal pending but a note can be made that in 
regard to that one specific ones there is an appeal pending.  Mr 
McBride also gave evidence and indicated that he had to go to court a 
few times where he brought applications.  I would like the same in 
regard to him.  And in regard to him I think I may have alr eady said this 
when he was giving evidence it is important to obtain documentation 
that was before the prosecutor who made the decision to prosecute and 
the information that was before the prosecutor when the charges were 
withdrawn, the criminal charges were withdrawn.  I want to know all of 
10 
that.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay we may proceed.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair I am informed that there 
are legal representatives at this venue who have not  placed themselves 
on record as yet.  With your indulgence …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let them place themselves on record.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there are those who wish to do so.  
ADV YUSUF PEER:  Thank you Chairperson.  My nam e is Yusuf Peer 
20 
from the Johannesburg Bar.  I appear on behalf of Minister Nathi 
Mthethwa to observe the current witness’s evidence.  I am instructed by 
Mabuza Attorneys and the lead counsel is Mr [indistinct] who is not 
present here but is part of the tea m.  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 6 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair to address – to firstly 
address some of the queries that you raised yesterday for attention.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Would you grant me the 
indulgence to deal with those now?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us deal with them now. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  Just one administrative 
or housekeeping issue.  All the exhibits that were handed up yesterday 
which starts at Exhibit Z[H], [I], [J ], [K], [L] have been consolidated into 
a blue folder. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  There is one additional exhibit 
that has been added. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it has been marked Z[M] to 
follow the sequenc e. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that particular exhibit is 
the case that Chair requested yesterday.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In relation to who took the 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a judgment? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  To withdraw.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 7 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay so that particular exhibit then will be 
marked Exhibit Z[M] – M in brackets.  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  C hair if I 
could just direct you to the relevant paragraphs of that case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE 
VERUSHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 The 
first 
paragraph 
is 
paragraph 53 which is on page 50, 50.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And to read into the record 53 
10 
reads: 
“This court is of the view that the ground of 
opposition premised on the alleged failure to exhaust 
internal remedies is misplaced.  Firstly the facts 
indicate that it was not Mokgatle and rather 
Abrahams who took the decision to withdraw the 
charges preferred against Jiba.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the one where Major General Booysen was 
saying three judges made a finding specifically that Mr Abrahams was 
the one who had made the decision despite the fact that he had 
20 
deposed to an affidavit saying he was not the one who made the 
decision. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The next relevant paragraph it 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 8 of 170 
 
is at page 52 of the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry do we know whether this is on appeal or 
not?  You do not know? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I am – I do not believe it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you can check later on?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can check later on.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  So the next relevant paragraph 
which is still part of the majority judgment is at page 52.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it is paragraph 59. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It reads: 
“Having regard to what is stated above it is the 
finding of this court that firstly the decision to 
withdraw 
charges 
against 
Jiba 
was 
taken 
by 
Abrahams on recommendation by Mogatle.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :   
“Secondly the reasons advanced for the withdrawal 
20 
of charges against Jiba are based on the material 
error of law which falls short of the legality expected 
in a rational decision.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :   
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 9 of 170 
 
“And thirdly the defence that Freedom Under Law has 
not exhausted the internal remedies by seeking a 
review of the decision to prosecute has no merit.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The last paragraph which is of 
relevance to is part of the dissenting judgment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Where it is – Chair can find on 
page 80 at paragraph 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And with your leave if I may 
read?  It is under the heading “The decision to withdraw against Ms 
Jiba.” 
“Both Mr Abrahams and Mr Mogatle say in their affi davits that it was Mr 
Mogatle and not Mr Abrahams who took the decision.  Mr Abrahams 
with the wording of Section 22 (2) C of the NPA Act in mind says that 
he did not take the decision for the very reason that after Mr Mogatle 
had taken the decision he, Mr  Abrahams would be able to review the 
decision of Mr Mogatle.  Mr Abrahams does not say what he would have 
done had Mr Mogatle been in favour of continuing the prosecution of Ms 
20 
Jiba.  Mr Abrahams was not bound by the view of Mr Mogatle.  Mr 
Abrahams could had he so determined continued with the prosecution.  
What 
Mr 
Mogatle 
had 
sent 
to 
Mr 
Abrahams 
was 
merely 
a 
recommendation rather than a decision.  Section 22 (2) C does not 
provide for the review of a recommendation.  In my view the decision 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 10 of 170 
 
was taken by Mr Abrahams.  I make no adverse credibility finding 
against either Mr Abrahams or Mr Mogatle.  I simply prefer my 
interpretation of the facts and the law to theirs.  This finding makes it 
unnecessary for me to consider the lack of authority to delegate poi nt.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you know whether the majority says anything 
along the lines that they are not making any credibility finding as well 
in the majority judgment or is that something you are not sure about?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I do not specifically recall that 
but I am happy to double check and revert.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair sorry for 
interruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There are credibility 
findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would know this judgment quite well.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And paragraphs 55 to 
58. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  They are not 
credibility findings against both Advocate Shaun Abrahams.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And Advocate 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 11 of 170 
 
Marshall Mogatle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is paragraphs 55 to 58?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In the majority 
judgment Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you that is very 
helpful. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you General Booysen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know whether it i s on appeal? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I think there –  
CHAIRPERSON:  How long ago was it maybe first?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I will have to 
check but what I do recall Chair that there was an appeal by the NPA 
and also by I think Advocate Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am not too sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How far that process is. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  One of the parties 
withdrew but I think there could be an appeal still pend ing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay no thank you very much.  Yes thank 
you.  Well unfortunately I was looking – I was trying to see when 
judgment was handed down – when the judgment was handed down.  
Unfortunately the only date given there is the date when – well there is 
30 and 31 October 2017 as the dates when the matter was heard and 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 12 of 170 
 
then at the top of page 32 there is a date for the revision of the 
judgment being 21 December 2017.  So will – so it would have been 
handed down sometimes towards the end of 2 017.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  According to my research. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  This was specifically on the 
12 t h well it referenced the date of the 12 December 20 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  But it is certainly not reflected 
in here so I stand to be corrected.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think maybe the – the legal team 
should just check whether there is still an appeal pending in regard  to 
the matters. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Will do Chair.  If that disposes 
of that query the next query relates to the appointments.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The National Prosecuting – 
National Prosecuting Authorities Act…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what appointment – that one? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair a query was raised 
yesterday as to who is authorised …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh to appoint an acting DPP?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 13 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I have a copy of the National 
Prosecuting Authority Act should you so wish.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you…  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  But I am happy to just…  
CHAIRPERSON:  If you just tell me what it says that is enough.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chapter 3 in particular deals 
with the appointments of various members within the NDPP – within the 
Prosecuting Authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in relation to the 
appointment of Deputy Directors it says tha t the Minister may apologies 
it is Section 15 of the Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It says that the Minister may 
subject to the laws governing the public service  in Section 16(4) and 
after consultation with the National Director app oint a Deputy Director 
of Public Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that not be a national of – person as opposed 
to a provincial DPP?  I am not sure you know these – the structure of 
20 
the NPA can be confusing.  So we are looking for who – who has the 
power to appoint an acting DPP – Provincial DPP and I do not even 
think it is called Provincial DPP.  It is – it is the Provincial 
representative of the NDPP.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair if I may there are 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 14 of 170 
 
essentially – this particular Act governs the appointment of three, four 
positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The first is the national 
director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :    That is under Section 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The second is the deputy 
national director. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :    Which is Section 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The third is the appointment of 
directors and acting directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  That is Section 13.  Section 15 
as I have…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And who does it say – that is where it says the 
Minister? 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  For the appointment of 
directors and acting directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  The President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it says the President. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 15 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  After consultation with the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the national director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  May appoint a director of public 
prosecutions in respect of the office of prosecuting authority.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the last deals with the 
appointment of prosecutors generally at Section 16.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. No thank you.  But is that not a little strange?  
A provision that you read earlier on said the Minister may appoint and I 
thought you were talking about what a deputy director …  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  That was the deputy director 
Chair.  Whereas the appointment of directors and acting directors.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is the President. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The last query that we were 
able to deal with relates to…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Advocate Noko would have therefore have been 
appointed by the President in terms of that?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  My understanding is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright and later on you can just check and 
we can correct – we can correct whatever we have said if we have 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 16 of 170 
 
misunderstood who appoints who.  That is fine.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I could just then summarise.  
A national director, a deputy national director and directors and acting 
directors are all appointed by the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Be it independently or in 
consultation with…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And other stake holders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The next query that was raised 
relates to the interview of Advocate Noko.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thankfully we were able to 
extract the relevant excerpt of the interview.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Which relates to her responses 
on the Booysen matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is in fact ready and available 
to be viewed should you so wish?  It is too…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja or no we do not need to view it as if we have got 
transcripts that would be enough.  You do not have a transcript you just 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 17 of 170 
 
have the… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just the clip and the relevant 
clip.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you have watched it you can just confirm 
whether – what the witness said is actually what happened.  But 
otherwise a transcript can be made later on and made available.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Unfortunately a transcript was 
– is not available at yet. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  But having looked at it…  
CHAIRPERSON:  In due course then it is fine. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Having looked at the video she 
does mention on at least three occasions.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  That Booysen’s matter or other 
prominent matters, high profile matters in particular were in fact on the 
court roll when she was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When she was appointed as acting director of public 
20 
prosecutions? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Just arrangements must be made for us 
to just get a transcript of that relevant part.  We do not need to have a 
transcript of the whole interview.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 18 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and it need not be now we can get it in due 
course. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  There are other matters but 
those are still being attended to.  Can I then suggest that we r esume 
where we left yesterday General Booysen?  And that is on page 41 of 
Exhibit Z[A].  So yesterday General Booysen you gave evidence about 
various prosecutors who are – whose names in fact populate slide that 
10 
– slide 4 which is – forms part of the diagrams bundle.  And the last 
prosecutor that you gave evidence in regard to was Advocate Shaun 
Abrahams.  Is there anything that you wish to add following on the 
evidence that you gave yesterday in relation to him in view of the 
judgment that has now been presented to the Chair? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair.  
Chair not really except that the diagram that was shown yesterday 
pertains to the Amigo case, the Panday matter, the looting of the Secret 
Services account and then the Cato Manor matter.  I did mention that 
yesterday but I would just like to reiterate it.  These same prosecutors 
20 
invariably were also involved in the prosecution of members from SARS 
and also Colonel Sibiya and Dramat in this so called rendition saga.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Following on from the 
judgment that has been handed up in your view what ought to have 
been the consequences in relation to the prosecution of or rather the 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 19 of 170 
 
charges against Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair although there 
is a majority and a minority judgment but in the end all three the judges 
set aside the withdrawal of charges by Advocate Abrahams.  Advocate 
Jiba had already appeared in court.  The withdrawal then was set aside 
by a full bench of the high court.  So my understanding then is they 
should go back to where they – they were that the matter should be 
placed back on the roll.  My understanding is that Advocate Abrahams 
then sent the docket to Advocate Smith from North West.  Whether 
Advocate Smith had the authority or the jurisdiction to review what 
10 
Advocate Abrahams – Advocate Ferreira and Van Eerden has already 
decided upon that is an open question.  But to me it is almost akin to 
contempt of court for the court to make a finding and then fo r Advocate 
Abrahams not to place it back on the role but to send it to another 
advocate to review the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know who – or was it Mr Gerrie Nel who was – 
who had been appointed to prosecute in the matter originally?   Who 
had been the prosecutor. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No.  No Chair it was 
Advocate Ferreira. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And Van Eeden. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, they were – they were the prosecutors or 
they were handling it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They were handling it.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 20 of 170 
 
They were appointed by Advocate  Nxasana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
They 
were 
both 
prosecuting in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Jiba had 
already appeared in court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They had already 
prepped 
me. 
 
We 
had 
already 
done 
our 
consultations 
when 
10 
Advocate Abrahams withdrew the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so once the court had se t aside the 
decision to withdraw the charges the matter should have been pursued.  
That is prosecution and one would have expected that the same 
prosecutors who had been prosecuting the matter would continue 
unless there was some valid reason to change the m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Indeed Chair what I – 
what I also read in the judgment is that – and I find it quite strange – 
that Advocate Abrahams between him and Advocate  Mokgatle had 
reviewed 
the 
matter 
without 
Advocate  Jiba 
having 
made 
20 
representations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So it was an initiative 
by Advocate Abrahams without representations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 21 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not know whether 
she subsequently made representations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And in – and that is 
the reason why it was sent to Advocate Smit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  If not then I – well I 
would then say the case should have been placed back on the – on the 
court roll. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Without having. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Without sending it to 
another almost like second guessing or – it almost like forum shopping 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To find a prosecutor 
who will eventually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  (Indistinct) the matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well the legal team should look into that.  All 
these matters that we – that are coming up we need to know exactly 
what happened, what are the facts and so on and so on and it is 
important to get all the facts because with regard to prosecution you 
may have a case where somebody makes in good faith an error of law 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 22 of 170 
 
and does something that maybe seen as not right but you may have a 
case where it is not an error of law.  It is something serious and 
therefore it becomes very important to get the facts right.  What exactly 
happened, who did what, what was before him or her befo re she made 
that decision.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can now then turn to paragraph 
136 which is on page 41 of your affidavit?  You now talk about other 
prosecutors.  What do you mean by other prosecutors?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair when this whole 
investigation – if I can say the Cato Manor investigation - started it was 
10 
amazing how many resources was utilised in that investigation.  I think 
at one stage they had about nine prosecutors camping in Durban in a 
hotel on the beachfront.  I would say for more than a year.  Every time 
we would go to court there was an entourage of prosecutors - five to six 
sometimes seven prosecutors but on average at least four prosecutors 
and there had been 20 remands.  17 or 16 of them i n the High Court.  
The prosecutors knew. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like in one matter or they were there – they were 
covering a number of matters the same prosecutors or it was a team – 
a large team of prosecutors in regard to each matter?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair.  In the 
matter in which myself and Cato Manor were prosecuted.  The lead 
prosecutor - Advocate Maema – knew the matter was not going to 
proceed and in spite of that they would every time fly down the day 
before book – check into a hotel a number of prosecutors.  I would even 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 23 of 170 
 
– I would even go as far to say they could have used a local prosecutor 
to have the matter remanded because it is – it was like a – all those 
appearances were like three/four minutes and most of the discussions 
took place in chambers and we would go into court and the actual 
proceedings would be two or three minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And there were a 
number of advocates involved in this – in the prosecution of Cato 
Manor 
and 
I 
do 
mention 
some 
– 
some 
of 
them 
here 
like 
Advocate J J Mlotshwa who incidentally also happens to be involved in 
10 
other 
prosecutions 
of 
people 
fighting 
prosecution. 
 
There 
is 
Advocate Dawood Adams.  Now Chair Advocate  Dawood Adams - there 
had been an investigation against Advocate Dawood Adams by the SSU 
previously where he was charged with the Witness Protection Program 
and it emerged that while he was in charge of the program he 
appropriated funds from the program for his own personal benefit.  He 
had booked – I think it was two apartments in the beach front – the 
Waterfront area in Cape Town where his children stayed while they 
were studying at university and the other one was used by himself and 
friends.  When he was eventually caught out after this investigat ion - I 
20 
think the investigation was done by Mr  Willie Hofmeyr – certain 
recommendations were made for disciplinary steps.  As far as I know 
nothing was done about that for whatever reason – there might have 
been valid reasons but what concerns me is there you have an 
advocate from the National Prosecuting Authority stealing money.  That 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 24 of 170 
 
is what it is and he does not even get a slap.  I know – I know at the 
time he was suspended for a while – I think – but no criminal charges 
were pressed against him.  Yet Advocate Abrahams uses the same - 
Advocate Dawood Adams sends him to Greece to go and find evidence 
against me and that is what I find so abhorrent.  That people from a 
National Prosecuting Authority there is prima facie evidence that they 
have committed a serious criminal offence.  They are being used to 
investigate people who are investigating corruption.  The few 
prosecutors I have mentioned now Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to – to those just some clarity.  The 
10 
large team of prosecutors that you tal k about that would be brought -
would come to Durban for the Cato Manor matter even when everyone 
knew they would be a postponement – would those be from Head 
Office?  Is that right or would it be a mix of local and Head Office 
prosecutors? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair there were no 
local prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
It 
is 
always 
Advocate Maema, Raymond Mathenjwa, J J Mlotshwa and a few others 
20 
and as far as I am concerned they were wasting taxpayers’ money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Flying five to six 
people down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 25 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From Johannesburg to 
– to Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Knowing the case was 
going to be remanded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Check into a hotel on 
the beach front. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then fly back the 
10 
following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how often did this happen – if you are able to 
tell?  I mean I know you talked. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 20 or 19. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
in 
the 
beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Postponements. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In the beginning in the 
High Court appearances it was like a circus at the court.  They would 
have caspers standing outside, snipers on the roof, personal body 
protection and I think it was here by abo ut the 8 t h or the 9 t h appearance 
at the High Court that I commented in the media that they are wasting 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 26 of 170 
 
taxpayers’ money by flying this whole entourage down just to do a 
remand and after that comment of mine the figures tapered down but in 
the last couple appearances there would at least be – at least two or 
three advocates with – with other personnel from the National 
Prosecuting Authority.  Whether they were protectors or whether they 
were media liaison officers I do not know, but on average the last 
couple there were to be about four to five but prior to my complaint 
there were some times be up to five to six prosecutors who fly down – 
up and down just to come and do a remand.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen were you involved 
10 
in the matter that you alluded to in relation to Advocate  Dawood Adams 
as in were you part of the investigation team at all?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair.  I had 
nothing to do with the investigation against Advocate  Dawood.  It came 
to my knowledge and attention whereas he was sent to Greece to find 
evidence against me obviously having an investigator background then 
you start to investigate the people who – who are against you and I 
established that he – he himself was a subject of a criminal – well not 
of a criminal investigation and it is clear from that report by 
Advocate Willie Hofmeyr 
that 
money 
was 
appropriated 
by 
20 
Advocate Dawood which in my view is – either constitutes fraud or theft 
but nothing happens to him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both in terms of criminal charges and internal 
disciplinary matters nothing happened as far as you know?  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 27 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair as far as I – 
well what I have heard with regards to the disciplinary matters or the 
disciplinary matter I think the period during which they had to take 
steps had lapsed.  That is my understanding.  So whether it was done 
on purpose or not I cannot comment on that but theft and fraud 
prescribes after 20 years not like in a disciplinary matter that it 
prescribes in 60 days.  So I – I cannot understand why no theft charges 
or fraud charges were preferred against Advocate  Adams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then turn to page 42 
10 
where you deal with prosecutors who resigned due to interference and 
in particular you mention certain prosecutors who in your view resigned 
for that reason.  Can you please explain to the Chair in that regard?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I will start with 
Advocate Bheki Mnyathi who personally told me at the High Court in 
Durban that because of what was happening to him – as Chair would 
recall 
he 
was 
the 
prosecutor 
who 
was 
going 
to 
prosecute 
Toshan Panday and Colonel Navin Madhoe for the attempt to bribe me.  
He is the one who received the let ter from Advocate Mrwebi essentially 
querying the prosecution and he then penned a legal opinion and 
20 
indicated that he was going to indict Colonel  Madhoe in the High Court 
for corruption and he told me personally that his stance on the matter 
had caused him to be overlooked for promotion and he intended 
resigning 
which 
he 
in 
the 
end 
did. 
 
I 
know 
that 
Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa because of what had happened to him in 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 28 of 170 
 
KZN he also resigned from the NPA.  Both those advocates are now in 
private 
practice. 
 
Then 
there 
is 
Advocate Gerrie Nel 
and 
Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach.  Both - in the instances that I have 
testified about were both involved in a number of those prosecutions.  
Gerrie Nel was involved with the previous prosecution of Mr  Selebi but 
both also left because of – of what was happening at the NPA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that either the investigators or the legal team 
have been in touch with at least some of those and that either they will 
be coming forward to testify or at least we know what they have to say.  
So if it has not been taken care of it should be taken care of.  We 
10 
should at least speak to each one of those people and if they have got 
information that falls within the term of reference we should have them 
give evidence in due course.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  In that instance 
can I ask us to look at Bundle/EXHIBIT Z(D) which is the diagrams 
bundle and slide 4 which is currently displayed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So General Booysen you mentioned 
20 
an Advocate Mzinyathi.  Just for the record the periphery circle that 
appears 
on 
the 
bottom 
right 
hand 
side 
is 
that 
the 
same 
Advocate Mzinyathi that you had just given evidence about ? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Not audible). 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 29 of 170 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not see his name here.  Is he here – is his name 
here? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the periphery circle at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Right hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one at the bottom of page 4. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No it is not the same 
Mzinyathi.  This is the one from Gauteng.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair, which I testified 
about yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I think – I think it will then be important 
that we have initials to differentiate which one we are dealing with at 
any one time. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I think this one is an 
Ms Mzinyathi and the other one is Mnyathi Chair if I am not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but the one that you were talking from Durban is 
Mzinyathi is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No.  He is Mnyathi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mnyathi not Mzinyathi? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Bheki 
– 
Bheki Mnyathi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And the one from 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 30 of 170 
 
Gauteng is Mzinyathi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  I thought you said Mzinyathi earlier on.  So 
that might have confused Ms September as well.  Okay.  So the one in 
Durban is Mnyathi not Mzinyathi, okay.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and then the key at the 
bottom - on the bottom left hand side talks to common prosecutors 
involved in more than one case.  Is th at correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so for the record it is recorded 
that Advocate Mrwebi was involved in the Panday case and the Amigos 
10 
case.  Advocate Mosing in the Amigos case and the Cat o Manor case 
and Advocate Noko in the Panday case, the Amigos case and the Cato 
Manor case? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There was evidence led in relation to 
Advocate Mrwebi’s role in the Mdluli loo ting of the Secret Service 
Account.  Is there any particular reason why he is not recorded to have 
been included in that one to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I did not have 
enough information – personal information although I was subsequently  
20 
obviously privy to the Justice  Mokgoro Report and other newspaper 
reports.  I – I did not have enough at my disposal to add him there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so this diagram then represents 
the evidence in your affidavit at the time that you deposed to it.  Is that 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 31 of 170 
 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen do you know of a 
prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry.  I am not sure that I unde rstand this 
diagram completely.  The key at the bottom has go Cato Manor written 
in a certain colour and I take it that that colour is not exactly the same 
as the colour where you have got many prosecutors starting with 
Advocate Chauke at the top but I tak e it that that portion of the – of 
10 
that circle tells us the names of prosecutors who were involved in the 
Cato Manor case.  Would that be right Major -General Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair that – that 
would be the circle to the – to the right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, to the right yes.  In other words where it says 
Cato Manor at the bottom there.  It is more or less the same colour as 
that portion of the circle where you have got a number of names.  So I 
am taking it that what it does mean is that those prosecutors whose 
name appear in that portion of the green circle where involved in the 
Cato Manor case.  Is that right?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
They 
were 
Chair 
although there were a number of other prosecutors whose names are.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are not included? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Are not included.  
There are – I recall there were two female prosecutors as well or lady 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 32 of 170 
 
prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who names I do not 
have.  I did not include them there.  So the ones that I have.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Some of them – for 
instance Advocate Adams I have included him there Chair because he 
was sent to Greece according to papers by Advocate  Shaun Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To go and establish if 
10 
he could find evidence against myself.  Him and Advocate  Maema. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was the sum 
total of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of his involvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Chauke I 
think was more an administrative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Role that he played in 
signing letters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocates Mathenjwa, 
Maema and J J Mlotshwa they were active involved in travelling to KZN 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 33 of 170 
 
and doing the prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Advocate Pretorius he 
was in the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On one occasion he 
wrote a legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Pertaining to Cato 
Manor investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I thought that the purpose of the diagram was to 
show the cross section of certain prosecutors in regard to different 
matters.  So in regard to the Cato Manor you can see there were a 
number of prosecutors but then in regard to the others it looks like you 
only see one name.  So I am n ot sure if I understand the purpose of the 
diagram correctly because it appears only – it appears that it is only 
the Cato Manor where you have a number of them and a few of them – I 
mean for example you have got Advocate  Jiba written there acting and 
DPP but her name is in a colour for which there is no key.  At least as 
far as I understand this.  So I am not able to make head or tail of what 
20 
her presence in that portion means and then you have Advocate  Mosing 
in a portion of a larger circle that is colour ed in a certain way but when 
I look at the certain key there is no colour like that.  So I do not know 
what it means to have him there.  Then you have Advocate  Vimbani his 
or her name – I do not know if it is a female or male – appears in a pink 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 34 of 170 
 
portion of a circle but I do not see a key that tells me what it means for 
what – what case that is or okay maybe the key is – part of the key is 
at the bottom.  Part of it is at the top.  I see Amigos case.  Maybe it 
means she was – he was involved in the Amigos ca se. Then the Panday 
investigation the colour is bluish.  So I guess that – that is – that 
shows that but I do not see other colours but also if you just see one 
prosecutor there I am not sure that it is in line with that I thought was 
the purpose of the diagram.  I thought the purpose was go – was to say 
look at the commonality of the same prosecutors and different cases.  
That is what I thought the idea was but I might be mistaken.  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair if I could assist.  
If we look at Advocate Jiba at the bottom perhaps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  This circle intercepts 
with other circles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So she – the main 
circle shares in this - the looting of the Secret Service Account and the 
role she played there was the withdrawal of charges against 
Richard Mdluli but her name also intercepts with the Cato Manor 
20 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what – what - is there a case that has got the 
colour where her name is because if the colour of the part where her 
name is was the same as the colour for the looting of Secret Service 
Account then it would tell me that she was involved in both Cato Manor 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 35 of 170 
 
and the looting – the looting of the Secret Service Account but b ecause 
it has got its own colour for which I find no key it confuses me or do I 
misunderstand? Maybe both of you understand this.  I am the only one 
who does not understand it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No, not at all Chair.  If I may 
General Booysen – the prosecutors who are reflected in this diagram is 
it a comprehensive list of all prosecutors involved in all four matters?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Bar the one or two 
who – whose names I do not know Chair – who I saw at court but whose 
names I do not know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Although their names 
appear in answering affidavits of Advocate  Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I do not know 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
these 
are 
certainly 
the 
prosecutors that you are aware of were involved in these four matters.  
Is that correct? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair 
but I just want to clarify one aspect there.  If you look at and it could 
perhaps be slightly misleading.  If you look at the top Chair the Panday 
investigation where you have Advocate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 36 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Dorian Paver. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He was the prosecutor 
who provisionally withdraw the charges.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In a R17 million case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But the reasons at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it 70 or 60?  60 million or 70 million?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair.  There was 
a 60 million one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then there was a 17 
million one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That was the 15 
million that the created invoices for.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Which 
eventually 
20 
turned – which eventually came to 17 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is 1-7? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  1-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 1-7, not 70.  Okay. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 37 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair in that 
matter Advocate Paver was the prosecutor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But because of the 
recordings that were indistinct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
He 
provisionally 
withdraw the matter and Chair would recall Chair asked me where – 
where that docket is now and my response was it is now with IPID.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do not want this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Picture to betray all 
these prosecutors as people being on the wrong side.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, ja because. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was my – that was my understanding that the 
diagram shows a group of prosecutors who seemed to feature in most 
20 
of these cases where people who were doing their job were being 
suspended charged and all.  That was – that was the impression I had 
but what you are saying is it is not all of them who appear on the 
(indistinct)? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is true Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 38 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not saying that about all of them?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is only some. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who exactly are those some?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
- 
Advocate Paver – I think I have already explained why he had 
withdrawn those charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Then 
there 
is 
Advocate Vimbani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Who is the – the Head 
of the Commercial Crime Court in KwaZulu -Natal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Whom I – whom I had 
not dealt with personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But she has taken 
over the investigation as – as Chair would recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The Amigos case that 
was with Advocate Dunywa. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 39 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  When – when the 
charges were withdrawn against Mabuyakhulu and Nkonyeni.  That 
docket was then taken away from Dunywa – Advocate Dunywa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
given 
to 
Advocate Vimbani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I will leave it at that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
prosecutors - Advocate Mrwebi - he has been involved with quite a 
number of these cases.

Page 40 of 170 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The common names though that 
appear in – through your observations – in more than one matter are 
thus 
Advocate Mrwebi, 
Advocate Noko, 
Advocate Mosing 
and 
Advocate Jiba.  Is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To move on in your statement we are 
now at page 43.  The next them of your statement relates to Law 
Enforcement and in particular the Hawks and the South African Police 
Services.  A similar diagram has accordingly been prepared as with the  
10 
prosecutors which can be found at page 5 of EXHIBIT Z(D).  Is it 
correct that the same rationale in the preparation of the one – of the 
diagram for prosecutions informed the preparation of this slide?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There are two persons in particular 
outside of others that your statement or rather your affidavit deals  with 
and the first person that you mentioned at page 43 of EXHIBIT ZA 
paragraph 140 is Major General Berning Ntlemeza.   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Major General Ntlemeza was 
20 
appointed on the 24 t h of December 2014 as the Acting Head of the 
Hawks, what were your observations following his appointment?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair for lack of a 
better word when he was appointed all hell broke loose within the 
DPCI, I cannot describe it in any other way.  He was appointed I think 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 41 of 170 
 
on the 25 t h or 24 t h of December, the very first thing he did and that’s 
what started to raise some red flags to me, the very first thing he did 
was I received a call from him six days after his appointment on New 
Year’s Eve in the afternoon. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Which year was this? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Two thousand and ... 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  2014 Chair, that’s just 
after General Dramat was suspended.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I received a call from 
him and he said to me that he would like to see me on the 1 s t of 
January, Chair normally your operational people work on the 1 s t of 
January, it’s the first time in m y police career of forty years of which I 
sat at home for more than three years, that I had been summoned to a 
meeting in the morning of a New Year ’s Day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On New Year’s Day? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you supposed to fly up to Gauteng?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair, I am going 
20 
to get to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair he wanted to 
see me at the Provincial Headquarters where my offic es are situated.  
Initially he told me he wanted to see me I think it was ten o’clock.  So I 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 42 of 170 
 
went to bed early on New Year’s Eve, I didn’t celebrate with the family, 
and I woke up that morning just after seven and it was Ntlemeza, 
General Ntlemeza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage you were not under suspension, one has 
got to try and just ...(intervention)  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I’m back at work 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are back at work at that time, okay.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes I’m back at work 
Chair, so I was in my post.  I was busy reviewing all these cases 
10 
against Panday, Madhoe, General Ngobeni etcetera.  I woke up just 
after seven, he phoned me he said to me no I need to come through 
now, he is at the office already.  So I sa id to him okay I’ll get dressed, 
which I did and I drove through to Durban, it took me about half an hour 
to get there, and on my arrival there I phoned him to ask him where he 
was, and he said to me no he’s on the 17 t h floor, with the Provincial 
Commissioner.  Normally Chair when the Head of the Hawks comes to 
KwaZulu Natal like General Dramat, he phones the Provincial Head like 
myself, or whoever if it’s Shadrack Sibiya in Gauteng or if it’s Matakata 
in Cape Town to make travel arrangements for him.  On t his instance he 
20 
made his own travel arrangements, he was fetched from the airport by a 
Colonel and taken to General Ngobeni’s office.  Now Chair would recall 
that Ngobeni at the time was the subject of a criminal investigation.  I 
went up to the 17 t h floor ...(intervention)  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Before you go up to the 17 t h floor 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 43 of 170 
 
who was the colonel that transported Major General Ntlemeza?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it was a Colonel 
Clarence Jones who was one of my colonels, so normally  I would get 
the call, I will designate someone to go and fetch whoever from the 
airport.  In this instance Colonel Clarence Jones was phoned, I do not 
know by whom, to fetch General Ntlemeza from the airport, and I 
mentioned Colonel Jones here specificall y because during the Panday 
investigation I was sitting in a restaurant, and I’m digressing a little bit 
now because the Advocate wants me to say who Jones is, I was sitting 
at a restaurant in Durban North at the Bite Your Tongue Restaurant 
10 
when Advocate Knox Molele, he’s from the National Prosecuting 
Authority, walked by and he saw me and he came and sat down with me 
and we had a chat and he told me that he’s got some concerns that 
Jones had been making contact with him, at that time Advocate Molele 
was the Head of Asset of Forfeiture in KZN, and he told me that Jones, 
who had absolutely nothing to do with the Panday investigation had 
approached him to write a letter to say that there’s no case in terms of 
assets forfeiture to have the fifteen million which  I had frozen released.   
 
Simultaneous to that Brigadier Lawrence Kemp, who was the 
Head of Finances in the Province, phoned me and asked me who 
20 
Colonel Jones was, so I said to him it’s one of the Colonels that report 
to me, so he said to me he was snooping around at the Financial 
offices making queries about the 15million I had frozen.  So I said to 
Kemp well just ignore him, he’s got nothing to do with that 
investigation, I had frozen the money and I will be the one that will 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 44 of 170 
 
unfreeze it.   
 
I wrote to General Ntlemeza no fewer than three, it could be 
four, it could even be five times, reporting Jones conduct to him, he 
never even bothered to acknowledge receipt of any of my letters, to 
such an extent that I phoned Brigadier Kubie Moodley, who is now the 
Head of the Hawks in the Free State, who is in charge of those 
investigations, those type of investigations, I said to him Kubie what is 
going on here, and I could sense a feeling of discomfort from Moodley 
and what I gathered from what he was trying to te ll me that he was 
being frustrated or inhibited by Ntlemeza.   
10 
 
So Chair back to the meeting at National Head – Provincial 
Head Quarters I went up in the lift and when I arrived on the 17 t h floor 
you turn to your left to go to the Provincial Commissioner’s  office and 
as I approached her office her secretary was also there, so she jumped 
up and said to me no, no wait, you must go and sit in another office 
there in the corner.  So I went and sat in a corner in another office.  
After about fifteen minutes Ntle meza joined me in the office and he 
asked me about number one what does my equity profile look like.  I 
thought it was strange because my equity profile was available on the 
system at his office, and then he complained and said to me no, no 
20 
you’ve got too many Indians here.  So I said well it’s none of my doing, 
I never did – all these people are from the Scorpions, I cannot just 
chase them away, I’ve inherited them.   
 
And then he said to me he needed a report from me, and I 
couldn’t understand what report it is that ...(intervention)  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 45 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did he say? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He wanted a report 
from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About what?  About the people who report to you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well inter alia about 
my equity profile and also about investigations that we were busy with, 
but he was very incoherent Chair, I couldn’t make out what he was 
trying to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, the equity profile referred to what?  
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 
My 
racial 
10 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the racial and gender representation of people 
under you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But Chair in my 
opinion that was just a guise to com e to KwaZulu Natal because what’s 
he doing talking to a suspect in my criminal investigation.  General 
Dramat would never have done that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and just to complete the story, I assume the 
20 
Provincial Commissioner was present at the office on t he day? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She was there as well 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that’s what really 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 46 of 170 
 
concerned me is he spends time with a suspect in a criminal 
investigation, then he tries to make me believe he’s there to look at my 
equity profile on the 1 s t of January 2015 in the morning, which didn’t 
make sense and he then asked me, Chair I’m not exaggerating, the way 
he communicates you can never figure what he wants or what he 
doesn’t want, so he asked me a for a report ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  What could have been so urgent about the gender 
and racial representation of staff under you on the 1 s t of the New Year. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair that was a ruse.  
That was a ruse to do something else.  And that ruse was he 
10 
immediately, well he – while Dramat was suspended I wrote out an 
application to fly to Cape Town, I wanted to go and see Dramat, 
because I knew Dramat was under severe strain at that time.  And my 
intention to go and see Dramat was to tell him to hang in there, that we 
need him, the country needs him, we need him there.  So I sent – when 
I sent the itinerary unbeknown, well I didn’t realise then until 
afterwards what his gripe with Dramat was, so I didn’ t say I wanted to 
go and see Dramat, I wrote there I want to go for investigations, and 
the thing came back immediately and he wanted a full report from me 
what do I want to go in Cape Town.  So I thought no I am not going to 
20 
do that so I bought my own plane ticket and I flew there and I went and 
I did have the meeting with General Dramat.  
 
So he says to me yes and what were you – what did you want 
to do in Cape Town and he caught me off guard, so I quickly had to 
think, I said no I wanted to go and see an investigator, Colonel Kobus 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 47 of 170 
 
Roelofse, but he happens to be on leave in Jeffreys Bay or something, 
which he was, so he says to me no he wants a report and then he – he 
says to me and he wants a report the following morning, no, no late 
that afternoon.  I had to phone Brigadier Maransela, Captain Pelser and 
Colonel Andre Laats to come into the office and extract all this 
information from the computers for him.   
 
When I was finished with – I then went home, a few minutes 
later he phones me he says to me no I must come back to town, he 
wants the thing now.  I got dressed again, all the way back to town, 
when I arrived there he wasn’t at the office, so I phoned him, I said 
10 
okay we’re almost done with the report, he says to me no I must now 
bring it to the airpor t.  Now I’m starting to get irritated with him, we 
basically had the same rank, although he was acting as the Head, I 
said to him why don’t you rather come to office, I’ve asked people to 
come in on the 1 s t of January, at least just come and greet them and  
say thank you for sacrificing the New Year’s day, so he says to me no 
he is busy patrolling on the beachfront now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Patrolling?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He’s busy patrolling 
on the beachfront, I don’t know what ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that his job? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was not his job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was your understanding of what he was 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 48 of 170 
 
saying, that he was patrolling, I mean it was obviously Festive Season 
and I come from Durban so I know that sometimes there are a lot of 
SAPS to make sure that on the beachfront you know people are safe 
and so on.  Was your understanding that’s what he meant?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Chair I will give him 
the benefit of the doubt, maybe he wanted to be hands -on, but I will 
give him the benefit of the doubt for that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So Chair so he says 
to me no, no, no he’s coming back now, I must meet him in front of the 
10 
office, so we hurriedly got the reports together and I took an envelope 
with the report that he wanted, which I thought he wanted, I went 
downstairs and Maransela was standing behind me and I think Colonel 
Laats was also there, and I think Pelser.  So he sat, and that’s when I 
saw Colonel Jones is driving around in the Provincial Commissioner’s 
car, not a private car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Provincial Commissioner’s car?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  One of the State 
official cars not a private car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And I immediately felt 
uncomfortable, I mean Colonel Jones had reported to him, he is driving 
him around, he is driving him around in a police vehicle that’s allo cated 
to the Provincial Commissioner, he is meeting with the Provincial 
Commissioner who is a suspect of mine, but he was sitting in the back 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 49 of 170 
 
of the car.  So he pressed the button for the window to go down and I 
bent over and I gave him the report and the envelope and he looked 
into the envelope and he says no but it’s empty.  I said no the report 
must go inside there.  He had a look at the report and said no, no, no, 
no, Chair that man has got a very – I cannot describe to you how he 
talks to people, and he started shouting no, no, and then I had had 
enough of him, I said to him listen here then you need to start 
communicating properly, and he could see that I was angry so he 
jumped out of the car and he took me by the arm and he took me 
around the back and he says no, no, no, no Johan let us not fight.  I 
10 
said to him but you don’t – I don’t know what it is that you want.  Then 
he said to me the report he actually wanted was why did I want to go to 
Cape Town.  Brigadier Maransela actually came to me and pull ed me 
back and he said to me General just leave it.  
 
Maransela travelled with me in my car because he also, we 
live in the same suburb, well we used to, and on the way back to 
Amanzimtoti he phoned me and he was on speaker phone, that’s now 
Ntlemeza now, and he says to me hey Johan we mustn’t fight, you know 
you people in KZN you are the best and he was basically boosting, I 
mean Maransela still ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Kind of apologising indirectly or something like that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Indirectly Chair, and 
then Maransela looked at me and he just shook his head and I also just 
shook my head.  So Chair the first thing he did after his appointment 
was to come and to meet one of my suspects.  The second thing he did 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 50 of 170 
 
is I know from there, I haven’t got the exact dates, he travelled to Cape 
Town where the lead investigator in the looting of the Secret Services 
account was Colonel Kobus Roelofse.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying now in Cape Town?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In Cape Town Chair, it 
could have been a day after or a day or two later, but he travelled from 
Durban to Cape Town and there he indirectly intimidated Roelofse, 
Roelofse told me that himself, and later on he took away the 
investigation from Roelofse.  Chair there was another investigation that 
we were doing at KZN that I will perhaps talk about later on, it might be 
10 
irrelevant, which I had to engage with Roelofse and Roelofse expressed 
his frustrations, he was almost, the impression that I gained, because I 
wanted to come and see us in KwaZulu Natal and he said to me he 
can’t, he’s been bound, he cannot leave the office, it’s almost like he 
was shackled to stay in the Western Cape.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in regard to the investigation that – do you say 
it’s Roelofse, what was the name of the ...(intervention)  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Colonel Kobus 
Roelofse Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Roelofse? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to pronounce it correctly.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything significant about the investigation 
from which he was taken off by General Ntlemeza?  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 51 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair it’s highly 
significant because Kobus Roelofse, C olonel Kobus Roelofse was the 
lead and main investigator in the looting of the Secret Services 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I understood I think yesterday that the 
looting of the Secret account that we talked about related to KZN, is 
that the same or it’s different provinces?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no Chair so the 
initial investigation into the looting of the Secret Services account were 
initiated from a report by General Mark Hanckle which was signed off 
10 
by Dr de Kock.  That was almos t, if I can call it the whistle blowing 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, report. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Simultaneous to that I 
think General Dramat then was overseeing the investigation from Head 
Office but the actual investigator for the looting of  the – we call it the 
slush fund, was Colonel Kobus Roelofse.  At the very same time that 
Kobus Roelofse got involved with that investigation General Shadrack 
Sibiya got – reopened the kidnapping and the murder case of which 
General Magule was a suspect an d he was also a suspect in the looting 
20 
of the slush fund.  So at a much later stage when General Mkhwanazi 
became the Acting National Commissioner he also directed, because by 
then there were indications that there was a KwaZulu Natal leg of the 
looting of the slush fund by Crime Intelligence.   
 
General 
Mkhwanazi 
then 
appointed 
Brigadier 
Simon 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 52 of 170 
 
Madonsela, the one that I know, to investigate that leg.  That was a 
much smaller leg, the investigation that Roelofse did was much more 
comprehensive, and it was mu ch bigger than the one that Madonsela 
did in KZN Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the one that Colonel Roelofse was conducting may 
be described as the National Investigation relating to the Secret 
Account, or not really?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I would say so Chair, 
because ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to differentiate it from the one in KZN, 
10 
differentiate from the leg, the KZN leg as you call it.  So the National 
leg and the KZN leg would that help to distinguish which investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I would say the 
Western Cape leg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the Western Cape leg. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL 
BOOYSEN :  Although the 
investigations that Colonel Roelofse did also included cases that 
occurred here in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but he and Madonsela were doing these 
investigations independent, it’s not like one was helping the other, was 
20 
under another one. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  They were doing it 
independently Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Independently, so it would be  in order to talk about 
them independently. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 53 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe the KZN leg and the Western Cape leg, 
even though maybe the Western Cape from what you say might not be 
completely accurate, but if we say Western Cape leg then we know 
which one we’re talking about. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That will be the 
Roelofse one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair we are informed that Colonel 
Kobus Roelofse will be coming to t he Commission to give evidence 
10 
himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that’s fine, I just wanted to make sure as we 
talk further I don’t get confused because there was the KZN one so if 
we talk about the KZN leg then I know which one, if we talk about the 
Western Cape one then I know which one we’re talking about.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then would now be an 
appropriate time to take the short adjournment?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s take the tea adjournment, it’s now twenty 
past, we will resume at twenty to twelv e.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we may proceed. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  General 
Booysen we are now at paragraph 150 of your affidavit which is at page 
46.  You had already alluded to Ntlemeza, sor ry you have already 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 54 of 170 
 
alluded before the tea adjournment to Major General Ntlemeza’s 
involvement in the matter which has become commonly known as the 
Renditions Matters which in particular dealt with the rendition of certain 
Zimbabweans, is that correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN : That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  To what extent are you aware 
of Major General Mtlemeza’s involvement with…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms September.  Let me just go back Major 
General Booysen to your meeti ng with General Mtlemeza on the 1 
January 2014.  Is my understanding correct that the only – there are 
10 
only two issues that he raised with you?  One was what the gender and 
racial dis – representation of people under you were and two that he 
asked 
for 
a 
report 
from 
you? 
 
There 
might 
have 
been 
a 
misunderstanding of a report about what but he asked for a report from 
you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are the only things?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Those were the only 
two things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  General at 
paragraph 150 you talk about an engagement or an interaction rather 
that you have with a certain Mr Innocent Khuba?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I am sorry Ms September again.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 55 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave him the report that you gave him, is that 
right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN : That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when did you hear from him ab out that report or I 
do not necessarily – I am not necessarily looking for a date but I just 
want to see if this was something that was so urgent that it needed to 
be dealt with on the 1 January.  How quickly did he deal with it?  
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
JOHAN 
WESSEL  
BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
my 
understanding was that he needed a report pertaining to operational 
matters.  That is why I called in those officers.  But that evidently was 
10 
not what he wanted.  He wanted something else.  And when I – when he 
told me that – that is not what he wanted he then indicated to me no he 
wanted to know why did I want to go to Cape Town?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you did give him a report about Cape Town 
at some stage? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No.  No Chair I did 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he did not ask for it – did not pursue it? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No he – when he 
realised – well when I realised that is not what he wanted to know he 
20 
said to me now I should favour him with the report but I just ignored 
him I did not send him one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he never pursued that?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it be correct to say for all intents and 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 56 of 170 
 
purposes to the extent that he wanted to see you on the 1 January for 
asking the report – asking you to give him a report about that issue he 
asked for a report that when he did not get from you he did not pursue?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That would be a 
correct interpretation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the only other reason why he wanted  to meet you 
on the 1 January was to ask you about the gender and racial 
representation of people under you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you give him an answer on that day in regard 
10 
to the question of r acial and gender representation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I could not give 
him a – I told him I could give him an average more or less.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I did not have the 
stats in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The fact is he had 
those stats available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  At his own office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So that to me was a 
ruse to come and ask me about equity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 57 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I said to him look I 
have got about so many colonels, so many captains and then he said to 
me how many Indian colonels have you got?  So I said, I guess about 
19.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then he said to 
me no, no, no you got too many Indians.  So I said to him but he must 
realise with our amalgamation of organised crime, commercial crime 
and the Scorpions I then became the – I inherited those persons.  I 
could not just now turn them away.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he – did he later on – a week, two weeks, a 
month, three months, six months revert to you about the issue of the 
gender and racial representation of the people under you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So both of the issues that he raised were issues that 
he never took further? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  He did not Chair and 
that is why I interpret his visit on the 1 January about equity and that – 
and a trip to Cape Town as a ruse to link up with the provincial 
commissioner. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  At that particular time 
the national commissioner was General Riah Phiyega.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And later on it became 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 58 of 170 
 
clear to me that there was – because in my disciplinary hearing General 
Phiyega also testified.  And in that hearing I openly accused of 
protecting General Ngobeni.  And she said to me no she is not. And I 
pointed out to her well you are aware of the fact that there are these 
allegations of corruptions that – corruption that is being investigated.  
And she was under oath.  And she said no it is not true.  Then I said – 
and I knew that she was going to say that so I brough t with me to my 
hearing my application in the Jiba review matter in which I mentioned 
her as a respondent.  I think she was respondent number 3.  So I gave 
her the document.  I said you the respondent in which I detail the 
10 
nature of the corruption so you c annot say that you did not know about 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So I – what I am 
trying to say is to me there was appears to have been an alliance 
between General Ngobeni and General Phiyega.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And with Ntlemeza 
being appointed I think and that is my observation Chair that he – one 
of his first tasks were to go and take care of that particular 
20 
investigation against General Ngobeni and then secondly to go and 
interfere with the investigation of Colonel Kobus Roelofse.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Certainly there is nothing that was said at the 
meeting at your meeting with him that showed why these two issues 
were so urgent and the fact that later on he never pursued them or 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 59 of 170 
 
followed them up might suggest that – might mean that – there might 
not have been a proper justification to want to meet on the 1 January 
these things could have been dealt with in the normal course?  Okay 
thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Before we 
get to paragraph 150 can you turn to page 45 and at paragraph 146?  
You make the statement that the real extent of the nefarious alliance 
between Major General Ntlemeza, Mr Richard Mdluli was laid bare in 
the affidavit of Mr Innocent Khuba.  Can you please explain what is 
meant by that? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair Mr Innocent 
Khuba is from IPID.  When Mr McBride and myself met when I returned 
back to work I met Mr Khuba and he was part of the team appointed by 
Mr McBride.  So they were revisiting the Panday investigation and the 
investigations that had become dormant in my absence.  But at the 
same time obviously one discusses other issues as well and at that 
time they were under pressure because of the so called rendition thing.  
And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to clarify when you talk about IPID or Mr 
Khuba and McBride investigating the Panday matter what you mean is 
20 
they were not doing the investigation that you and your team were 
doing but they were investigating whether there may have b een any 
misconduct or other unacceptable conduct on the part of any member of 
the police in regard to the conduct of that investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No Chair what 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 60 of 170 
 
happened is when I returned back to my office Chair would recall I 
received a telephone call from Mr McBride.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Obviously he had now 
become aware of what was going on and I do not know in the media or 
whether someone reported that to him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I then gave him a 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And because IPID had 
oversight over SAPS  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  We decided and for 
tactical reasons as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  For IPID to take over 
these investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so they – they effectively were going to do what 
your team had been doing. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But would that fall within their mandate?  My 
understanding has been that theirs is to look at complaints about the 
conduct of police officers as opposed to investigating the actual crimes 
committed by people who are not police officers?  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 61 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair their mandate is 
twofold.  One is to investigate certain criminal offences against SAPS 
members like death in custody.  Rape by police officers.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And then there is also 
that – also that nice little ride at the bottom that says any case that the 
head of IPID decide to allocate to IPID.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The second – the 
second leg of their mandate is if they investigate with the IC – with the 
previous ICD Act they could make recommendations about disciplinary 
steps but with the new IPID Act they – they can actually instruct the 
police to initiate disciplinary steps.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But they can do the 
criminal investigation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  No thank you I just wanted to understand 
that.  Thank you. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I interrupted you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem Chair.  General 
Booysen you attach a copy of an affidavit by Mr Innocent Khuba which 
is marked JWB19 and that can be found in Exhibit Z[B].   
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 62 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that B for Beatrice?  Is that B for Beatr ice? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or D for Doris? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  B for Beatrice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is one of the lever arch files 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And it is page 291 it is the first 
annexure in the bundle. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  We are informed that Mr 
Innocent Khuba will also be providing evidence before this commission 
and so we do not intend to go through the detail of this affidavit but 
merely just to highlight certain aspects of it.  General Booysen can you 
in summary inform the importance of this affidavit for purposes of your 
evidence? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  In summary Chair and 
as early as 2013 when General Dramat was the head of the Hawks 
Chair would recall that there now were investigations against Richard 
20 
Mdluli.  The initial investigation I did not mention – I do not think – I 
might have mentioned that in my statement.  The initial investigation 
into the alleged murder case and the kidnapping case at some point in 
time had also been done by General Mtlemeza before he was – he 
became the head of the Hawks.  I cannot recall what his position was.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 63 of 170 
 
He basically white-washed that investigation to say tha t there is no 
case.  But what…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that investigation against Mdluli?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But that was a wishy 
washy investigation that he conducted Chair.  What e merges from 
Khuba’s statement is that as early as 2013 there seems to have been 
an unholy alliance between Mdluli and Ntlemeza to get rid of Dramat.  
Because after the Sunday Times’ so called expose on the rendition 
10 
matter Dramat gets suspended and they ar e now facing Dramat and 
Sibiya are now facing the charges of rendition.  There was an initial 
report which Innocent Khuba from IPID wrote that I think went to 
Parliament in which he indicates that there appears to be a case to 
answer by General Dramat and Shadrack Sibiya.  But the investigation 
had not been concluded and I still recall asking Mr Khuba Innocent I 
said to him, Innocent we both investigators something is not right here.  
Why did you advance a report on the investigation which you know was 
not complete yet?  And his answer to me because I said to him, I am 
going to cross-examine you I am going to be a lawyer now I am going to 
20 
cross-examine you.  And that is how I spoke to him.  Because it did not 
make sense.  You do not send a report unless your  investigation is 
completed and his answer to me was, there was pressure on him from 
Advocate Mosing.  Now the same Mosing who was involved in my 
matter and the same Mosing who was involved in setting the stage to 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 64 of 170 
 
have the Amigos case withdrawn.  He said t here is pressure from 
Advocate Mosing to provide him with either the report or the docket I 
cannot recall.  But what – but then comes to light is unbeknown to me 
at the time that I wanted to fly to Cape Town I only established now 
later on why there is this animosity towards General Dramat from 
Ntlemeza’s side.  According to Khuba Ntlemeza put pressure on him to 
finalise the investigation.  And I do not want to quote from the 
statement but the words to the effect were used that if there might – if 
he experiences problems Richard Ndluli had told him via Ntlemeza now 
that he will look after him.  At some stage he even phoned Innocent 
10 
Khuba on his wife’s phone and he would come to Khuba’s house, 
Innocent Khuba’s house. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Before dealing with that 
particular phone call is the paragraph you referring to at page 296 
paragraph 5.11 of Exhibit Z[B]?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  296.  Paragraph? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  5.11 at the bottom. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  If you could just then 
read that – that particular paragraph into the record?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :   
“Again in October 2013 this is now the statement by 
Innocent Khuba Chair, my wife called me wh ile I was 
watching TV and informed me that Mlegazi referring 
to General Ntlemeza was at the gate.  She then 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 65 of 170 
 
handed me her phone and he requested me to order 
the security to open for him as he had valuable 
information to tell me.  When he was inside he said  
that he was – he has urgent information to tell.  He 
said on Friday he was at the airport and he met with 
Ndluli who requested him to tell me that I must not 
be afraid when dealing with rendition case because 
there were people who were looking after me.  He 
said he was asked by Mdluli to deploy people for my 
safety and that if I see any suspicious car behind me 
10 
I should call him.  I was surprised because I never 
met or spoke with Mdluli.  During my entire 
investigation 
with Colonel 
Mokunkwe 
he 
never 
mentioned Ndluli’s name.” 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that appears to be the 
excerpt that you were then referring to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair but if I can just 
conclude my summary of his statement.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The day that Dramat 
20 
was suspended I do not know whether they met or whether he had 
phoned Khuba but it is reflected in his statement Ntlemeza told him his 
day had now come to head the Hawks.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And on that point can I take you 
then to the particular paragraph you may be referring to which is 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 66 of 170 
 
paragraph 5.13 on page 297. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  5.13? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  5.13 just for accuracy on 
record.  Can you in fact if I may with your leave Chair just to place on 
record 5.13 states: 
“I only informed one of the IPID employees whom I 
trusted about what happened when General Ntlemeza 
visited me.  When I sent a report to Advocate Mosing 
General Ntlemeza stopped asking me abou t the 
report.  The last time I met with General Ntlemeza 
10 
was on 6.12.214 at Wimpy Cycad Centre I think.”  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Cycad Centre. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Cycad Centre.  That is for the 
record CYCAD. 
“He had just called me to  tell me the good news.  I 
arrived at approximately 15:00 with my wife but she 
remained in the car.  I found him seated inside.  He 
said that his time to move to the Hawks had arrived 
and that there was going to be a hit on Dramat.  He 
encouraged me to watch the news on TV in the next 
20 
coming weeks.  What he told me happened – what he 
told me happened exactly as he said.  His last 
communication with my wife was on 31.1. 2015 where 
he sent her a message at 16:06.”  
Is that the section that you were referring t o? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 67 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is what I am 
referring to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr McBride also said in his evidence that Mr 
Khuba had told him that General Ntlemeza had put pressure on him to 
finalise the report relating to the rendition matter.  And that he had also 
alerted him that something was going to happen to General Dramat on 
a certain day and it seems that something did happen and that is I think 
the suspension if I am not mistaken.  Yes thank you.  So it seems if this 
– if Mr Khuba’s evidence is correct it seems that General Ntlemeza 
knew in advance what was going to happen to General Dramat and that 
10 
he may have known or expected that he would be appointed if and when 
General Dramat was not there. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Chair that is how I 
interpret events.  Why would Ntlemeza who at the time was outside the 
Hawks put pressure on Mr Khuba to expedite his investigation?  And 
then from the National Prosecuting Authority side you have Advocate 
Mosing wanting reports before the investigation is finalised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So to me it is clear 
that there was a strategy from the National Prosecuting Authority side 
20 
and I here I will say from Mosing’s side I do not know at whose behest 
but from his – from the NPA’s side and from the police’s side Ntlemeza 
to get rid of General Dramat.  And the reason was simple Chair.  
General Dramat was the one the driving force put – on a – for a number 
of investigations. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 68 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Inter alia the Secret 
Services account, the looting and it was – it had become common 
cause before I returned to work that General Dramat was supporting me 
in my investigations.  Because he basically took my side when there 
was this disagreement between myself and General Phiyega.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – well we will see at the end of the whole 
commission findings will be made but there certainly are certain 
fissures of evidence that I am hearing from you that I heard from Mr 
McBride.  That should be quite concerning if it is true.  The Law 
10 
Enforcement is very important and if Law Enforcement is not doing its 
job properly then we have no country.  So – but I am hoping that more 
and more people within Law Enforcement who know what was 
happening will come forward and will not be scared, will come forward 
and give evidence and tell the nation exactly what has been happening 
because if the Law Enforcement Agencies are not working then we will 
not have a country.  We have got to find out exac tly what has been 
happening so that this commission can make recommendations as to 
what should be done to make sure that those things never happen 
again. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I agree the 
problem with that is and Mr McBride calls it th e Blue Curtain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair believe me if 
any person at whatever level becomes a whistle -blower I am talking 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 69 of 170 
 
about SAPS I am not talking about any other department.  You are dead 
in the water.  You are ostr acised, you are worked out.  They – in my 
instance you get prosecuted, you get suspended and despite of court 
hearings courts basically agreeing that there is no case against me, 
being exonerated they will not leave you alone.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not everybody can – can stand up to that for a 
long time. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is the one Chair 
10 
and the other thing is Chair the promotion system in the police in my 
view should be revised.  Because I know a number of officers they will 
not set a foot wrong or report something because they are scared that 
they will not be promoted.  Chair I have sat on those promotion – how 
to – in the past how it worked is you had to attain a certain 
qualification 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  You had to write an 
exam to become a sergeant.  You had to write an exam to become a 
warrant officer.  You had to write an exam to become a commissioned 
20 
officer and then attend a course t o become a lieutenant.  Then you had 
to attend every second year for every second rank you had to attend 
another course.  So currently how it works.  The – a post is advertised 
and whether you have the right attributes or qualifications Chair I sat 
on those panels at senior level where the – invariably the decisions are 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 70 of 170 
 
taken before any of the candidates appear.  It is a farce.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But who is going to get into that post?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair.  It is – the 
promotional system in SAPS is a complete farce.  In most of the panels 
that I sat and one of – I sat on some panels with at – for a very senior 
post with General Ncubeni and we would sit there and we independently 
have to mark candidates on various aspects and once the ca ndidate 
leaves the room she would ask each one of us.  Johan then I will say 4.  
Why do you give him 4?  Then I wills say well that is – and then – so 
what I eventually did Chair is if the candidate deserved a 6 I will give 
10 
him a 6.  If he deserved a 3 I w ill put a 3 there.  If she said to me, 
Johan then I listen what the rest say I will say no they all say a 6 I also 
say a 6.  But then I put my 3 there.  Because they decide before the 
time who is going to be promoted.  It is very rare that the candidate 
and Chair believe me it has got nothing to do with race.  I am not 
talking about whites and blacks here there are many, many black 
officers, good officers that are being overseeing because they do the 
right thing.  They worked with me.  I have sat on those p anels.  I talk of 
experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m.  Well if we are to make recommendations as to 
20 
what should be done in the future to avoid some of the problems that 
may be the Law Enforcement Agencies have found themselves in it 
would be important to have as much information as possible from 
people on the ground who know how these things work.  So people like 
you and other people and organisations that may be involved in Law 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 71 of 170 
 
Enforcement Agencies who wish to make recommendations as to what 
should be looked at in terms of recommendations who wish to make 
submissions you know in due course will you know will be allowed and 
they must be ready to make submissions as to what should be done.  Of 
course before you can make recommendations you – about what should 
be done you need to know what has happened and that is why we need 
to go through this so that the measures that must be taken must match 
what the problem was that is sought to be addressed.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair and I am saying 
that in the context of. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  People wanting to 
come forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  To expose the rot in 
the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And believe me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is – corruption is 
20 
rife in the police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I have been out of the 
police for two years but I still work with Law Enforcement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 72 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And I am not saying 
everyone Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
am 
levelling 
accusations against prosecutors here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And senior police 
officers but there are a number of prosecutors Chair that I still work 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That do a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A good job. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  An honest day’s job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And a number of 
policemen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
But 
unfortunately 
those people are at the mercy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Of people who are 
appointed above them who are doing the bidding of the people above 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No, no thanks.  I am also talking exactly from 
the same point.  So it is not just a question of addressing issues at 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 73 of 170 
 
SAPS that people might be concerned about that have got nothing to  do 
with the Commission.  It is to the extent that certain - a certain 
environment maybe providing a fertile ground for corruption within Law 
Enforcement Agencies.  So that – that needs to be looked at if we want 
to make sure that such corruption does not continue.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  General Booysen 
you touched on the issue in relation to Human Resources and the 
appointment of people within the police.  In your affidavit you talk 
specifically about Major-General Ntlemeza’s approach to promotions in 
particular.  Can you please explain the detail in relation to that?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair historically how 
the promotions work in provinces.  The provinces are – they deal with 
the promotions in their own p rovince.  For instance if a Captain’s post 
was advertised the short – the long listing will be done at provincial 
level.  The short listing will be done.  The interviews will – everything 
will be done at provincial level.  Then the recommendations go to 
national.  At national they will either sanction it or if they think that 
your equity profile might not be right they might take the number two 
candidate which is not a problem.  The problem started when 
General Ntlemeza became the Head of the Hawks.  He hij acked the 
20 
whole promotion system of the Hawks.  All the posts that were 
advertised within the Hawks were dealt with from his office.  He 
excluded the Provincial Heads – all of us.  At a meeting at Polokwane I 
took issue with that and I said to him we as Pr ovincial Heads – now I 
was talking on behalf of all the nine provinces because we discussed it 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 74 of 170 
 
amongst ourselves the Provincial Heads.  I said we as Provincial Heads 
we – we know the people in the provinces.  We know the dynamics of 
crime in the provinces.  In KZN for instance I know about faction fights 
– political killings.  I do not know about gangsterism that occur in Cape 
Town.  So I would know which – the profile of the person who needs to 
be appointed and then he basically made some excuse saying to me no 
well he will incorporate us in the – in the processes in the future which 
he never did but what he did in fact do - which I found very strange.  
He 
co-opted 
a 
police 
officer 
from 
KwaZulu-Natal 
Major-General Ngembe.  Now she was outside the Hawks.  Sh e was 
10 
from the SAPS side and she was at Human Resources in KwaZulu -Natal 
and he would take her all over the country to do interviews and 
appointments.  I bumped into her one day in the lift at KwaZulu -Natal 
and she said to me no she is – she has been co-opted by 
General Ntlemeza to do these appointments and she said to me it is – it 
is not her field and she does not know anything about investigations.  
Chair at KwaZulu-Natal for instance - I always say the person who 
carries the purse calls the shots.  So there where you – your HR is a 
very important component of – of a company or a unit.  In my instance 
for instance there was a Captain then she is a Colonel now – 
20 
Sonnekus.  She was the Support Head dealing with finances, dealing 
with appointments.  General Ntlemeza without any cause sent me a 
notice of an intention to suspend her for a very trivial matter which she 
was not even responsible for.  So I wrote back to him and I said to him 
this matter has been disposed of.  Discipline is a line management 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 75 of 170 
 
function.  I regard the matter as – as finalised.  A week after he 
suspended me he suspended her.  She sat at home for a full year.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So he disregarded your – what you had to say? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He suspended her.  
She sat at home for a full year.  She then – he then charged her in 
terms of the Disciplinary Code.  She asked me to come and give 
evidence which I did.  We raised a few points in limine and the matter 
was 
remanded 
and 
I 
told 
the 
Chairperson 
because 
what 
10 
General Ntlemeza would do is he would get his cohorts from other 
provinces.  General Sibiya calls them the “assassins”.  He would get 
them there and your fate is sealed with - with the type of disciplinari es 
that – that he concocted.  So I told the Chairperson there and I told the 
– the employer representative if they proceed with this matter it will 
probably be taken on review in the Labour Court and having given them 
the facts I will make sure that the taxpayer will not pay for that.  They 
will – they will pay the (indistinct).  They will pay from their own 
pockets and we never heard from them again.  Then a couple of months 
later she got a letter to go back to work.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did the disciplinary hearing proceed or not?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They abandoned it 
Chair and up until today I know she has been writing for a finding on 
the matter – up until today there has been no finding.  What they did is 
when they – when they saw that they could not take it further they told 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 76 of 170 
 
her to go back to work but then transferred her to another place.  I 
understand she has taken that matter to the SSSBC and as recent as 
about two or three months ago there was an agreement between the 
SSSBC – well between her and the police during the arbitration process 
that she would take up her original post but she – she had been out of 
that post for – for the better part of two years.  What I am trying to 
demonstrate Chair is the same thing happened at national lev el where 
there is a Brigadier Vermaak and Brigadier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – I am sorry.  Before you go to national you – 
you told – you wrote to General Ntlemeza and said the matter about 
10 
which you are contemplating suspending this person has been disposed  
of.  He did not respond to you but about five days or so later or a week 
later the person was suspended.  She stayed at home for about a year. 
There was a hearing – disciplinary hearing.  You took part or you 
indicated that if this matter was taken on rev iew you would make sure 
that General Ntlemeza – whoever you might have said – paid from his 
own pocket and then the matter was abandoned.  Is that more or less 
correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  More or less Chair.  
When – when I wrote to him that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Management – line 
management function has been disposed of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I did not hear from 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 77 of 170 
 
him again except about three weeks later.  I did not mention t his.  A 
Colonel arrived in my office from his office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And he said he is here 
to do an investigation.  I said what investigation.  He says no the – 
some files went missing out of another member’s car.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said to him who 
sent you.  He said no it is Ntlemeza.  Now that related to the thing that 
they wanted to suspend. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That person. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That person for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said to but it is 
finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I said how long are 
you here for.  He said to me no for three days.  So I still said to him 
listen here go and sit in your hotel room.  Buy yourself a barrel of 
Kentucky then you can have some Kentucky.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then go back and tell 
General Ntlemeza he must stop – stop poking his nose into my 
province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 78 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because Chair I was – 
I was getting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Tired of his antics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he left – then he 
left it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Then he suspended 
10 
me.  Ntlemeza suspended me and about a week.  
CHAIRPERSON:  For what now? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is (intervenes). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  For the fraud matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that you have discussed before?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And about a week 
after he suspended me he suspende d her as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That lady.  Was it a lady?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was a lady Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then the – the matter that was taken to 
arbitration related to her transfer.  The validity or fairness of her 
transfer.  Is that what was taken to arbitration?  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 79 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do you know whether the reasons for the 
transfer were in anyway connected with the reason for her suspension 
or was it something else ? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair all they want to 
do is they want to take control of key posts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She was unlawfully 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She went back to 
work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  After their hands were 
basically forced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because there were 
questions in Parliament of members sitting at home for more than a 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  On suspension.  So 
they were under pressure to let her go back to work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Now she goes back to 
work but they do not want her in that position.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 80 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So they transfer her 
to – to another position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Away from province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And it is that decision 
that she took to the SSSBC.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for the record what exactly does 
SSSBC stand for? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair that is – that is 
equivalent to – for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Bargaining Council? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Very similar to the 
CCMA but for Government Officials.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is a Bargaining Council. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could then take you to paragraph 
155 
of 
your 
statement? 
 
You 
talk 
about 
specifically 
Major-General Ntlemeza’s replacement of Provincial Heads.  Can you 
give clarity to that detail please?  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 81 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair when the Hawks 
were established General Dramat became the Head of the Hawks.  They 
advertised post for the Heads of Hawks in nine provinces.  Nine of us 
were appointed as Head of the Hawks.  When Ntlemeza came there – 
and most of them were I would say the majority if not all of them were 
capable people to lead the provinces from the Hawks’ side but then the 
Glenister Judgment came out and according to the Glenister Judgment 
the appointments had to be made by the Head of the Hawks.  Prior to 
the Glenister Judgment appointments had to be made by the National 
Commissioner.  So Ntlemeza used that as an excuse to readvertise all 
10 
– all nine of the posts and except for one.  I think it was General Ntinka 
who also on her own accord went to another – to another post later on 
but out of the nine provinces he appointed eight new people as Head of 
the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean except for one all were – all the others who 
had been there before him were not retained?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my case Chair what 
he did with me while – while I was suspended. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is when he 
advertised and I still had my matter pending at the SCA.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  While that matter was 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 82 of 170 
 
pending he appointed someone else in my post.  
CHAIRPERSON:  To act? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No permanently Chair 
as part of that advertisement group.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
So 
technically 
speaking that post I should – I was in that post until. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The court case was 
disposed of. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he did no wait for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He advertised the 
post and filled it with someone else.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and what - what happened after that?  I assume 
you did not just take that as that is?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair at that stage I 
had been in and out of court over a period of five or six years and I just 
20 
thought to myself if I have to – you had to pick your fights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had reached a point where you were quite 
exhausted in terms of all the fights you had to put up?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is so and Chair – 
I mean Chair every single matter that I took to court.  As I have said 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 83 of 170 
 
and I will – I will mention it later on in terms of the – the financial 
implications to the taxpayer.  Every single one I won but Chair litigating 
with – with the NPA and SAPS they use taxpayers money.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Myself and the Cato 
Manor guys we – we had to find funds to – to fight – to fight what was  
happening to us but at that stage besides being exhausted Chair you 
have to pick your fights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because if you – you 
10 
are fighting all over the show. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
you 
spread 
yourself so thin on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So some of these 
things I had to let go.  Other – other more important issues I pursued.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  This was close to the time that you were going 
to retire? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the person who was appointed is it still the same 
person who is still there now or you do not know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He is still there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you have anything to add to this 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 84 of 170 
 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
certain 
Brigadier  Ronel Vermaak 
and 
Colonel Lynn Deveshan?  If I am pronouncing that correctly.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
Brigadier Vermaak was the National Support Head at General Dramat’s 
office and Colonel Lynn Deveshan was one of her subordinates.  Chair 
at any meeting whether you are a woman or – the way he spoke to 
people.  Sometimes I would cringe.  He would shout at them.  He will 
make racial remarks.  He would be little people and Vermaak and 
Deveshan told me personally that they just could not handle it any 
longer.  I mean he would – if - and that was not only with the two of 
10 
them.  If he had found out that anyone had any contact with 
General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He would go berserk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
just 
could 
not 
understand why at one stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then eventually 
Brigadier Vermaak took a transfer and so did Colonel  Deveshan.  Also 
20 
very key posts because that was Human Resources and when 
General Lebeya was appointed I actually approached Vermaak and 
Deveshan and I said to them look we need to assist General  Lebeya to 
get the ship afloat again because I think General  Lebeya inherited a 
sinking ship because of – of what General Ntlemeza did to the Hawks 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 85 of 170 
 
and she said to me General there is no ways I can go back to that 
place.  If I see that place I am traumatised.  That is how he dealt with 
people.  Chair in my instance when he served my suspension notice on 
me they arrived – it was a public holiday.  I was not at home.  I 
received a call from my neighbour.  He said to me the riot police is at 
your house.  So I said what do you mean.  He says no they are jumping 
over the fences with guns and – so I phoned my – my domestic aid and 
I said to her Lindie what is going on.  She says too many police.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this while – while you were at work or what?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  That is 
10 
when Ntlemeza suspended me but now he had to give me the notice.  
So it was a public holiday.  Then I get a call from my lawyer – 
Carl Van Der Merwe.  He says to me he received a call they are looking 
for you.  I said well I am in Pietermaritzburg now.  The next moment he 
phones me he says no it is a public holiday.  He says to me no the 
security from his office phoned him now.  Chair now I actually have 
video material that – to show how they take the national interv ention 
unit people.  They actually – when they approach the lawyer ’s office 
they jump out of the vehicles with their guns.  They go into the foyer.  
The offices were closed and you can see they talk to the security.  They 
20 
went upstairs came back.  That jus t to serve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For what? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair that is – that 
was Ntlemeza at his best.  He – he wanted to prove a point if you go 
against me this is what is going to happen to you.  Even when I was 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 86 of 170 
 
suspended - eventually suspended he went to my office.  My secretary 
was sitting there and my door was locked and he said to them they 
must open and by the way Chair she – he took with her - just to prove 
the point he took with him General  Ngobeni the suspect in my 
investigation.  They went to my office and he threatened my secretary 
that she should open the door otherwise she will also be suspended.  
So it was very highhanded.  If you dared go against him whether you 
were right or wrong he – and I think he wanted to prove a point.   
Booysen went against me.  He sends these people to my house in 
battle gear to come and serve a notice on me.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say these people were – you were told were 
jumping over the fence or something?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well I was not there 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In your house. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  My neighbour phoned 
me.  He said to me the – the riot police is at your house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I phoned – phoned 
my domestic aid.  I said Lindie what is going on.  She says no there are 
20 
lots of policemen at the house.  They are coming from the sides and 
they have got big guns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And then I get the call 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 87 of 170 
 
from my attorney.  They are looking for me.  Then they go to my 
attorney’s office and that I have on – I have a little video clip of that.  
How they descended upon his office to come and serve a notice on me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The ones who were – who had gone to your house did 
you get to know what the – the purpose of their visit was?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They wanted to serve 
me with the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A notice of your suspension?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Suspension – that is 
correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So some went to – to your house.  Others went to 
your attorney’s office or it was the same group?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is the same group 
Chair.  When they could not find me at my house.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Then they went (intervenes). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  They went to my 
attorney’s office but I do not understand why they went to his office.  It 
was a public holiday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  There was no one 
20 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could ask you to turn to EXHIBIT 
Z(B) and in particular page 306?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me Major-General Booysen – I am sorry to 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 88 of 170 
 
interrupt you Ms September.  By this time you had been – you know – in 
the Law Enforcement Sector for decades.  Is that how notice of – 
notices of suspension are delivered or served on police officers when 
they need to be suspended?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Definitely not Chair.  I 
have – I have never – I have suspended officers before.  I call them to 
my office.  I tell them the reason for the suspension and I will give them 
the notice.  I let them sign for it and I treat them as human beings 
whether they are right or wrong.  I have never ever seen anything like 
it.  Chair can you just imagine what my neighbours must have thought 
10 
with the riot police descending upon my house.  My lawyer phoning me.  
There are policemen all over the show at this office and as I said I have 
a video clip that can prove that but no Chair.  That is – it is completely 
irregular to do that.  I posed no threat.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 306 you have an affidavit 
that has been deposed to by Ronel  Vermaak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry which exhibit are you now on?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  EXHIBIT Z(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 306.  Is it correct that this is an 
20 
affidavit deposed by Ronel Vermaak and the date of this particular 
affidavit is dated 8 February 2019 as reflected on page 313?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Have you read through this affidavit?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I have just 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 89 of 170 
 
perused through it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And does it ascribe the - or the same 
or similar manner of your dealings with Major -General Ntlemeza? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in particular the relationship 
between Ronel Vermaak and Major-General Ntlemeza? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is indeed so Chair.  
She goes into a bit of more detail here but – and I have picked up 
something here that I was not even aware of.  If I would go to National 
Head Office she was actually hiding in the offices.  She did not want to 
10 
be seen with me because. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Brigadier Vermaak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. She did not – she would not want to be seen with 
you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ja.  So I now realise 
when I went to Head Office I could never find her there . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because she was 
hiding from me because she was scared if Ntlemeza sees her with me 
20 
all hell with break loose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We are now on page 48 of your 
affidavit in particular from paragraph 157 which talks about the 
appointment of the Head of the Hawks.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 90 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did he not cover this last time or is there 
something to be covered?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No Chair.  This is something new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I seem to remember Major-General Booysen 
talking about him and other people going to Cape Town for an interview 
but General Ntlemeza not being among them and to his – how he was 
taken to the Gupta residence.  Major-General Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
No, 
I 
have 
not 
testified about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No.  I have not 
testified about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the second part? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Also the interview? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Not 
the 
Gupta 
interview.  I have not testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but the other one you did about the interview?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Okay, thank you or maybe it is just I 
read and you have not testified, okay.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair he certainly did allude to 
certain aspects of his application for the position.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 91 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Continue and cover what you need to 
cover. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
General Booysen 
do you know 
Mr Duduzane Zuma? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How do you know him? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I cannot recall 
the date.  It was when I was back at work.  A person – I cannot recall 
what his name is.  I will – maybe if we break I will get his name.  Phone 
me and he wanted to meet me and I met with him and he told me that 
10 
he was a friend and a partner of Duduzane  Zuma and then he said to 
me that there is a complaint they want to lodge with regards to a 
criminal investigation against the White guy.  I think his surname was 
Erlang but I can get his surname Chair.  The way he explained it  to me 
is that Duduzane did not want to go into business with this White male 
but he convinced Duduzane to go into business with this White male 
and it is related to online betting and apparently this White male had 
then defrauded them with millions and th is guy was now sitting in - in 
the UK.  He then said to me that this White male - the Hawks from Cape 
Town had mirror imaged this White male’s computer in Durban.  I said 
20 
no I do not believe it because I would have been aware of that.  So I 
thought 
let 
me 
just 
take 
– 
take 
a 
chance. 
So 
I 
phoned 
Colonel Rudolfse.  I said to him Cobus are you aware.  He said no he 
knows about it.  They did mirror image this White male’s computer and 
there is an investigation by the British Police regarding this online 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 92 of 170 
 
betting thing.  Be that as it may Chair so the complaint from their side 
was that we should investigate – it was a couple of million Rand. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And whose side when you say his 
side do you mean? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Sorry. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who – who was the complainant in 
the matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
The 
complainant 
would have been - Chair I will have to get his name.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the name that you cannot remember at the 
10 
moment? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  But I will get it now 
Chair when we get a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So he said they want 
to – to do – us to do the criminal investigation and Chair I was very 
weary.  I do not want to do criminal in vestigations from - because we 
met at a restaurant.  So I pointed a Lieutenant-Colonel Marthinus. His 
nickname is Tienie Botha to open up an inquiry and a docket to 
investigate the matter.  So I said okay we will investigate the matter.  
20 
Subsequent to that he wanted to see me again and we met in a 
restaurant in Florida Road. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let us just go back.  What was the actual 
complaint that had to be investigated about the online business?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it was one of 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 93 of 170 
 
these technical things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Online betting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Some technical things, ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I am not very au fait 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
These 
commercial 
investigations Chair but the complaint at face value appeared to be 
legitimate and Colonel Botha also reported back to me that there 
10 
appears to have been crime committed by this White gentleman who is 
now in England.  At a second mee ting this time around I met this 
gentleman whose name I cannot recall and Duduzane came and there 
was another tall Coloured male with – with them.  The coloured male 
recognised me but I did not recognise him and – but the way he spoke 
to me it’s like we knew each other and eventually I picked up that he 
was a person by the name of Lloyd Hill and Lloyd Hill Chair, if I can 
just digress a little bit there was a allegation against a previous 
president of that gangsters that were – that they met up with and very 
foul language were used, now this was the same Lloyd Hill was at that 
20 
meeting with the president.  So this Lloyd Hill – I remembered him 
when I was a young Lieutenant, he used to work and went – he was 
involved with narcotics.  So then I realised who thi s guy was because 
he had got much older and we spoke about the investigation, myself 
and Duduzane and I told him, look Colonel Botha is dealing with the 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 94 of 170 
 
matter.  I don’t think they tried to put pressure on me, I think – 
nowadays the public has to put press ure on the police to do their work.   
 
Then on an occasion I was in Gauteng and I received a call 
from a Captain, Captain Dirk Swart, now Captain Dirk Swart happens to 
be friends with Edward Zuma and Duduzane Zuma and he said to me 
Duduzane would like to meet me here in Pretoria because they knew 
that I was here.  So I said to him its fine so I drove with my son, my 
son Eben and we met them in Sandton but when I met them Duduzane 
was with a youngster, more or less his age, a white guy.  So we just 
spoke in generalarities and we were in my son’s car so they said, no we 
10 
should go to their office.  So we drove to a office and I think I’ll be able 
to find it in Sandton and we went inside, we saw people there I don’t 
know who they were.  Thinking back I suspect i t could have been the 
offices of the Guptas because the boardroom sat in had a big plastic 
thing with a piece of pole inside but we just had tea and we spoke to 
this – my son spoke to this young white lighty but they were friends 
Duduzane and this youngster, they were in the same school and 
Duduzane spoke about that they were still expanding their business to 
make armoured vehicles and next time when I’m here they’ll take me in 
the helicopter and we’ll go and have a look at the place where they 
20 
build the armoured vehicles, I still said it would be nice and then we 
left.  Then on a second occasion, I think I’ve got the date in my 
statement...(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes in fact if I could take you to 
paragraph 158, it’s understood that there  was, in fact a meeting shortly 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 95 of 170 
 
before your interview. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair, so I was 
shortlisted to become the head of the Hawks Nationally and our 
interviews, I think, was – well the date on which I saw him – Duduzane 
was the 16 t h, I think the interviews were two or three days 
after...(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that’s the 16 t h of August 2015. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   August 2015. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I once again got a 
10 
call from Captain Dirk Swart who said to me – he calls him Zane would 
like to see me again.  So I said to him okay where is he, he said no 
he’s in Sandton.  So I said to him okay – Chair I just want to interrupt 
myself there, prior to that, I also got a call from Dirk Swart who said 
that Zane wanted to see me, I was on my way to hospital a little 
company of Mary Hospital in Pretoria where my brother’s son had a 
brain operation.  So I said well I’m on my way to the hospital, then he 
said, no he’ll meet me at the hospital and I arrived there with my whole 
family, children, wife and he arrived there, that’s now Duduzane in a 
Mercedes Benz, one of these fancy cars.  He’s a very likeable person 
20 
and he spoke to me almost like – and he calls me sir and by then he’d 
already met Eben my son and they would – and just like a greeting, 
meet and greet type of thing and then he left with the Mercedes and I 
went into the hospital.  Back to this meeting in August Chair, so I 
said...(intervention). 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 96 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Just to make sure I understand, the meeting that you 
had with Mr Duduzane Zuma and his friend, you said it was about two 
or three days before you were to be interviewed for the position of head 
of Hawks? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No, no Chair this one 
I’m talking now...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one you’re about to talk about is that one?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   He was alone then. 
CHAIERPERSON:   Oh okay, the one where he was with his friend, 
roundabout – when was that more or less, was that the first one?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was the first one 
when I met him with his white friend Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that was the first one and it happened – it was 
in Gauteng.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In Sandton. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In Sandton ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   the second one was 
in Pretoria when he came there to the...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh to the hospital. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the first one – let’s finish the first one, what 
appeared to be the purpose of him wanting to meet with you?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I don’t know, 
like I say he’s a very jovial, friendly person, I think maybe he want ed to 
brag a little bit I don’t know, showing me the offices, the nice car.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 97 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it – I mean if you phone your friend and say 
let’s meet, there might not need to be any particular purpose, friends 
just want to be together for whatever but  if it’s somebody that you have 
never met before, one would think that there would be a purpose why 
you want to see that person. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair as I said during 
that first meeting with him and that white youngster we went to th ose 
offices and nothing much was said although he spoke about the 
investigation that we were busy with but I just said to him look – 
because they were pressurising – not so much him, it was done by the 
10 
other chap whose name I’ve forgotten now.  They were p utting pressure 
on myself and the investigating officer, Colonel Botha and I explained 
to them, we cannot just go and access documents we have to subpoena 
the documents and then when I met him – but when I met him here in 
Pretoria, when I met Zane in Preto ria I don’t think the idea was for me 
– for him – for me to give feedback about the investigation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Because we discussed 
it but it wasn’t the primary cause of it  - it was – the discussion on the 
case was, we’re busy with it, Colonel Botha is dealing with it.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay thank you, then you’re onto the third – and 
then the second encounter, it seems from what you have said that the 
purpose was not clear either, you were going to hospital, h e came 
(indistinct) and much not much was discussed and then he left.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
And 
with 
that 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 98 of 170 
 
discussion just about my whole family that was there, we stood there in 
the car park, we spoke about the weather and the nice car and he said 
he had to go and I also said I also had to go now because we have to 
go see my brother ’s son. 
CHAIERPERSON:   Yes okay and then now you are into the third one 
and that the one, two or three days before the interview.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair I received a 
call again that he would like to see me, I said where, Sandton again, 
10 
where in Sandton, I can’t recall exactly where so I said once agai n to 
my son Eben to a accompany me and we drove in his car.  Now on the 
way there we put the phone on speaker phone and then I received a 
call on the speaker phone which Eben could hear and asked where we 
were – well he said we are here, I said we are on o ur way, we should 
be there in a few minutes and then we terminated the call and then my 
son said to me who’s that now but because Zane speaks very private 
school English and – but...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is private school English General Booys en, I’m 
sure it’s not like my English. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And like my English 
Chair.  Then my son said to me, “wie is dit”, - who is that, so I said to 
him I think it’s his white friend talking because of the way he spoke 
English and we eventually go the place where we were supposed to 
meet and then...(intervention). 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 99 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON: But why did you say that was it to test whether your 
son could distinguish who was speaking based on English or what?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair I was 
confused too then because I thought maybe – because the first time we 
met the white youngster was with so I thought maybe this time again, 
the white youngster is with because it sounded like a white person 
speaking, the English he spoke. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   And then when I 
eventually arrived in Sandton at the spot where we were supposed to 
10 
meet they weren’t there or he wasn’t there.  I phoned him and we kept 
on missing each other and eventually I said to him listen I’m hungry 
now, there’s a burger place around the corner by the Gautrain Station.  
So I said to him, listen let’s go have a bite quickly we went and as I 
ordered he phoned again and I said, no we’re just having a bite and 
this time around he said, meet me at the Gautrain station at a specific 
place around the corner.  We finished the hamburgers and my son 
parked his vehicle, so I thought let me get out of the vehicle so that 
they can see me...(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Before 
you 
continue 
General 
20 
Booysen with there not being any specific purpose for your previous 
meetings why were you inclined to meet with him again?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair as I said in the 
beginning of my evidence, if you know Duduzane, he’s one of those – 
like he could be your son plus we were doing that investigation in which 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 100 of 170 
 
he was a complainant or a co -complainant with this other gentleman so 
I didn’t see anything untoward in meeting him at that stage.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes continue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair I got out of 
the vehicle and I stood on the pavement so that if they come they can 
now see me because we kept on missing each other and the next 
moment – Eben was still in the car, the next moment I saw a black lady 
coming 
from 
the 
opposite 
direction 
with 
her 
child 
and 
I 
saw...(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   A black sorry? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   A  black lady coming 
from this side with her small child and then the next moment from this 
side I saw a Rolls Royce a black Rolls Royce pulling up behind Eben’s 
car, my son’s car.  I thought this car is stopping to pick up this lady but 
this lady kept on walking, so I thought okay and I bent inside the car 
and I said to my son, look at this car behind us because not every day 
that you see a Rolls Royce and then when I looked I saw no there’s 
Duduzane sitting in the car and what I forgot to say Chair, when we 
were still in the car finding each other, he said to me are you going to  
20 
jump in the car with me, I said, no I’ll follow you.  Then when I saw it 
was  him I went to him and I greeted him, then I decided no it’s better 
to drive in the Rolls Royce that my son’s Corolla.   
 
So I went to my son, I said, no I’m going to drive with him.  So 
I jumped in the Rolls Royce and Eben, my son followed us in the Toyota 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 101 of 170 
 
and we went in the direction where the offices were but then we went 
past and I recall during that week there was some comments in the 
media about the then President again and I said to him, hey your old 
man is having a hard time and he said yes and we spoke about the hard 
time the old man is having and we carried on driving and the next 
moment I saw we were close to the zoo and then right next to the zoo 
we drove – we pulled up to the gates and I saw these huge gates which 
I’d seen before in the media and the gates opened.  There was a lot of 
activity of security detail, we drove in, my son drove in with us, I 
alighted from the vehicle so did Duduzane and my son came up to me 
10 
and he said to me in Afrikaans, “Dadda is ek waar ek dink ons is, Dad 
are we where I think we are”, I said to him, I think so.  We then went to 
the staircase, Eben was with us, the door was opened, there’s a foyer 
as you enter the door and we were asked for our phones, we handed 
our phones over and we went into a lounge area where I was introduced 
to Tony Gupta, well he introduced himself as Tony Gupta.  Chair the 
initial talk were – first they spoke to Eben.  What do you do Eben, Eben 
said, no I’m in the IT industry and they then said to him, well if you 
have any business proposals don’t hesitate to contact us and spoke 
about the weather and the importance of schooling and he ordered 
20 
some snacks.  The people that served us with the snacks – Chair I’m 
from KwaZulu Natal I know Indian accent and I’ve been to India, I know 
how the Indians in KZN talk and I know how the Indians in India talk, 
these people definitely also from India, the people that were bringing 
the snacks and they gave us some snacks and some stu ff to drink and 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 102 of 170 
 
then at some point – and this is where things turned funny he, that’s 
now Mr Gupta, raised the issue about me being shortlisted to become 
the head of the Hawks. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who was all in the room at that 
particular point in time? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It was myself, Eben 
and Duduzane and Tony Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in which part of the house were you when this 
was raised now? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair you walk 
10 
upstairs and then there’s  this huge door then there’s like an entrance 
area and then it goes into a – it’s a huge lounge a very posh lounge.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay so it was a lounge?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It was a lounge 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes, so he raised this issue. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair, so I 
said...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did he say exactly?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So he said to me, so 
20 
I understand you might become the head of the Hawks.  Chair very few 
people knew that I’d been shortlisted for the post although there was a 
newspaper article in KwaZulu Natal, I think it was in the Mercury, that 
said Booysen’s going for Dramat’s job or something – words to that 
effect but over and above that it was not  generally known that I’d been 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 103 of 170 
 
shortlisted for that post and I said to him, ja it’s true and he said to me 
but if you do get appointed that we should have a supper in KwaZulu 
Natal.  I did not know what to make of that, if I get appointed we should 
have supper in KwaZulu Natal, so I just smiled at him and nodded my 
head, I didn’t respond because I was – it was a bit of an uncomfortable 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because on the face of it, it looks like his 
interest in having supper with you in KwaZulu Na tal would depend on 
whether you were appointed as head of Hawks or not, if he says, if you 
get appointed let’s have supper in KwaZulu Natal.  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   One would have thought that he would be interested 
in having supper with you irrespective of your appointment – the 
outcome of your interview. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair the impression 
I gained, he said to me, if I’m appointed then we should have supper in 
KZN. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that’s what I’m saying that it seems strange that 
he would want to – or anybody outside of the Hawks anybody outside of 
the Law Enforcement Agency should only seek to have a meeting with 
20 
you or supper with you, if you are appointed.  You know, I mean, if you 
meet people sometimes you feel like, you know, you like these people 
maybe you’d like to have tea or coffee or lunch with them some other 
time, you don’t make that to depend on anything you just say, maybe 
we should have tea or lunch some other time.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 104 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I’m just saying it – on the face of it, it looks quite 
strange that, that was to depend on that.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair.  Chair not 
anything else was discussed about myself be ing appointed or not 
appointed. Zane did not take part in the conversation whatsoever, it 
was a short discussion, it continued where I think my son liked the 
juice that they were making, he had a second cup of the juice and we 
decided – well not decided it was clear that we had said what had to be 
said and I then departed but no promises were made, no undertakings 
10 
were given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No pressure of any sort was put on you to do 
anything or not to do anything?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: Nothing, no Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But again let’s go back to – as you left the meeting 
were you clear as to what the purpose of the meeting was that – of the 
meeting was, what was the purpose of this meeting?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I suspect that 
what he was trying to tell me is that should I be appointed – although 
he did not say that, is that, he probably would have had a hand in my 
20 
appointment and that I might then have been indebted to him, although 
it was never said those were my conc lusions that I made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the person who had asked for the meeting wasn’t 
Tony – it wasn’t Mr Tony Gupta it was Mr Duduzane Zuma, isn’t it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 105 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But am I right in understanding your evidence to be 
that he asked for a meeting?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   You’re 100% correct 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I did not initiate the 
meeting, they phoned me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so there were now – you had, had three 
meetings so to speak, some of them might not have lasted, you know, a 
long time but each one didn’t appear to be clear what the purpose was 
10 
am I right? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   You’re right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Although 
the 
investigation that they were the complainant in was discussed but that 
never seemed to be the...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   The reason for the meeting. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in the second meeting even the investigation 
wasn’t mentioned it was only the first and the third meeting.  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes the one at the 
hospital...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it was just greeting and...(intervention). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay thank you. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 106 of 170 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Following this encounter did you 
have any engagement with Duduzane Zuma again?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
After 
this 
engagement? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes I did Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Was there any discussion in relation 
to this meeting that you had at the Gupta residence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At the time that you had this meeting 
10 
or any time before, for the sake of clarity, were you involved in any 
investigations in relation to the Gupta family?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay what did you do after having 
this meeting with Mr Tony Gupta, did you take any steps after you had 
the meeting – after you had this meeting on the 16 t h of August 2015? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair okay, obviously 
I went home afterwards with my son Eben.  At that point in time it had 
become abundantly clear to me that Ntlemeza was not someone to be 
trusted.  I had to report to him and I was definitely not going to report 
20 
such a thing to him.  In the meantime what had ha ppened is, the lobby 
groups had brought in an application to set aside appointment of 
General Ntlemeza for not being fit and proper, because of a ruling, I 
think it was Judge Elias Mohtiyane in the Sibiya matter where he said 
that he had lied under oath an d that he lacks integrity.  The Court ruled 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 107 of 170 
 
in their favour, it was appealed it went to the SCA where General 
Ntlemeza basically lost his case and I think I’ve written the date 
somewhere in my statement Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That would be page 50 paragraph 
1.6.6 where you say on the 13 t h of June 2017...(intervention). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s correct Chair 
on the 13 t h of June 2017 at half past three the afternoon I prepared a 
statement about this meeting that I had at the Gup ta compound and on 
that particular day the judgment came out that Ntlemeza was finally to 
be removed from the Hawks.  The acting head of the Hawks then was 
10 
General Matakata, Yoli Matakata and I phoned her and I said to her I 
would like to meet her.  I left my office in Centurion and she left 
Pretoria, she was on her way to the airport...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON: I’m sorry I just want to make sure I follow.  Pending 
his appeal or petition to the Supreme Court of Appeal, General 
Ntlemeza was he on suspension or was he at work? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No he was at work 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was at work oh, when you talk about somebody 
acting in his position you mean after he had been removed?  
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So Chair when the 
SCA confirmed that he had to be removed, he had no more recourse 
and so – there were a few developments there where the minister 
actually had to go and physically boot him out of his office and he left 
with a car, that was all in the media.    
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 108 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was a different Minister...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That was Minister 
Fikile Mbalula. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair I prepared a 
statement as to what – about the meeting, I met General Matakata at – 
what’s that place called, at McDonalds...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I’m sorry Major General Booysen, maybe we 
should adjourn now, then when we come back you can then tell us.  I 
see it is about one minute past one, okay we’ll take the lunch 
10 
adjournment and we’ll resume at two.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you let us proceed. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Before the 
long adjournment General Booysen you were talking about the meeting 
that you had at the Gupta compound and that subse…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry Ms September.  Thank you.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  And then you 
spoke about that on the 13 June 2017 you had handed an affidavit to 
20 
Major General Matakata and that is at paragraph 166 of your affidavit.  
Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is there anything that you 
would like to add? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 109 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair… 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In relation to that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Just on that point.  I 
am not casting any aspersions on General Matakata.  I merely handed 
her the document.  I am not aware what transpired afterwards.  She 
may or may have not so I do not want it to be read that I am casting 
aspersions on her because she is an ex colleague of mine with whom I 
had had a healthy relationship and I still have a healthy relationship 
with her.  So for purposes of my evidence I just want to clea r that up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would she have been the one who would act on 
10 
the – on your complaint as I understand it.  Your affidavit was a 
complaint against General Ntlemza is that right or not really?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No not really Chair it 
was more – I wanted to bring it to – because at that juncture there were 
these allegations about the Gupta’s and state capture.  So…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I just thought it would 
be prudent for me to bring that to h er attention that I had met with the 
Gupta’s myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh so the affidavit that you handed to Major 
20 
General Matakata was to bring to her attention as the acting head of 
the Hawks that you had met with the Gupta’s?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And nothing else really?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And nothing else 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 110 of 170 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen are you aware 
as to whether or not any – anything happened after handing in the 
affidavit? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I am not aware of 
anything pursuant to my affidavit Chair but there may or may not have 
been steps taken up I am not privy to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course if they did  not think there was anything 
wrong with you having met with the Gupta’s they would not have to do 
10 
anything about it, is that right?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If you could then go back to 
Major General Ntlemeza it is on page 53 of your affidavit and paragraph 
177 that you make the following statement and that is that he was 
undoubtedly handpicked for the position.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which paragraph is 
that? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry it is paragraph 177. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can you please explain that?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry 13? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Apologies Chair it is page 53 
paragraph 177. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 111 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Thank you. 
MAJOR 
GENERAL JOHAN 
WESSEL 
BOOYSEN : 
 Chair 
I 
will 
substantiate my assertion there.  In the period that I worked with 
General Ntlemeza he did not demonstrate to me that he had remotely 
the ability to lead an important institutio n like the Hawks.  Secondly the 
mere fact that a judge in the high court had found him to be dishonest, 
lacking integrity and in spite of that Minister Nhleko still appoints him.  
I think the rest of what emerged after his appointment, his interference 
in a number of investigations clearly indicates to me he was appointed 
for a specific reason.  That is the only – that is the only unescapable 
10 
conclusion that I can come to. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And what reason was that?  You 
say that he was appointed to that position for a very particular reason?  
What reason are you alluding to?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Well Chair well to – to 
interfere with investigations such as the meeting with General Ngobeni.  
Such as interfering with Colonel Roelofse in that investigation.  The 
fact that I report – I personally reported corruption to him and he did 
absolutely nothing about it.  To me it is abundantly clear that there 
were certain matters that he had to deal with.  
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Was he involved in the Panday 
case at all? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Indirectly Chair 
because General Ngobeni was part of the Panday investigation.  So in 
meeting her I would suggest that in a way indirectly he interfered with 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 112 of 170 
 
that investigation. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Are you then suggesting and 
please correct me if I am wrong are you suggesting that he protected 
any particular interests?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes I do Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And whose interests migh t that 
have been? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair if one goes back 
into the history when General Dramat was the head of the Hawks he 
personally – he actively pursued the investigations against Richard 
10 
Mdluli.  He backed me in my investigations.  After he was – after he left 
the service there were rumours in the media that he had approached 
General Menu for the Nkandla docket.  A while later while I was in Cape 
Town when I launched my book he actually came to the launch and the 
day after we had coffee and I thought I want to verify that with him 
personally.  And I asked him, did you ask for the Nkandla docket and he 
said to me yes he did.  So my conclusion is that they had to get rid of 
Dramat because he was looking at the Mdluli’s of the day, he w as 
backing Booysen in the Panday investigation and various other 
investigations.  He placed him with some unpliable like Ntlemeza and 
20 
all of a sudden all those investigations basically became dormant 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  If we can then move onto the 
next individual that you mentioned in…  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 113 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms September before you move on I see that at 
page 51 there is mention of Zikhali and I wonder whether that is the 
person that may have been appointed to your position.  Can you cover 
that and I see there is reference to Lieutenant Colonel Sonnekus, Adele 
Sonnekus and maybe that is the lady that – that was transferred – 
suspended and transferred. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us cover that? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  I may have been mistaken I 
thought that the evidence in relation to Sonnekus was already covered 
but I am happy to do so again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we did not have the name if I recall correctly or 
did I misunderstand? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No, no Chair we had 
her name I think the name I had forgotten was the person that 
introduced me to Duduzane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  And as we adjourned 
20 
as I got up I realised the name it is Winston Innes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay that is the name that we did not have.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay no then I must hav e – but Zikhali? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair that is the 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 114 of 170 
 
person that Ntlemeza appointed to take over from me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is important to …  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not hear that part. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair when he 
appointed Zikhali after – while I was actually still in the post.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  It became evident to 
10 
me from reports from KwaZulu Natal because I still communicate with 
the Hawks frequently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That things that 
Ntlemeza placed in motion he continued with that.  For instance the 
removal of Colonel Sonnekus from her post.  In spite of the fact that 
they knew that it was unlawful they were steadfast and resolute and not 
and he was the leader, he was driving the bus at the time and not 
allowing her to go back to her post.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Zikhali. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Zikhali he was – he was leading the attempts to 
remove Sonnekus? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  By then – when he 
was appointed Chair she had already been removed.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 115 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN W ESSEL BOOYSEN:  But when she came 
back…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She was transferred 
and he is the one who told her that she is being transferred.  So it is 
clear to me he was still doing the bidding of what Ntlemeza had set in 
motion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  Much of the 
10 
other evidence has already been covered.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay okay.  I will let you know if I pick up something 
that I do not remember.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  I welcome your direction Chair.  
The next individual is reflected on page 55 of your affidavit and that is 
paragraph 184.  The person marked is Riah Phiyega.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think he – I think he must – he must deal 
with paragraph 171 I kn ow he has dealt with it in a certain way but I 
think it is quite an important thing and I think some of these that come 
there I think in that paragraph and the subsequent – and some of the 
20 
paragraph that come after that he seems to indicate specific 
appointments and there seems to be significance that he attaches to 
those appointments and I think it is important that we hear what he has 
to – the evidence ja 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem.  If I could then 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 116 of 170 
 
take you to paragraph 171 on page 52.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am there. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And ask you to please explain 
that to the Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there was – the 
Hawks when we inherited the Scorpions we also inherited they had 
chartered accountants working with them.  So in KZN we had a 
Brigadier Vleck who was the chartered accountant which is very 
necessary 
in 
investigating 
these 
complicated 
financial 
matters.  
Ntlemeza made Vleck’s life a living hell.  He basically forced him out he 
10 
eventually resigned.  So  as we speak there is no chartered accountant 
working with the Hawks in KZN as far as I am aware.  He had appointed 
people at provincial level and if you look at the – and the appointments 
are people that I would regard as incompetent Chair I deal with the m 
and I know some of them.  Well incompetent in that particular field.  
They might be competent in the uniform branch.  Some of the senior 
people that he appointed comes from the uniform branch.  They do not 
have any investigative experience.  So it cascad ed down to all the 
levels.  So from provincial level to provincial commander level they 
would then start as posts became available to – and Chair during – 
20 
while I was still there there was actually a standing joke amongst the 
provincial heads the majority of the people that he appointed either 
came from the Eastern Cape where he comes from originally or from 
Limpopo where he – where he had been for the latter part of his career.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 117 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair and there was 
once a technical section there which was basically closed down that 
dealt with the downloading of cell phones and analysis of cell phones.  
So in general Chair I can say that a number if not the vast majority of 
highly skilled detectives are either now back i n SAPS with the general 
detectives.  Some resigned and some left through natural attrition.  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it also correct that Major 
General Ntlemeza replaced Major General Motsepe as the national 
head of commercial crime with Major Gen eral Alfred Khana? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair what happened 
10 
there is when…  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is that correct? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Please proceed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair what happened 
there is when the previous national head of commercial crime General 
Hans Meiring went on retirement General Dramat appointed General 
Motsepe into the position has head of commercial crime.  And I know 
General Motsepe is a very capable competent person who can handle 
that post.  But when Ntlemeza assumed office he transferred Motsepe 
20 
and created a vacancy and the post was advertised and the person that 
he then appointed in that post is a person by the name of General 
Alfred Khana.  Now Khana’s history Chair he was the provincial 
commander from commercial crime in a couple of year previously.  And 
according to General Hans Meiring he had been busy with an 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 118 of 170 
 
investigation against General Khana relating to counte rfeit goods.  And 
it appears that Khana realised the writing was on the wall and he 
resigned.  He then went to another government department I cannot 
recall which one it was but nevertheless he landed up back with the 
Hawks being the head of commercial cri me.  And while I am there Chair 
a couple of months ago I received a call from a Captain in East London 
I do not know him at all.  It is a black gentleman.  He met me here on 
the – next to the road and he handed me a pile of documents and he 
complained to me that General Khana was interfering with an 
investigation into multi-million rand corruption which involves the 
10 
Minister Dlamini.   I took possession of those documents. I phoned 
Brigadier Bassie from the Hawks head office.  I met him the following 
day at the Wimpy in – at Attebury where I explained to him what had 
occurred and I handed him those documents.  There are also other 
indications Chair I have been phoned by and I would not like to mention 
this person because then they might ostracise him.  It is  a very 
experienced investigating officer in KwaZulu Natal.  He was dealing 
with an investigation of appointments or applications for a medical 
school in KwaZulu Natal University which also related to certain corrupt 
activities.  And he also complained to me that General Khana had been 
20 
interfering into that investigation.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Unless there is anything else in 
relation to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you can continue. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 119 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  So the next 
individual is Riah Phiyega.  Much detail is contained in your affidavit in 
relation to it but I ask you just – excuse me.  General Booysen to the 
extent that we have not dealt with any particular paragraph in – under 
Major General Ntlemeza do you confirm it to be correct?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  In relation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought at the beginning he confirmed 
everything in his affidavit to be correct but we have got to – we have 
got to cover important things because evidence relating to Law 
10 
Enforcement Agencies is very important and if the evidence that Major 
General Booysen is giving is true there are really very serious things 
that have been happening that should not have happene d.  It is very 
important that we deal with – with these issues properly.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We do not have to deal with every detail but 
we must cover important things. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  General 
Booysen what was the difference in approach or rather let me put it to – 
ask you it – ask you differently.  Was Riah Phiyega involved in both the 
20 
Cato Manor matter and the Mdluli matter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I would not say the 
Cato Manor matter but definitely the Booysen matter and the Mdluli 
matter. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And when you mean Booysen 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 120 of 170 
 
matter can you just clarify that please?  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is his matter. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to – you will not find out what role she 
played, is that what you want?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact – my question is slightly 
different and that is can you please explain what is the difference in 
approach that Riah Phiyega a dopted to your matter as compared to the 
Mdluli matter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the point I want 
10 
to make here is if you [indistinct] deposes her approach re Mdluli and 
re Booysen they were vastly different.  In the Mdluli matter you have  a 
high court judge, Judge Murphy who criticised General Phiyega for 
almost wanting Ndluli to come back to work in spite of very serious 
allegations hanging over his head.  Excuse me Chair.  In my matter in 
spite of the court having ruled that there is no case against me in a 
review application in spite of a person that she had appointed Advocate 
Naseer Cassiem to do a hearing on me who exonerated me she was 
bent – she was hell bent on getting rid of me. She offered me those 
three options which I testified about later.  Chair what – what I have 
20 
forgotten to mention is and I – when I went back to work I received and 
I went back in September and that December I received a notice from 
her that I should indicate to her why I should not be dismissed from the 
police.  It did not make sense to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Out of the blue? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 121 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Out of the blue Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had been to court.  You had been vindicated.  
Then you were told about three options but subsequently you got 
correspondence saying you must say why you should not be dismissed.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what reason was offered as to why your dismissal 
was being contemplated?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair she quoted a 
section in the police regulations which basically were designed if posts 
became I am looking for the correct word now.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Redundant. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Redundant that is 
right thank you Chair.  If a post becomes redundant then you can be 
relieved of your duties and they will then pay you out for the remainder 
of your contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that would be if nobody is going to continue to do 
the job that you were doing I would assume?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I think she… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your position was not redundant was it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No it was not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the letter you received from her was  along those 
lines? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Along those lines 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 122 of 170 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was saying your post has become redundant and 
you must say why you should not be discharged or dismissed bla, bla, 
bla. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  She did not go into 
those details she just mentioned the regulations Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  But the gist of the letter was that it was 
asking for your representations as to why  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I should not be 
dismissed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should not be dismissed. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Now Chair that to me 
did not make sense at all.  On the one hand you have someone like 
Richard Mdluli who has serious charges of fraud, corruption, murder, 
kidnapping hanging over his head.  The courts have pronounced on that 
and she is still actively attempts to get him back to the office by making 
an – or deposing to an affidavit in the Mdluli matter in the high court 
and the judge actually criticised her for that.  And in my mat ter in spite 
of being the courts having found in my favour and the disciplinary 
officer I refused to take any of the three options, I go back to work and 
20 
in that December I think she gave me two weeks to say why I should 
not be dismissed from the police and the two weeks expired I think on 
the 23 December and Chair I know how they operate.  I knew what was 
going to happen.  No matter what I say on the 23 r d when the time 
expires I would have gotten a letter like General Sibiya had gotten that 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 123 of 170 
 
I am dismissed and the same thing happened to Shadrack Sibiya and it 
takes you forever and a day by the time I would have won my cases to 
get back to office I would have retired in any event.  So I wrote a letter 
back to her I gave her two days to withdraw that letter or  else I will 
seek relief from the court.  And then I think it was around about the 20 t h 
a day or two before the date expired I received a letter from her office 
not signed by her stating from one of her officers that the general or 
the commissioner is not available to articulate her response and then I 
realised they were leading me into a trap because I knew what was 
going to happen on the 23 r d or 24 t h.  Because by then it is Christmas 
10 
Eve there is no courts to approach so I immediately set off and went to 
the high court I cannot remember if it was the high court or the labour 
court and obtained the interdict against her and that is where the 
matter ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever hear what the factual basis was for her 
to regard your position as redundant? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair there was no 
basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she did not advance any?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  There was absolutely 
20 
no valid reason or lawful reason that she had to – that she could have 
dismissed me from my post. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there was always going to be a need for the 
head of Hawks in the province?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 124 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody had ever – nobody had ever suggested that 
the Hawks in the province could be without a head? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair.  
I think one other thing she also mentioned if my memory serves me 
correctly is that the trust relationship between myself and the provincial 
commissioner had broken down. 
CHAIRPERSON: That was in her letter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That was part of that 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was part of that letter?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – did she ever file any affidavit in response 
to your urgent application either before the interdict was granted or 
later.  I assume it was a temporary interdict you got?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the problem that 
she had is she had no locus standi because of the Gl enister judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And it is on that basis 
that I managed to get the interdict.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The interdict ja. 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That she had no 
authority over me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Part to dismiss you. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  General Dramat had.  
And I think she realised that when she saw my papers.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 125 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And that they never 
opposed it. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  General Booysen please 
explain much mention is made of the ground coverage document which 
surfaced from crime intelligence.  Please explain the purpose of that 
document in context of the evidence you present today?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair the ground 
coverage 
document is 
a 
document 
that 
emanated 
from crime 
intelligence in KwaZulu Natal.  When the Cato Manor investigation 
10 
started and we had this – this focus on Cato Manor I one day went to 
Mr Bheki Cele because I could not understand what was going  on and I 
said to him, does – can he perhaps explain to me why is there this 
urgency to get rid of us?  He then explained to me that two things.  One 
is when it came to my appointment he had a …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry who were you asking now Bheki Cele?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Mr Bheki Cele the 
current Minister of Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes at that time what position was he holding?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I think – I 
20 
cannot recall whether he had.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  National Commissioner. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  No I think – no I think 
by then he was also himself suspended and had left.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 126 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I cannot recall exactly 
when that was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay so you say you asked him why some of 
you were being pushed out?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  And he – that is 
correct Chair and he mentioned two things to me.  He said my 
appointment the then Minister of Police was not happy with Nathi 
Mthethwe I do not know why.  He preferred someone else from the 
Eastern Cape.  But in the end Mr Cele was the national commissioner 
at the time it appears that he managed to convince the Minister that I 
10 
should be appointed.  The second thing is he said that he had a visit  
from while he was the national commissioner a visit from Richard Ndluli 
who requested him to stop the investigation against Ndluli and he 
refused.  The next thing a document comes from crime intelligence in 
KwaZulu Natal it is commonly known as the ground  coverage document.  
This document Chair is a – it is a very convoluted assembly of 
information and disinformation and conjecture mixed with facts but 
some of the important allegations in this document states that Mr Bheki 
Cele and a number of senior politicians had met I think it was in Grey 
Town where they discussed how they were going to unseat the then 
20 
President Mr Jacob Zuma.  A lot of the issues I – my name is also in 
that report in that Mr Bheki Cele owns taxies in the Stanger area and 
that he gets Booysen who then gets the Cato Manor people to take out 
his opponents and this is why I became a general.  That story 
eventually also appeared in the Sunday Times.  I think it was – SAPS 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 127 of 170 
 
disavowed any information pertaining to SAPS in that docket.  Senior 
politicians like – I stand to be corrected – I think it was 
Mr Tokyo Sexwale at the time made comments about the document and 
he actually said that the elephant in the room was Mdluli.  This 
document and why I know it comes from a specific individual Chair – I 
can explain later if it is necessary – but it definitely came from 
KwaZulu-Natal.  It was then given to Richard Mdluli and he was still – 
still in office because he declassified it.  He then took that document 
and sent it to the then President Mr  Jacob Zuma basically telling – 
showing him what these people are busy with and I think it is 
10 
roundabout just after that where he also wrote a letter to the President 
where he said that should he return to work that he would assist the 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this would – I remember that you said that that 
letter would have happened in 2011 or thereabout – the letter? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – this document that you have just spoken about 
when did it circulate or when did it emerge?  Was it roundabout the 
same time? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I think it was 
20 
roundabout 2010 roundabout there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  So it was before the letter?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was before the 
letter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the letter, yes.  Okay, alright thank you.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 128 of 170 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There are certain observations that 
you have made in relation to sequence of events which takes 
cognisance of this particular report and you do s o at paragraph 191 
page 56 of your affidavit.  Can I ask you to read these observations 
into the record please?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Thank you Chair.  
Paragraph 191 of my statement.  I say:  
“My observations of the sequence of events 
depicted below are conspicuous.  Number one, 
Mthethwa – he regularly appoints Mdluli as CI 
10 
Head.” 
And the reason why I say that Chair the then Minister of Police 
appointed Mdluli as a CI Head and at the time the National 
Commissioner at the time – Tim Williams – regarded his appointment as 
irregular.  They did not follow procedure and also Dr  Johan Burger from 
the Institute for Security Studies also commented at the time the 
appointment appears to be a political appointment.  
“After his appointment Mdluli starts to  allegedly loot 
the 
Secret 
Services 
Account. 
 
One 
of 
the 
benefactors of the looting of the Secret Services 
20 
Account is Mr Mthethwa himself.” 
And I have testified about the building of the fence around his – his 
premises Chair. 
“Subsequently 
Major-General Mark Hankel 
blows 
the whistle on the looting of this fund.  Then an 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 129 of 170 
 
investigation into the looting of the Secret Services 
Account commences.  Then there is a KZN leg of 
the 
investigation 
which 
is 
conducted 
by 
Brigadier Simon Madonsela.  Madonsela elicits my 
assistance 
in 
the 
investigation 
after 
Crime 
Intelligence refuse to release documents required 
to 
finalise 
the 
investigation. 
 
Mdluli 
earlier 
requested Cele…” 
That is now Minister  Bheki Cele. 
“…to stop the investigation initiated by Dramat and 
10 
Sibiya.  Mr Cele refuses.  Then the ground 
coverage document surfaces.  Mr  Cele is then 
suspended as the National Commissioner for an 
unrelated matter.” 
That was the Roux Shabangu matter Chair which you would recall and 
then: 
“The Sunday Times article pertaining to the  Cato 
Manor issue which contains the same allegations 
which are in the ground coverage document is 
established.” 
20 
Chair if I could perhaps just stop there quickly.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you mean to say published?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes.  So – but I would 
just like to say there Chair this ground coverage document I know it 
comes from a certain individual within Crime Intelligence.  A person by 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 130 of 170 
 
the name of Colonel N H Singh.  The reason why I know that is when I 
took the Sunday Times to the – to the Press Ombudsman we 
communicated to and fro about my complaints and they would respond 
and in one of their letters to the Press Ombudsman at the time they 
mentioned that one of their sources was Colonel  N H Singh who had 
given 
them 
the 
infor mation 
but 
more 
importantly 
General Deena Moodley was the Head of Crime Intelligence in 
KwaZulu-Natal told me personally that N  H Singh was responsible for 
the compilation of that document while he was seconded on duty to 
work with Richard Mdluli in Gauteng for a period of time.  I think it was 
10 
18 months and then: 
“After the Sunday Times article attempts to suspend 
me are made I obtained the interdict and then what 
happened afterwards had it reversed.  
And then the meeting which I testified about yesterday C hair where 
Mr Mthethwa meet the prosecutors essentially demanding our arrest.  
“That is according to the handwritten minutes of a 
meeting 
which 
Anthony  Mosing 
detailed 
on 
8 March 2012 and then flowing from that is the 
interview Karima Brown had with the Minister which 
20 
he admitted that he had a meeting with prosecutors 
although he tried to justify the meeting and then 
Cato 
Manor 
detectives 
are 
arrested 
for 
racketeering.  Two months later I was arrested for 
managing a so called criminal enterprise and then 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 131 of 170 
 
Mdluli 
is 
ultimately 
suspended 
pending 
the 
corruption and murder investigations.  When he 
attempts to return to office Freedom Under Law 
files an application in the High Court to prevent him 
from doing so.” 
And then what I say: 
“And in extra ordinary developm ent the National 
Commissioner – Riyah Piyega – then files an 
affidavit assisting him to go back to the office.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair a copy of that judgment is 
10 
found in Annexure J(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry Annexure Z(B) from pages 354 
to 441. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can now ask you to turn to page 
60 please?  Can you please – you make certain statements in relation 
to Riyah Piyega and Richard Mdluli.  Can you please clarify the 
relationship as you understood it to be or understand it to be between 
those two individuals? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair other than my 
observations that she was hell bent on getting rid of me in spite of me 
being exonerated on more than one occasion yet on the other hand 
someone that faces serious charges she tries to – well – not try to get 
him back to work but she – like Judge Murphy said she did not want to 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 132 of 170 
 
stand in his way to come back to work.  That to me just did not make 
sense. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If one were to look at paragraph 201 
you 
talk 
specifically 
to 
Riyah  Piyega’s 
relationship 
with 
Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba.  Is there any additional comments that you 
wish to make to that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair what happened 
there is subsequent to myself having laid a complaint against 
Advocate Jiba 
and 
the 
matter 
was 
being 
investigated 
by 
a 
Lieutenant-Colonel Botha.  He had investigated the matter and obtained 
10 
all the necessary statements I assume and then the next thing I he ard 
on the news that they wanted to serve a subpoena or a summons on 
Advocate Jiba to appear in court on charges and that she was not 
available at the office.  It was in the media at the time and then 
eventually the media reported that they had served a su mmons on 
Mr Nxasana to give to her because she reported to him and then that 
same evening I overheard – well I heard a radio statement of 
Mr Nxasana who took issue with General  Piyega for the role she played 
because there appears to have been a spat betwee n Piyega and 
Nxasana and it was evident from the news reports and from the radio 
20 
interviews that there was conflict between the NDPP and the National 
Commissioner of the Police.  In my view the National Commissioner of 
the Police should not have involved her with decisions taken by the 
NDPPs Office which she clearly did.  She was so incensed by the fact 
that Advocate Jiba eventually received the summons that she summarily 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 133 of 170 
 
terminated the services of Colonel  Botha.  Colonel Botha had been on 
an extended contract.  He was one of the investigating officers in the 
Oscar Pistorius matter but she summarily terminated his contract and 
then General Muno who was then the Divisional Head of the Detectives 
assigned 
that 
document 
to 
– 
I 
think 
– 
it 
was 
a 
Major-General (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in paragraph 196 you say that:  
“It emerged in your disciplinary hearing that 
Mr Mdluli 
had 
interfered 
with 
the 
Panday 
investigation as well.”  
10 
And you refer to Major General Lazarus. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
when 
my 
disciplinary hearing was ongoing when they closed the case against me 
it was now my turn to give evidence.  I had approached a number of the 
investigators from the Hawks to come and give evidence on my behalf 
and most of them undertook to do so but every time I would phone them 
a day or two before the time they disappeared.  I could not get hold of 
them.  My attorney eventually managed to get hold of them and they 
20 
were given instruction.  They said they instruction came from Piyega 
that they cannot come and testify in my favour.  At that time 
Soobramoney – Chair would recall - who was one of the investigators in 
the beginning whom I had to investigate who.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the Panday matter? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 134 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He had told me at the 
time that he had resigned but I had found out in the meantime that he 
had not resigned.  That he was working at Crime Intelligence in Benoni.  
I then managed to trace him and I asked him Vassan are you prepared 
to come and testify for me and he said yes I will.  I did not tell anyone 
that he was coming.  We were – the hearing at that stage was in 
chambers here in Sandton.  So I said to him I will pick him up at the 
Gautrain Station which I did the morning.  I took him in.  It was at that 
10 
stage where they wanted General  Ngobeni to come and testify and I 
knew she would not come and then said no they are going to adjourn 
now because she did not arrive.  I said no I do have a witness here.  
We can proceed with this witness.  Chair I was – I was unaware of what 
he was going to testify about but I was.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ngobeni? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
No 
this 
was 
Vassan Soobramoney. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Ngobeni 
never 
20 
pitched. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I just wanted him to 
confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 135 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The issues around the 
investigation but while he was giving evidence – and that was the first 
time I heard about it – he said that in the initial stages of the 
investigation he was approached by Richard  Mdluli and Solly Lazarus – 
also a Major-General from the Hawks who has now been dismissed - I 
think – also issues relating to the slash fund.  They were approached – 
they approached him in Ballito where they told him that they have got 
information that his life is under threat and they propos ed to him it is 
better if he comes to Gauteng and comes – if he goes - comes to Crime 
Intelligence  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Soobramoney? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Soobramoney Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
they 
also 
indicated to him that there is a possibility that he might be promoted if 
he comes.  I – this was not reported to me.  That was now the first time 
I heard about this.  He then said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  At the disciplinary hearing?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  At the disciplinary 
hearing Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He says - that is what 
Soobramoney told me.  He then – because he feared for his life – 
because he has got a wife and a kid I think – he decided to take up this 
position with Crime Intelligence and be known and he said to me he sat 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 136 of 170 
 
in the office doing nothing.  He told them at the time that he needed to 
continue with the – with the Panday investigation.  He said but he was 
basically just left there in the office to such an extent he was getting so 
bored he pleaded with then to give him something to do even if it is 
some HR work.  So the hand of Mdluli is clear into the interference of 
the investigation of Panday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at the time that Soobramoney was – at the time 
that he moved from KZN to Benoni was he still involved in the Panday 
investigation? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was supposed to be continuing with it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair he told me he is 
going to resign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he told you he had resigned?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So obviously – and you say but he had not resigned?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I – I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had resigned from the Hawks maybe?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair but – initially 
he told me that he had resigned but later on obviously through your 
20 
contacts in the police I established that he was working at Crime 
Intelligence in Benoni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So – so when he moved from KZN to 
Benoni he was still involved in the Panday investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Up until the day he 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 137 of 170 
 
left Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up until ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then when he left once he was in Crime 
Intelligence then obviously he was going to be doing something else?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes, but then he did 
nothing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then he – he say he did nothing and would there 
10 
have been other people who would have continued with the Panday 
investigation in his absence?  Do you know?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair there – 
there were a couple of investigators.  Colonel Hans Van Loggenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
And 
there 
was 
Colonel Hurst. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Most of them were 
people from the ex-Scorpions DSO. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Even Soobramoney 
was also from the DSO.  
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time that Soobramoney gave evidence in your 
disciplinary hearing how long had he been in Benoni?  Do you – do you 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 138 of 170 
 
have some idea?  I am just trying to understa nd to the extent that this 
may have disturbed the Panday investigation.  How long did it?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair I would say 
probably about two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About two years.  Did that coincide with the time 
when you were on suspension or part of the time?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It coincided with a 
period of my suspension Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay and did you get to know for how long he 
was sitting there doing nothing in Benoni – of the two years? 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Well Chair he told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Soobramoney himself 
told me after he had given evidence that he sat there doing nothing and 
he actually pleaded with them to give him something to do.  He  was 
getting bored. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He even said that – 
he asked them give me some HR work to do.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So was your understanding that he was talking 
20 
about that entire period since he had left KZN that he  was sitting there 
doing nothing?  So if that period was two years that would have been 
two years of doing nothing. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is exactly what 
he told me Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 139 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Booysen do you confirm that 
there are in fact two affidavits that have been attached to your affidavit 
from Colonel Brian Padayachee? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And do you also confirm that it was 
Colonel Brian Padayachee who managed the intelligence in relation to 
the Panday investigation?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did Riyah Piyega get involved in the 
10 
upliftment of communication recordings at all?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  She did Chair.  What 
happened is Padayachee whom – who was in charge of the monitoring 
of the Act 17 interceptions at one stage also reported to Riyah  Piyega 
issues relating to the investigation and I think that is perhap s 
something that he can talk about but for – for his effort he also got 
suspended and then a while later he informed me that – Chair how it 
works is the interceptions are done at a specific place in Pretoria.  The 
investigators would sit in their respectiv e provinces.  It is not live 
listening.  So they record and then they will send it to the investigators 
20 
but the originals are kept in – in Pretoria.  Then at one stage 
Padayachee informed me that General  Piyega has sent a Brigadier – I 
cannot recall the name – I think it was a White lady.  I stand to be 
corrected – to uplift the intercepted calls – the actual discs but Chair if 
it is indeed true and she did not follow due process in my view that is – 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 140 of 170 
 
she committed a criminal offence.  She might have followe d due 
process but I am not aware that she had followed proper protocol and 
process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair for the record I failed to 
mention that the affidavits of Colonel  Padayachee is reflected at 
EXHIBIT Z(B) which is J(B) 26 page 472 until 49 8.  At paragraph 207 of 
your affidavit do you confirm that Riyah  Piyega was also the subject of 
a 
criminal 
investigation 
when 
she 
alerted 
Lieutenant-General Arno Lamoer? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I confirm that Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was an alert of a criminal 
investigation against him?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That is true Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But this – but it did not result in any 
prosecution steps being taken?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  No Chair, it did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have missed this.  Did you cover – did you 
cover that issue about Major –General Ntombela at 199 and Hankel? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair with regards to 
General Ntombela. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
While 
they 
were 
having the disciplinary hearing against me he phoned me and we met 
and he told me that he was the first person that was given the task to 
investigate me. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 141 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was his position – Ntombela? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Chair 
he 
was 
a 
Provincial Commissioner either in Limpopo or Mpumalanga.  I cannot 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So he phoned you and said wha t? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  So I meet him and he 
says to me he just wants to tell me he was the first person who was 
10 
allocated with the investigation against me and that he did not feel 
comfortable with it and he did some investigations – I do not know what 
he did but he reported back to - I think it was at the time 
General Piyega and she obviously was not happy with that but the other 
important thing is Chair - and that is what he told me.  Piyega asked 
Ntombela to investigate the conduct of Ge neral Mark Hankel the whistle 
blower.  So he did a complete investigation.  When he finalised his 
investigation his conclusions were that Mark  Hankel had done nothing 
wrong.  He had done the right thing and he said to me Piyega was 
furious with him.  She then allocated the investigation to someone else 
20 
but the important thing Chair at that point the contracts of both 
General Ntombela and General Ngobeni had come to end.  He had a 
clear record – absolute clear record.  He had no complaints.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ntombela? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Ntombela. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 142 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  His contract was not 
renewed whereas General Ngobeni having all these investigations 
hanging over her head General  Piyega renewed her contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and which year are we talking about at that 
time more or less – if you are able to (intervenes)?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would say 2013/2014 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certainly that was a time when the investigation 
against the Provincial Commissioner in KZN – Ngobeni – had started. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had started a year or two before?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair it was in an 
advanced stage.  I think it coincide s with a letter that Advocate Noko - I 
alluded to that yesterday and I actually mentioned that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  In my response to 
Noko’s memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  That I find it no 
coincidence 
that 
that 
report 
was 
released 
at 
the 
time 
that 
General Ngobeni’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Contract had expired. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 143 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
somewhere in 2014 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you say there was – there was a Provincial 
Commissioner in Mpumalanga or whatever the province that Ntombela 
was in who as far as you know had a clean record, had no complaints 
against him and he had been asked to investigate you and he found 
nothing and reported accordingly to General  Piyega.  His contract was 
not renewed and then the contract of the Provincial Commissioner in 
KZN Major-General Ngobeni there was an investigation pending against 
10 
her but hers was renewed.  That is what you are saying?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Over and above that 
the issue that he was instructed to investigate Mark  Hankel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  The whistle blower. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Which Piyega was 
also – well the result of which she was not.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Happy with either. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Ntombela made – conducted that investigation as 
well? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He told me. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 144 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and found nothing wrong?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
Nothing 
against 
Mark Hankel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then General Piyega was very angry about 
that? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  He said she was very 
angry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If we can now turn 
to page 62 of your report?  The next individual who you refer to is  
10 
Major-General Jan Mabula.  Your concerns in relation to this particular 
individual is mentioned in the context of three investigations.  The first 
is one which relates to the former Police Commissioner Jackie  Selebi.  
The other is a several multimillion R and investigation of exhibit money 
which was recovered after a heist at O R T International Airport with - 
which was stolen from the Benoni Police Station and the last is in 
relation to the investigation of the Cato Manor Death Squad.  It is in 
that context that you place evidence before this Commissioner?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  It is in that context 
Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please give detail to your 
evidence relating to Mabula in the context of those investigations?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Chair Major-General 
Jan – I think it is Ntebo – Mabula but we know him as Jan  Mabula was 
my counterpart in the North West Province.  When the – when the Cato 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 145 of 170 
 
Manor matter started General  Dramat told me that he is appointing 
Mabula, 
General Ntsika 
and 
General Badie 
to 
investigate 
the 
allegations in the Sunday Tribune.  Ntsika never arrived and Badie 
never arrived.  Mabula arrived with a team from the North West.  One of 
them I recall was Colonel Mano also a very controversial officer who 
subsequently passed away.  It did not strike me at the time but later on 
I put two and two together.  Mabula – General Mabula was in cahoots 
with Advocate Jiba at the time of the arrest of Advocate  Gerrie Nel.  
What transpired Chair after my arrest  I received a phone call from a 
senior police officer who wanted me to meet someone.  So I happened 
10 
to be in Pretoria and we met at Centurion at the McDonalds and this 
person related the following story to me Chair.  He said to me what 
Mabula is doing to y ou is wrong because he is guilty of something like 
that himself and he related the following story to me.  There was a 
huge heist at the O R Tambo airport.  I think over R100 million was 
stolen.  Whether it was Dollars or Rand I cannot recall Chair and 
people were arrested for that and the monies was recovered and kept in 
the safe at – I think – Benoni Organised Crime.  Someone broke into – 
into the offices and I think R12 million was stolen.  Mabula at the time 
was a Colonel and he was tasked to lead the i nvestigation into the theft 
20 
of the money.  Chair then I started to do some research myself 
afterwards but let me continue with the story.  He says one of the 
people who they arrested is a guy by the name – I think Solly Ngwenya 
– a suspect in the matter.  He was taken to the Mmakau Police Station 
and at the Mmakau Police Station they were busy interrogating him.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 146 of 170 
 
Jan Mabula was in an adjacent office.  He was not present.  He was in 
the office next door and he was there with – I think – she was a 
Captain Makwena.  He says and they were busy interrogating this 
suspect – Solly Ngwenya but they were torturing him.  He was part of it.  
He told me and he says he described me to.  They would take a tube 
and then put it over his head until the person suffocates.  A long story 
short.  This person collapsed and they could not revive him.  Then they 
realised this person had died.  He says and then he went next door or 
they went next door, I can’t recall whether it was him or...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s Mabula telling you the story or what?  
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was telling you the story?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   It’s a gentleman, I do 
not want to mention his name...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you don’t want to mention his name okay.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: But if the Chair would 
want me to I can – but I think for his own safety...(intervention).   
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Because 
what 
happened afterwards Chair, people were being killed left, right and 
20 
centre.  They then went next door to tell Mabula, we’ve got a problem 
now this man (indistinct) he doesn’t want to wake up.  Then Mabula was 
sitting on the chair he fell down, he passed out himsel f and then one of 
the captains there, it was a Captain Dube, female captain took her coat 
and waved him to wake up so when he woke up they realised they had 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 147 of 170 
 
a problem.  So they decided they were going to take the body to, I think 
the Baragwanath Hospital a nd then they took him to the hospital to say, 
no this man had a heart attack.  When they arrived at the hospital the 
doctor said no, no this man has been dead for about two hours now he 
didn’t have a heart attack.  They went back and reported this to 
Mabula, Mabula then had some arrangement, he didn’t give me those 
details with a doctor who eventually certified this person dead.  The 
family at the time and the media, I obviously later on started reading 
about it, was very unhappy that their family member ha d died in police 
custody.  Then the people that were present, when this person died, 
10 
when Solie died, Mabula met them at a lake, I can’t recall – I think it 
was Germiston lake where he told them how to formulate their 
statements.  They had a follow-up meeting in which – and they 
described to me the one guy said no they’re having nightmares, 
nightmares.  I said to him, what do you mean nightmares, he says no 
they were saying that one of the people that were present when Solie 
died was that – they were having nightmares at night, this man was 
spooking by them and then Mabula would say to them, no don’t worry 
we’ll sort it out and he told them exactly how to make their statements.  
 
Chair at that point I listened to what he said but I was in the 
20 
middle of the fight of my life with Jiba and all and sundry I didn’t do 
anything about it at the time.  Six months later I get a call from General 
Shadrack Sibiya, I might mention Chair, the person who introduced me 
to this other person was General Shadrack Sibiya.  He th en said to me, 
Johan did you report this thing to ICD, I said to him Shadrack, I’m too 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 148 of 170 
 
busy fighting my own battles here I haven’t got time for that, he says 
no, no the person who related the story to me and another person who 
was off sick, they were the o nly two people that never made statements 
at the time that Solie Ngwenya died and now all of a sudden ICD is 
approaching them for statements.  I said to him, Shadrack I can give 
you an undertaking I did not contact ICD I’m too busy.  He said to me, 
can these guys come and see you, I said by all means.  Chair that was 
about 5 o’clock in the afternoon, 7 o’clock the following morning I 
received a call they’re in Durban, so it must have been of some concern 
to them because they had driven through the night.   
10 
 
I then asked, I think it was Colonel – Captain Pelser from my 
office if he’s got a recording device for me, I took a recording device 
with me and I met them on the beach front and I had arranged with a 
person that I know at the Sun Coast Casino that we ca n go and sit in 
one of the restaurants and talk.  So they enquired from me, they said to 
me, it’s just strange that they were the only two that never made 
statements in that matter in which Ngwenya died but now the ICD wants 
to see them and I told them there’s no ways it was me that told the ICD 
and then we tried – I tried to figure out who it could have been and we 
had some discussion and Chair then...(intervention).  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the ICD the predecessor to the IPID?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  Yes Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So Chair then I said 
to them but let’s just recoup what happened when Solie died and then 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 149 of 170 
 
they told me the whole story from the beginning to the end exactly like 
he told me the previous time and I then said to them look my – the only 
suggestion that I can make to you guys, go to a lawyer, make an 
affidavit, go to the Prosecuting Authority and lay your cards on the 
table because there’s a whole group of you people it’s – the first one 
that decides to become a 204 witness and I said to them look, what I’ll 
do for you is, I’ll take  you to my lawyer.  I made an arrangement for my 
lawyer to meet them, he met with them, they related the story to – and 
he gave them – the lawyer gave them th e same advice.  They said they 
would think about it but it was clear that they were extremely scared.  
10 
They then left and they said that they would let us know.  They never 
went to a lawyer and deposed an affidavit.  I subsequently took the 
recording and I gave it to Mr McBride.  Mr McBride initiated an 
investigation and not long after that he was suspended himself.  When 
he returned to office he phoned me and he said to me the recording had 
gone missing, do I have another copy, I said no, I have another co py so 
I favoured him with another copy.  Subsequent to that Mr McBride told 
me that they had managed to obtain corroborating evidence and the 
matter had gone to the DPP and those were one of the cases that Mr 
McBride expressed his frustrations about, that they were not getting 
20 
any positive feedback from the National Prosecuting Authority, I don’t 
know where the docket is right now Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I might just add 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 150 of 170 
 
if, I managed to obtain a copy of the post-mortem report of Solie 
Ngwenya and the post-mortem report says he died from asphyxiation.  
CHAIRPERSON:   From? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  From asphyxiation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   So he’s in police 
custody he dies from – someone must be held accountable for his death 
it’s not – if you die from asphyxiation it’s an unnatural death while 
you’re in police custody and no-one is responsible for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair which takes us 
to his investigation with the Cato Manor matter.  When he arrived there, 
I said to him, Jan here’s my office, here’s my equipment I made 
everything at his disposal and I think I did testify  about this earlier on 
where people like Mostert would phone me and say to me the 
investigators have traced their informers and they’re putting pressure 
on the informers to change their versions and that’s when I also 
received a call from Lieutenant Zungu who met me and told me he had 
been approached  by detectives working with Mabula and he told me 
that Mabula was present in the room at the Blue Waters Hotel where 
20 
they interrogated him about certain issues relating to the killing of 
Mkhize and they wanted Zungu to change his statement to implicate me 
in the killing of Mkhize and he refused.  
CHAIRPERSON:   To implicate you? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Yes Chair and he 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 151 of 170 
 
refused, Zungu refused and...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   This was Mabula and w ho, who were...(intervention). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   The detectives that 
worked with Mabula. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh Mabula wasn’t there but it was detectives.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair he told me 
Mabula was there and prior to m e giving evidence, I just wanted to 
make sure, I phoned him again, I said to him Zungu, I just want to 
confirm, you told me that Mabula was present there and he said yes he 
was present. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair on that point a copy of 
Zibusiwe William Zungu’s statement is included in the bundle in Exhibit 
ZB and it begins at page 500 with a typed version continuing to page 
508.  The next individual that you deal with is Colonel Rajen Aiyer and 
that’s on page 64, you have already  given much evidence in relation to 
Colonel Aiyer to the extent that – based on the evidence that you have 
given there’s nothing – there’s nothing additional in the affidavit as 
such.  Is there any additional remarks you may wish to make in relation 
to him? 
20 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I think I’ve 
testified extensively about Mr Rajen Aiyer.  He was subsequently 
dismissed from the police for dishonesty, there’s another case pending 
against him, of intimidation and – well, no, no sorry Chair h e was 
dismissed for the case still under investigation for intimidation and a 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 152 of 170 
 
few other charges that matter, I understand is with the DPP’s office.  In 
another matter in which he fabricated evidence against individuals in a 
robbery matter, the Magistrate Mr Anand Maharaj ordered an enquiry 
into his evidence where he lied under oath and fabricated evidence, he 
got his girlfriend to  make statements which were untrue, to implicate 
people that weren’t implicated in the commission of that offence at all 
and that disciplinary hearing and the criminal trial is still in the process 
but subsequent to that he committed another offence which is still 
under investigation but he was dismissed from the police for that.  The 
point I’m making Chair is here we have a person  with a very dubious 
10 
character which got an axe to grind with myself whom I had to – 
charged departmentally, he was found guilty and basically kicked out of 
the Hawks by General Dramat and that’s the type of person – and even 
if he’s – what he says is true in his statement Judge Gorven held that it 
relates to nothing other than office politics but that’s the type of 
witness – that’s their key witness Chair that advocate Jiba and Shaun 
Abrahams relies upon to convict me for racketeering.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then take you to page 65 at 
which you deal with the next individual who’s named Brigadier 
Niyameka Xaba.  Do you confirm that this particular Brigadier worked 
20 
under your command? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And do you also confirm that he was 
involved in the investigation relating to the complaint from Tom 
Moyane? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 153 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   He was also involved – or rather 
under Brigadier Xaba’s command...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let him testify, let him testify.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem Chair.  Do you have any 
comments in relation to his involvement on the matter concerning Mr 
Flock Simmington. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes now put your questions more neutrally. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair Brigadier Xaba 
10 
used to work with me in KwaZulu Natal, he was a colonel then and 
eventually he was promoted to head office where he is a brigadier.  My 
understanding that he’s – he heads Crimes Against the State and I refer 
to the PCLU at the National Prosecuting Authority yesterday who are 
mandated to do serious crimes like human trafficking, foreign military 
assistance Act.  Crimes Agains t the State, in my view would relate to 
crimes such as treason, sedition and crimes of that nature.  So to start 
off with, I find it suspicious that a brigadier who is in charge of Crimes 
Against the State manages to get himself involved with an investigat ion 
relating to a complaint by Mr Tom Moyane, I don’t regard that complaint 
20 
as being a crime against the state.  During that investigation there was 
an incident that was televised on television where Mr Xaba and people 
with him – and that’s my observations  of watching what I saw on TV, 
kept in a room against his will, they also took or attempted to take 
documents from him by force which, in my view could amount to at least 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 154 of 170 
 
common assault.  My understanding that a case was opened but under 
the stewardship of the NPA at the time Mr Shaun Abrahams 
unsurprisingly that matter was also declined to prosecute.  I was also 
told by Mr McBride that Xaba had involved with the investigation 
against Misesi Koko and Mr Innocent Khoba but Chair the point I’m 
making is, a brigadier heading crimes against the state getting involved 
with these type of matters.  What I also found very strange was, in one 
of the affidavits that advocate Jiba deposed to in a civil litigation that 
we were involved in, he happens to be the person th at commissions her 
statement.  One could read anything and like that but I just find it a bit 
10 
suspicious.  Mr Xaba might argue that the investigation is lawful, the 
investigation might have been lawful but I find it a bit conspicuous that 
he had involved himself in these type of investigations and I just want 
to go back a bit further Chair, same prosecutors every time, same 
investigators every time. Brigadier Xaba, and I know him personally, 
he’s got a LLB degree, he should know what is right and what is wr ong 
when it comes to what to do and what not to do.  He’s not stupid he 
should have told whoever told him to do what he was doing, he should 
have told them, I’m not going to involve myself with this or at least 
have booked off sick or do something but he k new well that he was 
20 
doing the bidding of someone else when he performed these actions.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then the last individual that you 
deal with is on page 66 and that is Brigadier Pharasa Ncube.  What are 
your comments in relation to this brigadier? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I’ve already 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 155 of 170 
 
given evidence how he arrested me, he didn’t even know what a 
founding affidavit was but nevertheless, he was the henchman tasked 
to arrest me the first time I was arrested and he was al so the henchman 
tasked to arrest me the second time when Shaun Abrahams authorised 
my prosecution and I recall when they took me to the cells the second 
time around at Durban Central Police Station, the moment the cell 
doors close he immediately made a cal l and he said, General he was 
arrested.  Now the only general that I can think of that he had phoned 
at the time, and I’m speculating but it must have been General 
Ntlemeza.  There was no reason, Chair, to once again chuck me in the 
10 
cells, put me in the back of a police car and then cart me to court and 
then put me at the bottom of the grill and up the stairs like a common 
criminal.  Chair Ncube also got involved with ...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   So they put you at the back of a police van?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   They wanted to Chair 
but then there was another officer, I cannot – no, no, no I can, it was a 
Brigadier Pembe, I think it was, I had done a course with him in 
Stellenbosch, he heard from his office that I’m in the cells at Durba n 
Central and they were going to put me in the back of the police van to 
take me to Court.  He then came down and he said to them there’s now 
20 
ways he’s going to allow – because him and myself were like partners 
on this course in Stellenbosch and he told th em there’s no ways he’s 
going to let me drive in the back of a police van he’s going to take me 
in his police car, so I jumped in the car with him, he took me to court.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  In that instance 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 156 of 170 
 
can I ask that we please turn to slide 6 which appears in bundle ZD and 
that’s the diagrams bundle.   General Booysen you will recall that at the 
beginning of your evidence and I shall quote,...(intervention).  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair before – can I 
just make a correction it was General Mpethe, I’ve just remembered 
now the guy who said he’s not going to allow them to put me in the 
police van he’s going to take me himself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh what’s his name? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
Mpethe 
I 
can’t 
remember his first name Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s the spelling, have I got it here?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   No it’s not on my 
statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay have you got the spelling?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair I’ll spell it M-p-
e-t-h-e. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay what was his position?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That time he was a 
brigadier Chair, but I understand he’s now a general.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thanks. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay let’s deal with slide 6.  Do you 
confirm that this slide is essentially a consolidation of the two previous 
slides, the one which deals with individuals in the prosecution cluster 
and the other being individuals within the law enforcement cluster?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   I do Chair. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 157 of 170 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair the key on the top right-hand 
side informs that the law enforcement individuals are marked in a black 
background and the prosecution individuals are marked in a white 
background which for some or other reason does not appear on the 
slide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It’s the next slide.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat what you have just said.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
 Yes, 
Chair the 
witness 
has 
confirmed that this is a combina tion of the two slides on the top right-
10 
hand side is a little block which has a black backing and that indicates 
the 
law 
enforcement 
individuals 
which 
populate 
the 
diagram...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page of that – this Exhibit is that, I thought I’ve 
got it but it looks like I haven’t got it.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s the last page Chair, page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does this diagram not suffer from the challenges that 
I mentioned earlier in regard to the other one – okay, alright I’m there. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This diagram the witness has 
confirmed is a combined diagram of the law enforcement diagram and 
20 
the prosecutions diagram and in particular the individuals that this 
witness, Mr General Booysen has addressed in his evidence.  General  
Booysen if I could point you to the diagram as such...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said something about how – about those who are 
in black and those who are in white, the individuals whose names are 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 158 of 170 
 
written on white would be prosecutors of NPA perso nnel – prosecutors. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you have got names of – that are on black 
you say those are investigators?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That’s individuals from the law 
enforcement team, be it the Hawks or the  South African Police 
Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From SAPS?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s simply a combination of the two 
previous diagrams.  Having said that if I could take you to the diagram 
itself, there appears to be common role players as you’ve already given 
evidence to.  When I say common role players I’m specifically talking 
about individuals who have been involved in more than one of the 
cases that you’ve given evidence to, is that corr ect? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   That’s true Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I could then take you down to the 
key on the bottom left-hand side which then identifies the individuals 
who have been involved in more than one case as you’ve give n 
20 
evidence to being the Panday investigation marked in blue, the Amigos 
case marked in red, the looting of the Secret Service Account marked in 
yellow and the Cato Manor investigation marked in green.  Can I ask 
you to read into the record the individuals who appear common in more 
than one matter as indicated in the key on the bottom left -hand side. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 159 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   You refer to the 
cross-cutting persons? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes please – yes General Booysen. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair in the Cato 
Manor investigation the Secret Services Account investigation, the 
common denominator there from the advocates are advocate Jiba 
Ntenjwa.  With regards to the Secret Services Account and the Panday 
case Ntlameza, the Panday case and the Amigo case, Mgwebi.  The 
Amigo case and the Cato Manor case Mosing, the Panday case and the 
Amigo case and the Cato Manor case Noko.  Cato Manor case the 
10 
Secret Services Account case and the Panday case Ngluli and Phiyega.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you. Is there any coincidence 
based on your experience to there being common individuals involved 
in these matters? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair from time to 
time there will be coincidences where certain individuals will over lap 
with other individuals but over a period of time invariably the same 
names from the Prosecuting Authority, the same names from SAPS, the 
same investigators from SAPS, when these types of investigations – I 
refer specifically about the Cato Manor investigation, the Panday 
20 
investigation, the Amigos case investigation, the looting of the 
(indistinct) investigation, the rendition investigation and the SARS so 
called rouge – Chair I think I have a better chance of winning the lotto 
but it’s impossible that the same people, somehow, just figure to be the 
prosecutor or the investigator or the manager of these investigators in 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 160 of 170 
 
all those cases Chair over a period of time.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I could then turn your direction to 
the blocks alongside the circles, so if we start with the red circle which 
is the Amigos block, alongside it is marked a block, beneficiaries in the 
Amigos case.  In your view, based on the evidence that you’ve given 
who were the beneficiaries in the Amigos case?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   In the Amigos case 
the obvious beneficiaries are Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then in the Panday investigation 
which 
is 
the 
circle 
marked 
blue, 
there’s 
another 
block 
10 
which...(intervention). 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN: 
 
 
There 
the 
beneficiaries in the Panday matter Chair would be Colonel Navin 
Madhoe, Captain Narain Persat, Lieutenant General Nkobeni she’s now 
resigned from the police, Toshan Panday, Deebo Mzobe and Edward 
Zuma. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if one had to do the same to the 
block alongside the yellow circle which deals with the looting of the 
Secret Service account, who were the beneficiaries?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair although in my 
20 
view there were a number  of beneficiaries but the ones that I directly 
dealt with and know about is Richard Mdluli and Minister Nathi 
Mthethwa. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could then remind you of 
evidence that you placed before this Commission on your first day of 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 161 of 170 
 
hearing when looking at the overall organogram, dealing with both the 
police and dealing with the justice clusters it was your evidence that 
the clusters of police, justice, intelligence, finance, governance, 
parliament and the Presidency cannot do without each other .  They all 
form very important gears in this big machinery and if any one of those 
are absent the whole justice system will be compromised and that’s the 
evidence that you have given. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:   Chair that’s my 
evidence that that’s imperative. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So what would be the benefit of 
10 
anyone who would have a beneficial right over the National Prosecuting 
Justice cluster or rather, apologies over the justice cluster or even the 
police cluster? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN:  I would like you to 
rephrase that question please?  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is a good idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just rephrase the question so the witness will 
understand it. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  You have 
highlighted beneficiaries relative to each particular investigation.  Do 
you have any comment as to exactly what the benefit would be to 
anyone who has – who is in a position in decision makin g positions 
within these clusters? 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 162 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair if I understand 
the question it is acousmatic that if you are in charge of a cluster you 
wield some sort of power.  And that power ought to be used with 
discretion and within the  confines of the constitution and within the 
confines of the law.   Unfortunately my evidence I would allege 
indicates that a number of people in these key positions were there 
either placed there to benefit certain individuals, politicians and 
businessmen.  I do not believe for one moment that the prosecutors 
involved, that I have discussed here Chair I do not believe that for one 
moment that they acted without fear or favour.  In my view they acted 
10 
wrongfully.  I will not – well I have opened criminal cas es against some 
of them.  They have acted, they have not acted in the spirit of the 
constitution.  They have not acted according to their own policy 
guidelines or their own code of conduct.  Chair in my view some of 
them are a disgrace to the national pros ecuting authority.  With regards 
to Law Enforcement Chair Berning Ntlemeza Chair is the biggest 
disaster that has ever hit Law Enforcement in this country.  He has 
[indistinct] a vital institution to fight corruption in our country Chair.  
Chair we see all over the country there is service delivery protests I 
have always maintained there is money around but unfortunately there 
20 
are corrupt elements in our society that enrich themselves at the 
expense of the poor.  And then you have a person that is supposed to 
be exposing these – the corruption but then he becomes part of a group 
of people that cover up the corruption.  And the same applies to the 
prosecutors that I have mentioned Chair.   
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 163 of 170 
 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And then the last 
part of your affidavit deals specifically with the role of intelligence 
services and the Sunday Times.  That can be found on page 66 starting 
from paragraph 225.  General Booysen do you have any comments in 
relation to the role of the intelligence services and the S unday Times? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I have 
mentioned before that the SARS so called rogue unit, the Cato Manor 
so called death squad and the so called rendition investigation are all 
in necessary can be linked.  In all of those instance s the intelligence 
services would leak information to – to journalists the same two 
10 
journalists time and time again.  Stefan Hofstatter and Mzilikazi wa 
Afrika.  Exposes would follow.  Once the exposes are published within a 
work or two the Johan Von Logge nbergs, the Anwa Dramats, the Johan 
Booysens, the Shadrack Sibiyas and so I can carry on are suspended.  
Investigations that they are busy with become dormant.  It is no 
coincidence Chair and it is – that has been the modus operandi.  
Leaking of information and Chair I think it is important that I mention 
that the current editor of the Sunday Times Mr Siqoko he at least had 
the courage of his conviction to approach me and extend a hand to me 
to apologise.  The editor of the time Mr Ray Hartley he is missing  in 
20 
action so I do not want to paint the current editor under the – well 
blame him for the ills of what happened previously.  And Chair that is 
one example how the media could be abused to further nefariums, 
nefarious agendas by certain individuals.  I hav e been approached by a 
professor from one of the universities who is busy writing a book on 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 164 of 170 
 
how the – how the media could be exploited or used to further nefarious 
goals.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you confirm General 
Booysen that in October 2018 the editor of the Sunday Times Mr 
Bongani Siqoko apologised for getting the Cato Manor publication 
wrong and that there was in fact an apology that was published which 
appears as an attachment to your affidavit at page 510?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSE N:  Chair that is indeed 
so and Mr Siqoko also gave me an opportunity to write a full page 
unedited in the Sunday Times which I did.  He went as far as to say 
10 
that he would write an editorial comment which he would allow me to 
edit and that says a lot abou t him.  He had shown me his – his editorial 
comment and I did not change a thing and my article went in 
unpublished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uncorrect – un-amended? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Un-amended Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I would also just like to 
point your direction to the affidavit of Colonel Padayachee which at 
page 475 and paragraph 11 also deals with the involvement of the 
20 
media and in particular Mr Wa Afrika.  And then I have just realised 
General Booysen that I forgot to ask you to confirm one of your 
affidavits which is attached to your papers and that is in fact the 
affidavit that you had prepared which was unsigned and that you 
intended to hand or rather that you handed to Major General Matakata.  
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 165 of 170 
 
Can I ask you to just quickly page to 348 of File Z[B] and confirm that 
that is in fact the affidavit that you had handed in which dealt with your 
visit to the Gupta residence?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Which page? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is page 348.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Major General Booysen are you looking at the correct 
lever arch file? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Yes, yes I have found 
it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I confirm this is the 
statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you so much.  And 
then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the affidavit that you handed to the acting 
head of the Hawks after General Ntlemeza had left?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  That is right.  General 
Matakata. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  The last annexure that I would 
like to direct your attention to is annexure 29 which is of the same 
bundle Exhibit Z[B].   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 329? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is Exhibit 29 which is at page 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 166 of 170 
 
– starts at 513. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit 29? 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair.  Oh apologies.  
Exhibit Z[B]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 513. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you recognise this article 
General Booysen? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I do Chair. 
10 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Were you involved in the 
production of this article?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  I was Chair. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And do you have any comments 
in relation to this particular article?  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I refer to the 
compilation of this document when I was invited to the Nelson Mandela 
Foundation.  That is where this documen t originated from. It is a 
combination of universities that did research on and they titled the 
document Betrayal of the Promise how South Africa is being stolen.  It 
20 
inter alia narrates some of the issues that I dealt with in my 
investigation and they acc urately  
CHAIRPERSON:  Record it. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Reflect what… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 167 of 170 
 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  What my submissions 
were to the researchers in this document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  And just for the record Chair 
this particular excerpt only includes page 3, 19, 50, 51 and 52 of that 
particular report.  And then finally General Booysen do you have any 
closing remarks? 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am not going 
to talk from my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  The first thing Chair I 
would like to say I am very – I really appreciate this opportunity after 
six of – and seven years of – of attack after attack after attack of 
people that supposed to be protecting me.  Chair I am grateful for this 
opportunity.  It is – and I am also grateful for the two advocates that 
dealt with me Advocate September and Advocate Pretorius and also the 
investigators Mr Groenewald for the understanding in the way the y 
dealt with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Chair I am going to 
20 
conclude I do not want to make a long speech.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  But as long as the 
people that I have mentioned in m y statement they can change the 
head of the Hawks, they can change the head of the NPA, they can 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 168 of 170 
 
change the State President but as long as these people remain there 
Chair and I will be proven right if they so happen to stay there.  It 
happened with Mr Nxasana.  Mr Nxasana I did not know him personally 
I had managed to meet him at a much later stage.  Mr Nxasana felt the 
brunt of a cabal within the NPA.  I felt the brunt of a cabal with – when 
I was member of the Hawks.  Unless they get rid of the rotten app les 
within the NPA and the police and the Hawks Chair we are doomed.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe…  
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Major General Booysen I must once again thank you 
for coming forward to help this commission to give evidence and help 
this commission understand some of the things that have happened or 
were happening in the Law Enforcement sector and some of the things 
that some of the people in this – in that sector have gone through.  I 
am hoping that more and more people within the sector who have 
knowledge of things that have been happening will come forward and 
share with the commission and the nation exactly what has been 
20 
happening.  Because as I sa id before lunch if we do not have a proper 
– proper Law Enforcement Agencies then we do not have a country.  So 
it is vitally critical that if there are things that have not been going well, 
that have not been done properly in the Law Enforcement sector we  
should know so that this commission can make recommendations at to 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 169 of 170 
 
what should really be done to make sure that the country has proper 
Law Enforcement Agencies that do their job in accordance with the 
constitution and the law.  So thank you very much for coming forward to 
share what you know.  Obviously this is not the last day you give 
evidence because it is likely that you may be asked to come back and I 
have no doubt you have no problem with that.  So we will still see you I 
believe but thank you very much and others who have similar 
information should come forward and share what they know with the 
commission and with the nation.  Thank you very much.  
MAJOR GENERAL JOHAN WESSEL BOOYSEN :  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADVOCATE VERUSHKA SEPTEMB ER:  Nothing further Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have nothing further.  So for now you are 
excused Major General Booysen thank you very much.

on Law Enforcement Agencies. 
03 MAY 2019 – DAY 88 
 
Page 170 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  Yes Chair we are by no means
