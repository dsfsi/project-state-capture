PROCEEDINGS ON 14 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good morning DCJ.  DCJ this morning we 
are asking that the witness who we were going to be called does not 
appear today.  We probably need two days in any event for that 
evidence.  We ask that you please consider postponing the hearing of 
that evidence to the 20 t h and the 21 s t of September.  It is a Friday and 
a Saturday Chairman.  We have checked with our colleagues who may 
be representing her and they are comfortable with the dates; they have 
10 
agreed to those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  I am fully aware of the reasons for the 
request for the adjournment of the hearing of this witness’ evidence.  I 
am therefore happy to adjourn the hearing of the evidence to Friday the 
20 t h and Saturday the 21 s t September 2019 at ten o’clock on each days 
unless later on I direct that we start earlier than ten o’clock.  So the – 
we will therefore adjourn today’s proceedings but tomorrow we will 
proceed as planned for this week.  Tomorrow as I understand we are 
supposed to hear the evidence from the former Head of the Department 
of Agriculture.

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Thabethe and we will run that hearing 
hopefully for the two days, Thursday and Friday.
