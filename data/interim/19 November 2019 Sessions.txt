PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 NOVEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody. 
ADV NORMAN:  Good morning Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Mr Chairman today we will present the 
evidence of Reverend Frank Chikane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Good morning Reverend Chikane. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Good morning. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Before you Chair you would have what is termed 
Exhibit E4 it is a presentation file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  And that presentation file contains two 
statements of Reverend Chikane.  The one statement is at page 1 to 19 
and the second statement from pages 21 to 22.  His evidence is 
relevant to the evidence of Mr Maseko because Chair you would recall 
that Mr Maseko in his very first statement which was E1 had indicated 
at page – I think paragraph 31 of that statement that he after he had 
gone to the home of the Gupta’s he reported that to Reverend Chikane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  May this be – this bundle then be 
admitted as Exhibit E4? 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 3 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file containing the statement by Reverend Frank 
Chikane and annexures thereto will be marked Exhibit E4. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  May the witness then be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please adMinister the oath. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Frank Chikane. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be 
the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So help me God. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before Ms Norman starts Reverend I just want to 
thank you for making yourself available and for coming to give evidence 
and to share with the Commission your – what you know that is relevant 
to our terms of reference. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 4 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to give your perspectives on some of the issues 
that are really quite important to the Commission and the country.  I 
particularly appreciate that you have come to give evidence because as 
you may know since last year I have been making appeals to among 
others former Directors-Generals and current Directors-Generals to say 
please come forward because there must be a lot that you can share 
with the Commission and – although some have come forward.  I have a 
feeling rightly or wrongly that there are many who probably would 
enrich this commission with matters that they have knowledge of who 
10 
have not come forward.  So I really appreciate that you were able to 
come and share what you know with the Commission.  Thank you very 
much for that. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Reverend at 
page – you will find a presentation before you and it has a divider 
marked 1.1. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Then immediately after that divider you will find a 
20 
statement. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  In fact it is an affidavit and could you please turn to 
page 19 of that folder? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Page 9? 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 5 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  19 yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  19. 
ADV NORMAN:  19.   
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  There is a signature there, is that your signature? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes it is. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. Is it correct that you deposed to that on the – that 
affidavit on the 28 t h of May 2019? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Is that correct, yes.  Thank you.  And then if you 
10 
turn over the page you will find another folder 1.2. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Under that folder there is another affidavit which 
appears from pages 21 to 22. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Could you please turn to page 22?  
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I have got it. 
ADV NORMAN:  Is that your signature that appears on that page? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is. 
ADV NORMAN:  Did you depose to that affidavit on the 24 t h of 
20 
November 2017? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is it. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Briefly Reverend could you please just tell 
the Chairperson what you deal with in paragraph 1 which is basically 
your background and your work experience.  Then we are going to deal 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 6 of 123 
 
then next with your experience having occupied various offices within 
various – or under – servicing under various Presidents of this country 
from President Mandela right up to President Zuma. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Could you then just briefly highlight what do you do 
and all the brief synopsis that you – the synopsis that you have put in 
of your career and your background in paragraph 1. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Thank you.  On paragraph 1 since we 
signed this affidavit I have become a former. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I am now former President of the AFM 
International and former Presiding Pastor of the church in Naledi.  I 
have handed over to younger leaders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And what is still is current is the Vice President 
of the South African Council of Churches the Advisory Committee on 
Peace and Security of the AACC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I am still a Moderator of the Churches 
20 
Commission on International Affairs of the WCC.  That is what occupies 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  For now.  It is voluntary activity all of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 7 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So it is not paid work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In page 2 paragraph 2 indicates the history of 
my work within government.  I happen to have worked during President 
Mandela’s 
time. 
 
I 
went 
into 
government 
1995 
around 
October/November.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And became Secretary of Cabinet during 
Mandela Deputy Secretary.  It was a transitional management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I was introduced to be Deputy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To Professor Germer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then took over during Mbeki’s time as the 
Director-General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And after that of course by Mbeki was removed 
and Motlanthe Presidents – I must say Presidents – former Presidents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I was brought in so I became responsible 
during his time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then I was asked – I was supposed to have 
left earlier.  I was asked to assist with managing transition. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 8 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  From President Motlanthe to President Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that ended my role. 
CHAIRPERSON:    H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  At the end of once we inaugurated them into 
office then I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Of that year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Then paragraph 3 it is all formal so it is just for 
history.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In terms of qualifications there nothing has 
changed. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I am still where we are. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, yes thank you.   
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And let us then deal first of all before we deal with all 
the other matters that you canvass in your statement. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 9 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  With the very issue of – that relates to former DG of 
GCIS Mr Themba Maseko. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Could you just tell the Chairperson without – you 
would recall what happened?  Just in your own words as to how did you 
get to know about the meeting between – or what is it that was reported 
to you by Mr Maseko? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  I have known Themba Maseko over 
histories.  He is quite younger than me but ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  He came into the struggle – we were part of 
that.  Became part of the province of Gauteng Government.  Ended up 
in the National Government as Director-General. Firstly as Public 
Works I think.  Then he became Director-General GCIS.  The way in 
which we structured government at that stage was that we introduced a 
forum called a Forum of Directors-General which brought together 
Provincial Directors-General and National.  And we used to meet about 
three times a year to manage government.  My view was we need a 
public service that can run irrespective of whether or not the politicians 
20 
are there.  You know there is something wrong about our concept of 
public service that the Minister must be responsible for a hospital in 
the Eastern Cape when you have got managers in the system.  And we 
were creating a system that will make sure that even when you have an 
election it should not affect delivery.  And so I worked with the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 10 of 123 
 
Directors-General.  I chaired that forum.  So when Mr Maseko got into 
this challenge – was faced with this challenge it was not surprising that 
he asked to talk to me.  Now when you are Director-General in – you 
never cease to be Director-General and once you have been Director-
General in the Presidency you do not cease to being a leader of the 
Directors-General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So he came to me when I had already left 
government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes.  I thought it is important to say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he asked for advice.  Many Directors-
General still come to me to ask for advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he had been asked to go and meet the 
Gupta’s and he was worried about the implications.  At that point I think 
there were indications there were problems. GCIS would have had one 
of the Gupta’s in their, you know, international marketing entity which 
works with GCIS.  And he came to ask me what he should do because 
20 
the President asked him to see the Gupta’s.  And I said to him which I 
normally do if the President asks you are a Minister to meet somebody 
you cannot say I cannot meet that person unless there is prima faci 
evidence that something is going to wrong.  I said if you do not go the 
President might charge you for countermanding him.  So if I were you I 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 11 of 123 
 
would go. So he went.  When he came back later he said to me, well 
now I have been there and they asked me to do something that is 
irregular in terms of my portfolio.  At that point I said to him, well now 
you have the right to say no.  Because it is about violating the law, 
irregular activity.  I even referred – I normally refer to this section 
which is not relevant to DG’s but it is for the military to say you cannot 
take an illegal command.  If it is illegal say, no.  And so – but also 
understand that once you say no you lose your job.  And during my time 
as Director-General in the Presidency most of those Directors-General 
who found themselves in that situation lost their jobs.  I think they were 
10 
about five or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  During my time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If you have got a problem with a Minister or 
you have got a challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The likelihood is that the DG loses their job not 
the Minister.  That is the – my experience.  So when you take the stand 
you need to then be conscious that there are consequences for you 
20 
personally.  And so he then decided he is going to take a stand.  And 
when he was now asked to deliver and that is the sequence of events.  
It is – you know the mind tends to compact things within a shorter 
period but you realise they happened over a certain period.  He then 
called me and said, I have been given an ultimatum that if I do not 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 12 of 123 
 
deliver I will not be DG by Wednesday this coming week.  It should 
have been about Friday or, you know, Saturday.  And we did not have 
too much discussion because it was just information to say, I am now at 
that point.  Although I did not think it would be dramatic to say they 
would tell you, the Gupta’s will tell you if you do not do what we want 
by Wednesday you will not be a Director-General.  It has not happened 
like that before.  And indeed by Thursday that week he called me and 
said I am no more Director-General of GCIS.  And at that point I said, 
well Mr Maseko we now have enough evidence.  You know you are 
living evidence of this corrupt activity.  This is the time we should then 
10 
take it on.  I did not know at that stage that they were making plans to 
move him to Public Service Administration but he did not last for too 
long and his view at that time is Reverend I am looking for a job now.  I 
do not think I will survive fighting this one and I have to make sure my 
children are okay.  And that is the pain about corrupt activity that it 
costs clean people it costs them dearly.  And at times you get quiet 
because you do not want to be quiet but because of the implications 
and that is where it died off.  Because at that point I thought you could 
then take it on and say I have got evidence that this matter is – has 
happened.  Ja. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  So by suggesting to him that he – this is something 
that he needed to take on were you implying that maybe he could go to 
court and challenge his removal or what exactly is it that you wanted 
him to do at that point? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  If I was asked to do something illegal and I 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 13 of 123 
 
say no and I am told by an entity outside government that I will not be 
in my job by Wednesday and indeed I am not in my job that tells you 
that somebody from outside government runs government.  And that is 
a problem for me.  And that is why I thought you could save the 
government by taking a stand.   
Court it is a problem because it costs money and at times 
people do not go to court because it means you must pay lawyers and if 
you are uncertain about your income tomorrow the likelihood is that you 
focus more on – he is not the only one by the way.   
I have talked to many people who were in the same situation.  
10 
If you did take a stand at that point like some of us did we paid dearly.  
And I went without a job when I was supposed to have a job when I left 
government because an intervention was made to make sure that job 
goes.  It was private sector it had nothing to do with government.   
But a delegation was sent to London to talk to these 
international company to say they cannot give me that job.  If they give 
me that job they have lost their business in South Africa.  And I did not 
get the job.  So it is costly to take a stand.  And many people would 
walk away and see how they survive.  Ja. 
REGISTRAR:  Okay thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can continue. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I have got some questions. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would rather let you ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 14 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me allow you to continue ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. Thank you Chair.  And then at page 21 to 
22 there is a statement that is prepared there which was not meant – 
you did not prepare that one for the Commission because it was only 
done – it was done earlier in November 2017. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is page ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  But what I would like to know – page 21 Reverend.  
What I would like to know what were the circumstances under which 
you prepared that affidavit and where did you file it? 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is for the Hawks. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  How did that happen? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja they knew about this story of Maseko and I 
imagine he had made a statement so they came to me to ask whether I 
could not make a statement.  I said yes.  They came to my office and 
that is how that statement was done. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You know it is the type of statement that you 
talk to the police and they write it for you and then you sign it. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Were you ever called to go and testify at court? 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No. 
ADV NORMAN:  In respect – in relation to that matter. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No it went dead.  It went dead.  Nothing 
happened afterwards. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Would you recall who was leading that 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 15 of 123 
 
investigation within the Hawks?  Do you – can you recall? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No I would not there were four of them from the 
Hawks who came to my office to do this statement and the person who 
then I mean signed here would have been maybe one of them I do not 
know. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But I did not keep a record – my appointment 
book would – calendar would show who it was at that time but I did not 
care to find out. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To follow up.  I mean they told me who they 
were but ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  But I would imagine that when they called you and they 
themselves would have believed that this was a matter that needed 
attention because to them it would have appeared to be some – had 
some criminal elements into it? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  They – I actually thought they were doing 
what I expected to happen at the beginning that the police would take 
20 
on this matter and act accordingly.  So I was pleased they came.  But 
then nothing happened after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was on the 27 – 24 t h November 2017. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 16 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When it was taken, the statement, it seems. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it – would that – would your recollection be in 
accordance with that namely that it was taken on the 24 t h of November 
2017.  Probably you will not remember the exact date but does that 
sound more or less right? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  No I mean I would take it, it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because I mean I signed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  With the dates on so it should be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it should – ja – but your recollection would be 
that it was the end of 2017? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Then we move on 
– is that all that you would like to say then on the issue that relates to 
Mr Maseko? 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja there is not much more.  The – I think that 
is why I then refer to what I have written about what I think and 
understand about what is happening in government.  But I wrote before 
the Maseko matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 17 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But it was quite clear to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That we are on a slippery road. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that this country was at risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And for me it is more painful because some of 
us are living, what would I say, bodies of people who paid a heavy price 
10 
during the apartheid days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Detained, tortured, all sorts of things, poisoned 
and when you see what you had fought to achieve going down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The way it was going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is a very painful experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I always say that I sympathise with the 
20 
veterans who had been passing away 15 years after 1994.  Because 
they go with a heavy heart that that which we sacrificed for.  It is gone.  
And those who passed away the first 10 years were not celebrated 
before they left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 18 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because it was you know – we were busy 
achieving what we sacrificed for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So the Maseko matter for me was an indicator 
that indeed something is radically going wrong.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well on the Maseko matter just in relation to the facts 
here or the details.  One, it has been a long time. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is something that happened in – at the beginning of 
10 
February 2011. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the actual transfer – his transfer from GCIS to 
the Department of Public Service and Administration. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The meeting that he has said he had with Mr Ajay 
Gupta had happened.  I believe if I recall correctly sometime during 
October of 2010 and he had a meeting with Mr Ajay Gupta at the Gupta 
residence on a particular day in October 2010 and then later in the 
same month he said he had a telephone conversation with among other 
20 
people Mr Ajay Gupta on a certain Saturday when he was on his way to 
a golf competition in North West. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With his wife and Mr Ajay Gupta according to Mr 
Maseko was insisting that there should be a meeting – he should agree 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 19 of 123 
 
that he would meet I will simply say Gupta people. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it would be people who may have come from 
the New Age I am not sure or one of their entities to meet them on the 
Monday morning and Mr Maseko was saying no those people must 
phone me on Monday and then we can look at whether I can meet them 
on that day.  But he was insisting that he should agree there and then 
that there would be a meeting.  But he says in that telephone 
conversation ultimately Mr Ajay Gupta effectively said to him, I see that 
you are not co-operating with us and I will report you to your seniors 
10 
and you will be sorted out.  Or something to that effect. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Hm 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was – it was the end of October and of course 
November, December and then January beginning of February then the 
transfer happened.  
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am just mentioning this particularly to indicate 
part of his evidence but also to say it is quite some time back and 
therefore maybe one can expect that the recollections of details might 
not be the same.  Now one of the important or two of the important 
20 
things which I have picked up from your statement is that it would 
appear that on your evidence he, that is Mr Maseko, spoke to you about 
the President’s call to him prior to him going to meet with the Gupta’s.  
On the evidence he gave as I recall he said he got this call from the 
President as he was I think leaving the building on his way to meet the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 20 of 123 
 
Gupta’s. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which might not have given him time to meet with you 
before. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before.  But of course if he spoke to you on the 
phone rather than meet you maybe he might have spoken to you on the 
phone on his way to the meeting.  I am not sure.  So I am just drawing 
attention to that one to say maybe I know there has a long time just 
reflect and see whether you think you are quite clear that happened 
10 
before the meeting or it happened after or whether he just spoke on the 
phone.  But also quite an important aspect is from your statement is 
that you say that he, Mr Maseko, told you that the Gupta’s or Mr Ajay 
Gupta I do not know if he was specific about names to you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that he had been told that if he did not comply or 
co-operate he would not be DG by Wednesday. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now I do not remember that in his evidence he 
gave that part.  My recollection is that what he said was the last time 
20 
he spoke to Mr Ajay Gupta on the phone was towards the end of 
October. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Gupta said to him he would report him to his 
seniors and he would be sorted out.  And then he says on the day on 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 21 of 123 
 
which he was actually transferred from GCIS to DPSA which happened 
to be a day on which cabinet had a meeting I think it was a Wednesday 
on the 2 n d of February 2011 he says on that day interestingly he saw a 
missed call from Mr Ajay Gupta’s phone but he says he decided not to 
return the call.  But it occurred to him why is this person phoning me on 
this day when I am being transferred. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In circumstances where had previously said I would 
be sorted out. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he leaves it at that.  So I am just giving you this – 
because also you might not have listened to his evidence.  You might 
not have read his statements.  Just to give you what his evidence is.  
At least as far as I remember and to check with you whether you feel 
quite confident that one, he spoke to you before he went to see the 
Guptas and two whether this issue about him saying to you either 
Mr Gupta or the Guptas have said if I do not co-operate or comply I will 
not be DG by Wednesday.  Whether it is something that is quite clear in 
your mind ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because on the face of it one would have expected 
him to remember that part. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of his evidence quite – it was quite 
important, but as far as I remember he did not mention it.  So I just 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 22 of 123 
 
want you to think about that and see how clear your recollection is 
about that. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Chair, I – you know I have got a good example 
about how the brain works … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because June 16, 1976 the first event was a 
Volkswagen car of the police burning and then June, the 16 t h happened.  
I always thought it was a day before.  June, the 16 t h ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I only discovered recently when we did 
10 
research that it was two weeks before.  So in a sense ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  As time goes by ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The brain tends to compact …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Put it within a ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Shorter period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But in terms of my interaction with Maseko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is that I did not – I was not privy to.  It is like 
a film. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 23 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I am – the people who watch it know what is 
happening the other side, but I am a player in it.  I do not know what is 
happening the other side.  So I would say it – I cannot say whether or 
not he talked to me during the time he was going to the Guptas after 
the President called him. 
What I know and it is possible that they would have had 
discussions with the President.  He would have been asked to go and 
see the Guptas.  I have a sense that he would have talked to me before 
that.  Simply because it was a real discussion.  It was not a telephone 
call.  If you look at the statement ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I did for the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Which is earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 21 Chair. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  We have – it is – it says: 
“The President requested him to go and meet the 
Guptas at their house.  I advised as requested.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually before that ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Maybe you should ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually before that.  I do not know whether it is 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 24 of 123 
 
actually before, but at the first line of paragraph 3 ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Says: 
“You received a call from Maseko requesting a 
meeting.” 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I received a call from Maseko requesting a 
meeting ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Seeking advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So it must have happened before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The one of going to the Guptas and the 
President calling.  It is an operational matter ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Which would have been additional to what 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Was happening ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But he consulted me when ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  He was relaxed ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he wanted to get my opinion. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 25 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I suspect it happened before ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before.  Okay.  Okay. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then once he had gone to the Guptas.  I do 
not know at what stage, because they talked a lot with the Guptas in 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  At what stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  He came back to me and said ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  This is what they are asking me to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  He did not give me the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  He just said it is irregular. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is against the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  This is what I suspected ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then I said to him now this is the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Then the third ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 26 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
Must 
have 
been 
during 
that 
Friday 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Saturday ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Which I only knew after he gave evidence 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I have no idea ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But the only thing I know is that he called me 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And said you know I have been told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That I do not do what they want me to do 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  By Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So it must be that week ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Which was critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It might have been months after the first 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 27 of 123 
 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I have no idea ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But he said they say ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  By the Wednesday I will not be DG 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
And 
usually 
the 
DG 
of 
Government 
10 
Communications does the press conference after Cabinet on Thursday 
and on Thursday I do not think he did the press ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  I think ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Briefing ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he was gone. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he called me ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To say I am no more DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Whether he called me on the Wednesday after 
20 
Cabinet ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Thursday. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Or Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but it was after ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 28 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The decision had been made. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But from my point of view I remember well.  I 
cannot – it was too dramatic to forget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Not the details about days etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
But 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
talked 
to 
me 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it cannot be marginally fair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You know.  It is something concrete. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the idea that he said he had been told he will not 
be DG by Wednesday. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That part is also part of the drama. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Very clear in my mind ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because that is what shocked me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it happened. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  I mean if you are told by a Minister or the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 29 of 123 
 
President that you will not be DG by Wednesday.  I can understand 
that, because it is in their hands to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But if somebody from outside ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Tells you, you will not be DG ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  By Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Then there is something serious irregular. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  The paragraph that the Chairperson 
referred to you which is paragraph 3.  Where did that meeting take 
place between you and Mr Maseko? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Now you see I do not remember. 
ADV NORMAN:  You do not remember. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think it was at my home. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I do not remember ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because I was not in Government at that time. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 30 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  We could have met in the office ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Or he would ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Either have come to me or ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But the first interaction was not just – it was a 
10 
call to ask for a meeting and we met and talked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
Which 
is 
different 
from 
all 
the 
other 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Things that followed ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In that regard.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Then we move onto matters that 
you, you categorise as published material on the subject of the 
Commission and you ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 31 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  Sorry sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to round off ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  On it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this.  So you say after he had been to the Guptas 
and had a meeting with them ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he came back to you.  He did not tell you details 
of what it is they talked to him about ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or that they wanted him to do, but what he did say to 
10 
you is that they wanted him to do something irregular? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the position? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  That is irregular, illegal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And illegal. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Something he cannot ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  He could not ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If he did ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  His integrity would be at stake. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In fact ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I have said too many public servants, because 
they are the ones who signed the documents.  It is not the politicians 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 32 of 123 
 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  When they ask you to do it, it is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be careful. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is your head ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  On the block ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because in court it is the person who signed 
...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The document ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
And 
so 
it 
is 
the 
official 
who 
really 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Gets ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Compromised ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In this.  There is also another thing Chair about 
the Public Service Rules.  There is a provision in it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That says if a Minister asks you to do 
something irregular you must ask the Minister, because at times 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 33 of 123 
 
something irregular may not be illegal ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But you must ask the Minister to put it in 
writing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In writing.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  There is a provision ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But all the DG’s ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I advised ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Lost their jobs after asking the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So it is a provision that is there, but it means 
that you lose your job ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because once you ask the Minister put it in 
writing.  That is the end of our job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You will not get it in writing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know before Ms Norman deals with the other 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wider issues that you are going to deal with.  I am 
interested in the issue of other Directors-General that you have 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 34 of 123 
 
mentioned that you know lost their jobs after you – after they refused to 
do irregular things ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I am wondering whether wherever they are 
they do not feel that that is something that the Commission should hear 
about ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not know Reverend.  We all know many 
people in this country and I am sorry to say this, but that includes you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who suffered a lot ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the struggle for freedom who were prepared to 
sacrifice a lot of things. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  A lot.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did not care if they were beaten up by the 
police. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did not care if they were detained for years.  
Who did not care if they could be hanged and wanted to ensure that 
20 
there was freedom ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that this country could be a better country than it 
was under apartheid ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 35 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were prepared to operate on the basis that 
they will not have any income. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will not have flashy cars. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will not have mansions ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they were committed to this particular 
cause. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now some of those and you are not – you are not 
involved ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that part.  Some of those in terms of what one 
reads over the years what is in the public domain have got themselves 
into serious matters of crime, corruption ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And doing things that are very much contrary to 
serving the people for whom they were prepared to sacrifice so much 
before ...(intervenes). 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you think about it.  You do not understand how 
somebody who ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
For 
so 
many 
years 
was 
prepared 
to 
die 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 36 of 123 
 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just so that the people of South Africa could be free 
and because he or she wanted to serve those people.  How they could 
turn around ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And want actually to steal from the very same people.  
That is what one reads in the newspapers in the public domain. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In court cases and so on and so on.  So I ask myself 
10 
the question when people and some of them are people who were 
involved in the struggle know of things that should be put before this 
Commission. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that this Commission together with the people of 
South Africa can try and see what may need to be done to sort things 
out.  To make it a better country. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they do not come forward ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say I know something that will help this 
Commission to consider recommendations that can help our country.  
When they do not come forward you wonder.  You have difficulty 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 37 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course one does not want to say anything that 
may be interpreted to mean that one does not appreciate that 
sometimes people find themselves in a situation where they think about 
their families. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They think about their children.  They think about 
what could happen to them and which could result in them not being 
able to provide for their families and their children and so on.  So one 
says what one says, but there is that in mind as well, but just one 
wishes that in – there could be a way ...(intervenes). 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of which people could really come forward 
and say look we really want to go back to that kind of commitment we 
had before, because this is not the kind of country that we sacrificed so 
much for.  We want it to be what it can be. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I am saying these things to you.  You might not 
be able to say anything, but I am saying them in the hope that maybe 
you might be able to throw some light.  You can see where my difficulty 
is. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
mean 
I 
think 
of 
people 
who 
sacrificed 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a way that you cannot describe in human words. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 38 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For freedom.  For a better South Africa, but here we 
are there are allegations of State Capture. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are high levels of corruption in the country.  
This Commission has been put together to look into those issues and 
come up with recommendations which could help and there is still 
reluctance. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Chair, I – it is a very difficult subject.  I mean it 
is a subject on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think I have reflected heavily on it.  In one of 
the second books there are things I could not say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  There is a chapter there where I deal partly 
with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think firstly I always say that our struggle 
20 
produced extraordinarily people.  You know the Mandela’s.  The 
Sisulu’s are not products of – are not accidents of history.  To find the 
system we were fighting you had to reach a stage where you are ready 
to lose everything.  It is – it was a choice between life and death really, 
but put it difference we had to make a choice about what type of death.  
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 39 of 123 
 
You knew you were going to die. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So we used to talk about a useless death 
where you die without – not resisting the system ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Or die resisting the system ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And people made that choice ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But that choice was costly and I do not want to 
10 
bring family matters here, but there is a stage when I was in detention 
every six months.  The family could not access my accounts 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And in 18 – 1982 I think when Dr Aggett died I 
was in the same corridor.  Dipale died in the same corridor, 
John Vorster, and then they allowed our families to come and see us 
and I signed my powers of attorney to my wife, because they could not 
run life.  So it means I decided I am no more useful to the family and I 
thank God that she took care of the family, but the sacrifices we had to 
20 
make were huge. 
What I am hearing from comrades I talk to, because I have 
talked too many.  Say no it is not the same.  During that time when that 
happened somebody will take care of the family.  Even if it is small 
monies, but you know there is – the struggle was – had support.

CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Today you are alone.  You are on your own.  If 
you lose the job today and there is no food at home ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is nobody who can help. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja and the corrupt lot do not want you.  They 
support those who collaborate with them.  Those who are not corrupt 
also do not want you, because when I left Government and I did not 
have the job which I had arranged ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I could not serve in boards.  Once they see 
your name.  They see risk for your company ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In relation to Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So you are actually on your own ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I think that is where the challenge is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The challenge is. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The second part of it – the other side of it 
which is more problematic for me is that not everybody who was in the 
struggle really was about justice and I must say – it is in my book as 
well.  Very risk statement to make.  Apartheid was just too bad.  I mean 
it was so bad that you had to fight it in anyway. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 41 of 123 
 
You do not have to be committed to justice and when you get 
your chance you do exactly what they were doing because they were 
denying you to do it in anyway.  They excluded you from business.  
They excluded you from – so you fought to get a chance ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But it was not defined in terms of justice and 
so are that a shock myself of comrades who find – who are found doing 
things that just are despicable.  I mean it is something you would not 
imagine they would do, but then I realised no.  Our commitment was not 
or the same thing.  I think the risk for me – I have talked to a number. 
10 
They say if I go now – if I lose my job what do I do with my 
children.  I have got a bond.  I have got this ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And nobody cares. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think that is where we are at …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where the challenge is. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it requires people who would – ja.  Do 
what a young theologian who visited the Nicaragua and came back, 
because Nicaragua experienced the same. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You were free today and tomorrow you are no 
freer again and it talked about being crucified for the second time.  You 
know.  That you were crucified.  You paid a price.  Now you must pay a 
price again ...(intervenes).

REVEREND CHIKANE:  It ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It becomes difficult. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  It is difficult ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it is only people who really I will call 
Mandela …(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.

REVEREND CHIKANE:  Who have committed to death ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And still understand it in the same way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think that is a ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where the challenge is. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If I make example of those who came clean 
who wanted to change Government during our days we were 
20 
transforming Government.  We were transforming the State, but when 
the five years comes to a close they realise they have not achieved as 
much as they thought and they are going to be gone after the elections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Then they – their personalities change. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190

CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.

CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  By looting ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that also tells you the democratic system 
itself creates a situation where people then they reinvent themselves to 
something else.  So it is a subject of concern and the younger 
generation is saying why should we sacrifice.  We understand you had 
10 
to sacrifice, but why should we do it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I think it is a serious concern for 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Not only this country by the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It affects ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Many other countries. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  H’mm.  No.  Thank you very much. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And so for those DG’s Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 44 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Those who left paid a price and found a space 
somewhere.  They would not want to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You know.  It is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  They want to move on. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  They want to move on ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But some of us would say, but so what happens 
to what we fought for and suffered for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I would rather die fighting for it to make sure 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And indeed by 2015 ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Some of us were operating like we were in 
1986. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I was not able to park my car which – in a 
placed where it is not attended to.  I cannot go to a mall and park my 
20 
car ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And if you started living like that in a new 
South Africa then you know ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 45 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That you are in another space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  So not many people would want to 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To go back to that.  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes and that was about the five DG’s.  
Maybe you should consider whether whatever was done to deny you a – 
the job that you had got or were about to get. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is not connected with what the Commission 
is looking at.  So that if it is it maybe that it is necessary to – if you are 
prepared to look more into it, but – to the extent that it might involve 
people’s names, because I do not think you talked about it in the 
statement.  I do not remember seeing it. 
It may be necessary that there be a supplementary statement 
or affidavit that would deal with it because some of the witnesses who 
have come before me have made the statement that part of what has 
been 
happening 
is 
that 
those 
who 
are 
against 
wrongdoing 
...(intervenes). 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were being punished. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would be suspended for no good reason in their 
jobs.  They would be dismissed.  They have got to incur legal costs to 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 46 of 123 
 
get their jobs back.  They will be charged criminally and then maybe 
the prosecution would collapse or the charge would be withdrawn, but 
they say some of those people who were co-operating with wrongdoing. 
They would do wrong things and nothing would happen to 
them.  They would – you would do maybe a small mistake and then it is 
a big thing, but with them they would do big things and nothing happens 
to them.  So it is important to see – to get as much information and 
evidence about those things as possible insofar as they fall within the 
terms of reference.  So I am just mentioning to you that ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It maybe that it does fall within and if it does I would 
be quite interested in it, but to the extent that it might involve people’s 
names.  It may be that it is something that might need to be dealt with 
in a separate statement, but it might be something that you might wish 
to reflect on.  I am not sure. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Chair, it can be done.  There are case 
studies.  I would call them case studies ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Or specific ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It can be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be done.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The – in my case, because ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 47 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I went public.  I always believe ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
Your 
best 
product 
– 
protection 
is 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And so in then – the things that could not be 
said …...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The first ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  There is a chapter there at the beginning that 
deals with the implications of taking that stand ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And also including how your children get 
affected.  Your brothers and sisters.  You know the family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Comes to you and says we are suffering 
because of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And you cannot protect them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If – one of my brothers said you know I am part 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 48 of 123 
 
of a consortium.  We applied for this and when they saw Chikane there.  
They said to the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  They said no. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Consortium if you have that Chikane – it does 
not matter who it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You will not get it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he had to be thrown out ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Of the consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So the costs are – you know it is a ripple 
effect.  It goes further than yourself, but yes.  I mean ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  For instance this issue about my job.  I plan to 
leave Government.  I was not dismissed.  I applied and made 
arrangements.  They asked me to do transitional management for 
six/seven months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I had to delay taking that job ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In January and ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Plan to take it in July to finish with this 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 49 of 123 
 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And the company agrees ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
And 
then 
during 
December 
they 
were 
approached ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And by January I did not have that job.  So in a 
sense you can document these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   The only difficulties that for this DG some of 
them if you say Minister put it in writing that’s the end of your 
relationship.   By the time the President appears it is a negative 
relationship between a DG, not about that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   And then you leave because of that negative 
relationship.   So it is not as easy as it looks like, but the Maseko case 
was so clear for me, that’s why I thought we could ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as I see it, it is quite important that this 
Commission when it finishes its job should try as far as possible to see 
20 
what can be done about such things, because going forward there may 
be challenges in trying to stop corruption or reduce levels of corruption 
significantly if the perception created in the country is that if you stand 
up for what is right you are gone, and nothing will – that will be the end 
of you. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 50 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are we going to have in the future who would 
stand up, who will our children have to stand up when we are not there 
because they will look back at what happened to so and so and so and 
so during our time and say we did they end up, so I am not ending up, 
who will stand up for our grandchildren when they are grown-ups in this 
country when wrong things happen, because people will look back and 
say we can tell you as many names as you are prepared to hear of 
people who tried to stand up, and they were finished off and that was 
the end for them. 
10 
 
So it seems to me that it is quite important that if at all 
possible this Commission and the people of South Africa should try and 
help it to say what is it that we can recommend that will encourage 
people who want – who are opposed to wrongdoing that will encourage 
those people to stand up because there will be proper protection for 
them.    
 
I mean sometimes it is not just losing a job in the public 
service, as your experience tells you, well you left at the time you 
decided to leave but you had made arrangements with your future 
employer and then ultimately didn’t get, but I think what one hears in 
20 
the public domain is that even when you are not employed within the 
public service what can happen is that if you are a business person 
your businesses might suffer. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   It gets affected yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, if you stand up for what is right, so you end up 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 51 of 123 
 
with everybody who knows something is wrong being afraid to stand up, 
so the question is what do we do to strengthen the protection of people 
who stand up for what is right.    
 
I have spoken, and you may have heard I have spoken in the 
past about the effect that I would like to look at, and we are looking at 
that, the question of how has Parliament exercised its oversight 
obligations over the years, how come we have such high levels of 
corruption, what have they done to hold to account the executive, to 
make sure that there is not as much corruption in various government 
departments as we have.   Are there challenges with members of 
10 
Parliament doing their job properly? 
 
Are the mechanisms of oversight effective?   Maybe the 
mechanisms are fine, the problem may be the commitment or 
willingness to go far in exercising oversight on the part of various 
individual MP’s, maybe also because of our parliamentary system, our 
system because to be in parliament I need to be – my name must be in 
the list of a party and maybe if I am going to take a certain line that the 
party doesn’t approve I am jeopardising my chances of continuing to be 
in parliament or of a promotion to be Deputy Minister or to be Minister, 
to be Chair of a Committee. 
20 
 
If we have all of these things how do we  correct them so that 
for the future members of parliament would be able to exercise their 
oversight, their functions properly in the way that they should and 
therefore maybe make sure that levels of corruption are reduced 
significantly and that those within the executive who are not doing their 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 52 of 123 
 
proper job you know are held to account, there are all of those things 
and maybe with all of them that is always the element of fear if I stand 
for what is right there may be consequences and I will be alone after 
that. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   Ja but maybe the Commission I mean can I am 
sure part of their recommendations could go in that direction, but there 
are two things that you have referred to, it is the electoral system, 
everybody  now agrees that – not everybody, it is not scientific, most 
people now agree that our electoral system, you know the proportion of 
representation was meant to make sure the minorities are represented, 
10 
that’s what it was meant for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   But it has turned to be something else, the 
party decides whether you are in or out and therefore you lose your 
right as a person to be yourself.  That is the one thing, but I just want 
to say another thing is the economic setting in the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   In normal time, and you know during the time 
in government I went to visit different governments, the systems, the 
way they work, in NED ...(indistinct) democracies where like in the 
20 
Nordics people go to government not because they need money, but 
they go because they want to serve, they already have money, they 
have got assets, if you told them to do something they will tell you well 
I am leaving, I don’t depend on government.   
 
I think in poor countries the problem is that those who are poor 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 53 of 123 
 
who  happen to be the ones who fought the struggle, are the ones who 
have no assets, have no reference point, if something goes wrong I am 
gone, and so to deal with the problem we need to go beyond just fixing 
the laws and the constitution.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   To fixing the economy, because as long as the 
people who are going to government are people who are unemployed, 
have no business, they have nothing, no assets, no inheritance from an 
uncle or father or mother you are – it is you and you alone, and if it 
goes wrong it has gone wrong – if it goes wrong you are on your own. 
10 
 
I think that it is part of the challenge, so people take 
advantage of that go say okay if you don’t do it we are going to do the 
following to you, but if you had your own assets it wouldn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this is what sometimes comes to my mind in 
regard to members of parliament, and I just share with you so you can 
also comment; that if for argument’s sake we had a constituency 
system then if I am a member of Parliament and I am opposed to 
wrongdoing, I want to hold to account a Minister or the DG’s and the 
President, the Deputy President, I believe what is being done is wrong 
and I really don’t want to be party to this and I am a member of my 
20 
party.   
 
If my party was against me doing what is right but I know that I 
might not get a promotion to be Deputy Minister, to be Minister, or 
Chair of a Committee but my continued presence in Parliament depends 
on my constituency and I know that my constituency wants me to stand 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 54 of 123 
 
for what is right, I think I would be encouraged to say its fine, I might 
not be Minister, I might not be Deputy Minister but I will still be able to 
look after my family and my children, because I know the constituency 
that I represent will re-elect me, they are happy with the job I am 
doing. 
 
So sometimes I look at it that way and say that maybe that 
would ameliorate the situation of MP’s who want to do the right thing 
but feel that under the current system they are too vulnerable, because 
they can be removed by the party and then they will be gone.   
REVEREND CHIKANE:   I agree. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   I think that’s the push now that we need to do 
maybe a mixture of what we do at local government level, where we 
have got a mixture proper ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   Constituents so that you still take care of the 
minorities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   But in a way in which people can be able to 
take a stand. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes, yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:   And now they are vulnerable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.   No thank you very much. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair, I see it’s now about 11:15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we have taken quite some time, but I think it 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 55 of 123 
 
was important. 
ADV NORMAN:   No it was Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is quite important the Reverend was in government 
for a long time and he has been a community activist for a long time, he 
knows what is happening in South Africa. 
ADV NORMAN:   No, true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will take the tea adjournment, it is about 
quarter past, and then we will resume at half past. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we can proceed. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that we will find that the discussion we had 
earlier is very much part of the discussion that is still to come in regard 
to what is in the books and so on.  It is very connected I think. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  So it is – ja. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Maybe whilst finishing 
off the issue of Mr Maseko could you just tell the Chairperson when did 
you get to know about the Gupta family and in which Presidency was 
this and you could just take us through. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 56 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  That ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No I do say in my statement. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because I realised this issue about the Gupta 
family and when you met them.  It is critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I thought I must reflect it in my statement 
firstly that part of the younger members of our family was interested in 
IT World and they ended up in Sahara Computers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sahara yes. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sahara Computers. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I – and then I imagined they picked up that 
they are …(indistinct) and then they talked about me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then thought I would have interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In knowing what their mother was doing in 
terms of social welfare, helping the workers in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Would I want to meet her.  Now you know I am 
– I do agree to meet people who are doing good things.  And so I ended 
up with the Gupta’s meeting UMama and I heard about the story.  And it 
was like any of the stories of meeting somebody who is doing 
something good which is very interesting.  And later – the next – at that 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 57 of 123 
 
time there was no such suspicion.  I had no knowledge of the Gupta’s. 
The next was when we had a state banquet and normally state 
banquets it is about 180 people it is very tight.  Even CEO’s of State 
Owned Companies and Chairs do not come at the same time.  We get 
the CEO then another time we get the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because the space is tight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And suddenly when I did an audit for this state 
visit I saw that there were three surnames – three people of the same 
10 
surname and in my audit you know I just – protocol gives me the list 
and I just look at it and I picked it up and I asked what this was about.  
Why do we have these people?  And because at least if there is one it 
is okay.  If it two maybe you invited your partner but if it is three it is 
unusual and so that is how I got to raise the question Protocol Team of 
course felt bad.  I am the Director-General and I said how did you end 
up here?  And they said no it is one of the Ministers who asked them.  
And I said but you know it is irregular.  You cannot do that. And I 
realised I am putting the ordinary staff under pressure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I decided myself to talk to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I could not stop it because it is a day before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It would be very dramatic. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 58 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But I had to talk to the Minister and say you 
know please do not put my Protocol Team in difficulties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that is where it ended.  I had no – I did not 
even link up the first incident and this one it was just names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And later I learned that one of the Gupta’s 
served in the IMC, the International Marketing Council.  And then of 
course the video that social media shows of Mbeki making a speech in 
10 
the launch of this film which they were part of in terms of I think 
financing etcetera.  Even then it did not occur that there is a problem 
until when I dealt with the Maseko issue and then I realised there is a 
problem.  So I thought I must state that so that for the record and I do 
conclude in my statement that it looks like when you look at all the 
other people and families who got affected this was not an accidental 
activity it was targeted intelligent more than I would expect of a family 
that arrives here.  Just – I do not remember whether it is 1994 or 
whatever would have actually had so much contacts it just does not 
make sense to me.  And I concluded it must have been an intelligence 
20 
operation.  They knew exactly what they were doing and then pick up 
Chikane, youngsters to get to me.  It could not have been an accident.  
Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this would have been around about obviously 
before 2011 before the Maseko incident but – ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 59 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It was at the time when ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much earlier? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much earlier. 
ADV NORMAN:  May I direct Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are able to remember more or less? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja it is ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  May I direct Chair around 2007 that appears at page 
15. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is about 2007? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  And there was I think Mr Ajay Gupta was a member of 
the IMC since 2006. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja that is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But my – the earlier first encounter would have 
been much earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes and I had no idea who the Gupta’s were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Were all about.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  So then we ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 60 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second. 
ADV NORMAN:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Yes.  Thank you.  So then we have 
dealt with that part now.  Let us just in your books, the two books that 
you append. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  You deal with in Chapter 9 of the 9 Days in September. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Correct.  In Chapter 9 of that book. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  You deal with the conflation of party and state. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  State ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And the questions that – some of the questions that 
the Chair had put to you they may relate to what happens when there is 
that conflation of the two institution and then what are the 
consequences? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Of that.  Could you just elaborate on that? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The – well I always Chair say that there I had 
20 
an advantage that I became part of the Electoral Commission so I could 
not be part of the government 1994 and spend time at Harvard doing 
studying about governance.  So it gave – I always say I had an 
opportunity that others did not have.  It gave me a break as well after 
all this.  And you could observe when we started – when I went into 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 61 of 123 
 
government that this – there was still the old order or the new order or 
they are in the same place.  And the old order intelligence guys were 
still reporting to the old order that is outside government.  And the new 
order was also still reporting to their commanders outside government.  
And when you looked at it you knew it was a risk for the State because 
you do not have an intelligence security system that is reporting to the 
State.  It means the State itself was not operating outside.  And you 
can see why that type of thing happened.  So I do say that there were 
signs during our times which we should have read and would have 
explained this to us.  So on the question you were asking ma’am it is – 
10 
I do talk there about the signs. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I am talking about it in paragraph 13 that 
the ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph 13 is at page 5 Chair. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The Intelligence Officers continued reporting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And definitely you could see that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And when we dealt with the crisis within the 
ANC because I was in the NEC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And also Secretary Cabinet and DG in the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 62 of 123 
 
Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I had a window to all of what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And you could see that by the time we hit 
Polokwane and the issues of President Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  There was within the intelligence system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  People who reported to different – they were 
10 
not reporting to the President only but reporting elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that is a threat to the security of the State.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You cannot have a state that functions like 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The second issue I refer to here is in 
paragraph 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Which is the using the powers of the President 
to stop prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That when I talked with the corporates in 
government. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 63 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It was clear that when we were confronted with 
Mr Zuma being charged who was Deputy President but then ceased to 
be Deputy President.  This language about the State prefers charges 
against means that the Head of State is the one who – it is for the 
ordinary people.  It is the Head of State who was making the decision.  
And they believed that the Head of State can intervene and say, no do 
not do it.  And if it is people who are at higher levels who believe that, 
that tells you that we are vulnerable in a sense and we should have 
seen the signs and signals.  The third example I make it is the 
10 
Nicholson Judgment.  You will remember that judgment which was 
thrown out in Bloemfontein.  It was a bad judgment.  I did not have to 
be a lawyer to – and my name also appeared there.  So to say we were 
all part of this problem.  Cabinet decides to appeal.  I am Secretary of 
Parliament – Cabinet and there were people who were unhappy about 
the appeal within the leadership of the rule – the Governing Party.  And 
they were of the view that it should not happen.  So the first thing they 
tried was – because I was asked if it is classified information then it is 
of Cabinet.  The Secretary of Cabinet writes an affidavit to confirm this 
decision was made.  So the lawyers needed that.  I was told I cannot do 
20 
that.  Because it is in the – because it is my job to do it.  Secondly it is 
in the minutes.  So somebody said no but the minutes are not approved 
yet you can change them.  Now or any leader to ask Secretary of 
Cabinet to change minutes of cabinet it is a very serious matter and my 
response, and it is in my book, my response was, The Cabinet meets 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 64 of 123 
 
every second week.  Those who do not like this decision you are in the 
majority.  It was after Polokwane.  Just go and rescind the decision.  
You cannot ask me to change the minutes and so they do not rescind.  
So I have to do that affidavit for the lawyers and I was given 
instructions not to do it.  And I – that is part of the costs I paid because 
I said well I have to do my job.  And President Motlanthe at that time 
was the President.  So I went to him and said, Sir I am told the 
leadership says I cannot do this affidavit and you are part of the 
leadership.  And he looked at me and said Moruti do the right thing.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was not just the President of the country at 
10 
the time he was Deputy President of the ANC as well. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So for me if somebody comes and says the 
leadership says I say, well you are also a part of the leadership so give 
me the instruction not to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  As President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And he said, no do what is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And what the law requires you to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I did that affidavit and those who know 
would know that I was accused of being part of those who are against 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 65 of 123 
 
President Zuma because I did that affidavit.  It is my job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But that tells you that the law did not matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  What matters it is interests that people have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Norman. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be quite fine if it is convenient for the 
Reverend to read this part of his statement. 
ADV NORMAN:  Of his – yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he can stop. 
ADV NORMAN:  Elaborate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As and when you might have questions. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After certain paragraphs. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or read and then at the end questions can come so – 
because it is really more about analysis of ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Of what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of certain situations yes. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Then may he then start reading from 
paragraph 17 because what he has just told the Chair appears in 
paragraph 15. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 66 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine Reverend? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Paragraph 16 I say that for me what mattered 
was the law and the constitution, anything else would border on 
corruption of the law to serve the interests of some members of the 
party.  My compliance with the law cost me dearly within the party, that 
is the ANC and as regards my future therein after.  So it is those types 
of incidences which as you exercise your responsibility you seem to be 
10 
against people when in fact that is not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know it is quite an important aspect of your 
evidence because as I see things even though one separates the ruling 
party from government. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a certain reality about certain things.  That 
is why somebody who is a member of parliament who may have taken 
an oath that includes if I am not mistaken now. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That includes putting the interests of the people of 
20 
South Africa above everything else in that capacity.  I am not using the 
actual wording of the oath but I think there is something along those 
lines.  Putting the interests of the people of South Africa or the interest 
of the country where they might feel that – I think what is good for the 
country is (a) but maybe that is not what my party thinks. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 67 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do I do here?  Which is what we were talking 
about earlier? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now it may be that it becomes relevant to say – to 
look at how a party that is the governing party might deal with people 
whom it perceives – who it perceives to do things not the way it wants 
them to deal with certain things. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it punish people for doing their job?  Should 
10 
that be allowed? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The values – the kind of society, the kind of country, 
the kind of government that the party itself proclaims it wants is that 
the kind of situation that it endorses?  And if some – if things like that 
do happen what does the party do?   Or does it live like that – leave 
you like that even if what is being done to you might be contrary to the 
values that it proclaims itself?  Or its own – even its own constitution.  
What does one do?  To what extent can one ignore maybe certain 
practices or certain things that may be done by the ruling party when 
20 
they affect people who are in government?  So I am just sharing with 
you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thoughts that come to mind from time to time.  I do 
not know if you – I am just saying. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 68 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you – when I read – when I hear you give 
evidence about this I am just concerned you know with a situation 
where the ruling party, your own party might punish you for doing your 
job. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to what extent do those types of practices on the 
part of the ruling party affect corruption – influence corruption, promote 
corruption?  To what extent may they have contributed to State Capture 
or may they have created an environment which made State Capture 
10 
possible because people who wanted to say stop this, stop this felt 
they could not say so because they would not get the support of the 
party. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they could even be punished.  Those are some of 
the thoughts that come to mind and you might or might not be able to 
say anything. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja in a normal – I do not know what is normal 
society definition.  In a normal society and democracy the party would 
not act in a way that would intend violating or breaking the law, 
20 
constitution deliberately.  In a normal society. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Unless there are people who are captured 
there for other purposes and then of course they would behave in a 
very strange way.  And people do make mistakes.  I mean the President 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 69 of 123 
 
would come to the office after Monday they have been at Luthuli House 
or during some earlier times Shell House and would come and propose 
something.  You know.  But I would see my job as that of firstly 
protecting the President.  Making sure we act constitutionally.  
Fortunately we had a good lawyer and I will look at what is being 
proposed.  Even if it comes from the party.  Because then people who 
propose it are not experts in law constitution.  Then we would say to 
the President, no Mr President we have thought about this.  There are 
serious implications and the Presidents I worked with would then say, is 
that case ja, okay, do not do it.  You know what I am talking about?  
10 
Because it not like a deliberate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It might be just because people feel in a 
particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In this particular case I make the case that the 
risk for the State which is in paragraph 17 if you could allow me to say 
that I say in the book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If this level of corruption of the system – 
20 
because you are corrupting the system it is not just individuals had 
been achieved it would mean that the integrity of the State would have 
been totally compromised.  And a faction in a party or another entity 
would effectively have taken control of the State.  Because they run it 
from outside.  And this would be the birth for me of a dictatorship.  That 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 70 of 123 
 
is how you end up with a dictatorship and a country controlled by mafia.  
You know there is a time when I had to start in the Italian mafia and 
found it very interesting.  You know they take you from police, the 
prosecution authority, the political class and ultimately the judiciary.  
Once they get the judiciary then you are all gone.  Because then they 
can determine who goes to jail, who does not go to jail and that to me it 
is what defines a State Capture in that regard.  So a party – a normal 
party should not make decisions that suggest you ignore the law.  It is 
– and indeed when they come to me I would say like on corruption.  
President will make a statement of the ANC or January 8 every year we 
10 
are against corruption.  So I say well that is the position of the party.  
That is why you will not find me fighting with a party.  That is not the 
issue.  The issue is the leadership who then use their positions to 
achieve certain objectives.  So I will always ask there is nothing even 
within a let alone government within the ANC that says you should be 
corrupt.  There is nothing.  And therefore you can ask me and if you 
say the leadership says so I must – who are these leaders, in which 
meeting did they make this decision?  If you ask that question it will not 
be answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where it ends. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is where it ends. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is why fortunately I was in the President’s 
office and the President always it is either President of the party or 
Deputy or – so I can go to the President and say, President this is what 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 71 of 123 
 
they are asking me to do?  And I do not think that it would be within 
official positions of the ANC and they would say, ja you are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And therefore take the position.  But there are 
not many people who would have that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You know even a relationship with a President 
where you can engage and say, this is what I believe in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And so the – if you could allow me in 18 
10 
because it explains. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  This that in the worst-case scenario the whole 
of the cabinet and its Presidents are compromised and syndicates 
operate without any fear.  Because they will not be arrested.  At this 
point the citizens have lost their government and I am quoting in the 
book because I wrote it before all that you see here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You could actually predict it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that since the government now serves the 
interest of a particular syndicate or mafia and not those of the people.  
So once it is norm where a government of the people then we do not 
have a government.  Because it is not serving the interest of the 
people.  Then I add that I continue to say that business too may 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 72 of 123 
 
compromise government and I do refer in some other parts where the 
Browse Mole Document which was – were asked to investigate because 
I chaired the National Security Council Committee.  And without going 
to classified information but we found that there were businesspeople 
who targeting specific Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And if you have got a good intelligence service 
they will know that.  That is businesspeople who are trying to corrupt 
Ministers.  And you need to deal with that matter because otherwise it 
compromises the State.  And at that time I was asked well talk to them, 
10 
the relevant Ministers.  Now it is because I had a relationship with them 
which is not – it is historical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I can go to the Minister and say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You know this is the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Please watch it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: Businesspeople always work on the basis of 
20 
how they capture the State to serve their interests.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. Well I want to say this before you proceed so 
that I do not forget it.  I do not recall whether the ruling party has taken 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 73 of 123 
 
a position officially whether it says it itself had a problem of being 
captured or of certain important leaders within it being captured or not.  
I do not know whether it has taken that position.  I have no 
recollection. But I think about it from this angle that where we are 
looking at the allegations of State Capture in this commission one of 
the things we are looking at is we must try and establish how it came 
about. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it did come – if it did happen, because we have 
been asked to investigate allegations of State Capture. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the end of the work of the Commission I must make 
findings whether it did happen and so on, but if I find that it did happen 
or maybe it might not be the same version as may have been seen 
elsewhere in the world or whatever ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have to look at how did it come about. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened?  Who could have avoided – who 
could have taken steps to make sure it did not happen. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It did happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did happen. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What should be done in the future to make sure it 
does not happen again, but if – assuming that the ruling party – current 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 74 of 123 
 
ruling party might still be the ruling party for a long time to come 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within Government the State might do whatever it 
might want to do if the ruling party was captured or if important leaders 
or some of its leaders were captured and as a result it itself did not do 
what it may have – it was supposed to do to try and avoid and stop 
State Capture or stop the levels of corruption that have happened in 
the country ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it has not had that introspection and has not taken 
a stand it could easily be – there could be a repeat within the party 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it happens within the party and if it is still a 
rule – the ruling party at that time it could happen to the State. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just thinking about that.  Of course you 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are a senior you know leader within the ruling 
party.  So I am just thinking that you know there is that issue and I 
wonder to what extent they may have started looking or they plan 
looking within inside or not. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Well I am no more inside.  I am not part of 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 75 of 123 
 
the  
CHAIRPERSON:  You are no longer in the structures. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  National Executive.  Ja.  The National 
Executive ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But all the decisions of the party would be 
against corruption ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And therefore by implication cannot allow a 
State to be captured.  The debate is what I think it is why you have this 
10 
Commission ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because there are those who say the State was 
not captured ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And there will be those who say it was captured 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it is how you show that indeed it was 
captured. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Now my analysis which was before the 
Government of the last 10 years or so which is in my books was 
indicating that there is a risk.  So the risk was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 76 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It was clear ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it would happen if you do not stop it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Now the only thing I can say is that now that 
they declared me that I am now a veteran.  I meet the requirements of 
60 years and 40 years of service.  We have had a National Consultative 
Forum – Consultative Conference on this matter and recommended the 
organisation that they need to reflect deeply.  Not just in terms of what 
Commissions do ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But they themselves ...(intervenes).

REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because it is their organisation ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And the documentation is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It was a conference before the ...(intervenes).

REVEREND CHIKANE:  In 2017 I think.

CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Voices which are saying ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  There is something wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is because this is very simple.  If you get 
compromised – that is how I was trained during the struggle.  It does 
not matter whether it is money or person – your personal life.  If the 
person who compromises you can run your life ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Can come back and say we want you to do 
something ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And if you say no they say you remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You did the following ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then you realise the person behaves in a 
strange way.  Now in the things that could not be said.  I have 
published a document that I sent to the President.  Fortunately it was 
20 
not classified, because it was at the party level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So I could publish it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And indicated that there are people amongst us 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 78 of 123 
 
who have been compromised in history. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It might have happened 20 years ago 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And now they become Ministers ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And the people who know that come to them 
and say ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  We would like you to do the following. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If you do not do it we will tell the ANC what 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  You have done ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then of course ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  They behave in a strange way. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I think that is how a State gets ...(intervenes).

Page 79 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In – it is ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  More dramatic of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Where the State is so weak that you could 
actually take it over ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And make it do what you want. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  No.  Thanks. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say in regard to the fact that as you say 
you know the policies would be clear within the ruling party.  You know. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are against corruption and so and so on.  You 
know the challenge is not so much to find decisions and policies that 
says no to corruption.  The challenge is to find the will ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To fight the corruption indeed rather than what people 
simply say. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I very often say that even with this Commission you 
will find lots of people who will publicly pronounce how much they 
support it ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 80 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But some of them you know ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  They do the opposite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So even with the ruling party the challenge will be 
whether they will be planning to do something much more than just 
have on paper that we abhor corruption blah, blah, blah, blah. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Okay. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you.  You deal with the matters that 
the Chair raises in paragraphs 20 and 21 ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  But could you just summarise, because they were – 
that is when we are dealing with businesspeople.  How business could 
corrupt those who are in office and you deal with that in paragraph 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Page?  Paragraph? 
ADV NORMAN:  I beg your pardon.  Page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that I said he can – he could read 
20 
...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I have been having questions. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am quite happy ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 81 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am quite happy if he reads up to the end and then 
...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Then ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deals with questions after. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is going to be convenient. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you Reverend? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph 20. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just read from ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So go through the ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Go – and then questions will come after. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If that is the case I will go to paragraph 19. 
ADV NORMAN:  19 first. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And say that ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Things that could not be said.  I make a point 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 82 of 123 
 
which is concluding this corruption matter. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  “Corruption is devastating.  It can 
compromise leaders to such an extent that they 
abandon their mission to serve the people and instead 
serve their own interests or the interest of those who 
have compromised them or those who know that they 
have been compromised.” 
I think it is important because it is – once you are 
compromised you cannot go back.  You are captured in a sense and 
10 
then in the rereading of the scourge of corruption I make it clear that 
we understood the challenge the country was facing before the worst 
happened.  In page 224.  I indicate that that private sector players 
which is what I was referring to. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Private sector players were always ready with 
bags of money to compromise the leadership and I have in bold there. 
“There were a set of wealthy highly placed intellect - 
international and national businesspeople who targeted 
the leadership of or potential future leaders.” 
20 
They did not just target those who were in power, but 
potential.  If they see you are rising up they target you. 
“In this regard the involvement of strategically placed 
senior comrades gave members of these networks a 
sense of invisibility, because if the leadership then gets 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 83 of 123 
 
captured then you know that nothing would happen to 
you whatever you do and the practice a certain 
credibility – in practice a certain credibility.  It gives 
the …” 
So what is wrong becomes credible in a sense to do and of 
course I referred here to a warning I gave - paragraph 21. 
“To the governing party based on experience as a 
deployee of the ANC and MEC in the North West 
Province.” 
When I was there, there were young people who were 
10 
organised to disrupt the meetings.  Especially if you are about to make 
a decision that is not in their interest.  They will come and disrupt the 
meeting.  You actually realised money was being spent to even get 
them drunk overnight ready for this type of activity the following day 
and ...(intervenes). 
COURT:  To be disruptive? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be disruptive? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  To be disruptive ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I then in 22 I conclude by advancing a 
view that – a view about what is called political corruption which I say 
is more than – more toxic than the traditional understanding of 
bureaucratic corruption, because political corruption gives you space to 
do what you are supposed to do whereas bureaucratic you use the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 84 of 123 
 
bureaucracy to try to find whatever you would want to achieve and I 
reported this, because I am a deployee in North West. 
So I reported this to the MEC.  So you will have documents 
that indicate that there is a problem within the party and there are 
people who are doing these things to achieve their own interest and for 
that 
reason 
the 
law 
and 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
falls 
off.  
Businesspeople fund these groups so that they can get tenders once so 
and so gets elected. 
So the problem starts from the ground up into Government.  
By the time these leaders arrive in Government they are already corrupt 
10 
and they are there for other purposes than what it is meant to be.  That 
would take you to ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  The interface.  Yes.  There you deal with how many 
Ministers ordinarily got appointed.  How they got into Cabinet.  That is 
one of the things that you deal with in page ...(intervenes) . 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  From paragraph 24.  Could you just outline the 
paragraph ...(intervenes)? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Page – paragraph 20. 
ADV NORMAN:  I was just saying at page 10 Reverend you deal there 
20 
with how ordinarily – we deal with separation of powers. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And then you also deal with how Ministers get 
appointed.  Maybe you could just – so I take it that when you deal with 
this process you deal with it during President Mandela’s time. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 85 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  During President Mbeki’s time ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Mbeki’s time. 
ADV NORMAN:  And finally during President Zuma. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Could you just take Chair through that process?  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Unfortunately with President Zuma I was 
with him when he was Deputy President. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So he was not President. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  When he became President I was out of the 
system.  What I am – the point I am making is that because I was in the 
MEC in Government Cabinet I had a window through the system and I 
was not involved in appointing Ministers, but I understood that when 
the President appoints a Cabinet and I was the one who got the list 
before they knew to be informed for – to come and be – meet the 
President. 
The President would consult with the Secretary General of 
the party, because the Secretary General of the party is not 
20 
appointable.  The – it is the only one who is not appointable.  The rest 
are appointable as Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So he would not consult ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 86 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Anybody except ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja, but that consultation for me would be this 
thing about in consultation with and after consultation with that you 
consult, but the President has the constitutional responsibility to 
appoint a Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has the final say? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Has the final say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It cannot be the party that dictates that.  If you 
10 
are sworn in President you have the final say.  Whatever decision you 
make you cannot blame the party ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because you have the final say, but the risk is 
that you have to then balance things up which are more related to party 
– you know there are Ministers you appoint because you are balancing 
– you know there is a ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certain party interests? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Party issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Party issues.  Ja. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And they could influence the way you – 
although it is still your decision ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But it could influence who you appoint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 87 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Not based on the safest these people would 
offer ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But it might be based on the balances that you 
need to achieve which can work and that is where the deployment 
policy becomes a problem as well and I will not have to read it.  Just to 
have explain that we managed during my time this Deployment Policy. 
If you have got somebody you think can do well that is – 
there is nothing wrong, but we apply – we advertised the post 
...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that person must apply ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And we will have a panel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like everybody? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  If they are the best. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Then they will get the job ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But they are not going to get it because they 
are just coming from the party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
Then 
you 
impact 
negatively 
on 
the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 88 of 123 
 
administration where you have people who may not be able to do the 
job and service delivery suffers etcetera and so forth and so the State 
is always at risk in terms of the relationship between the State, the 
party and the Government, but the Presidents I worked with I mean 
particularly President Mandela and President Mbeki. 
It was short with President Kgalema Motlanthe.  It was like 
six months.  Understood the differences and so Mbeki would say I am 
now speaking as Head of Government not party not Head of State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Oh.  I am speaking as party and now I am 
10 
speaking as Head of State.  It is a very important differentiation.  So 
that when you act as Head of State the party could not dictate to you 
what you need to do which may not be in the interest of the State or the 
people of South Africa, because the interests of one group could work 
against the interest of the rest of the people of South Africa and the 
Head of State must be there for the people. 
Not even just for those who voted him in power or her in 
power, but the Head of State must be there for even those who do not 
like him or her.  So it is – the differentiation is very critical and so I do 
deal with it in that chapter.  I have not taken it ma’am paragraph by 
20 
paragraph, but ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, but you just ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is just to make the point. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So the risks will always be there.  It is how 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 89 of 123 
 
strong the President is.  What support he has in the party and, but the 
President cannot abdicate responsibility to the party and this is where 
the resolutions of Polokwane are very challenging, because they say 
the centre of power is not in the State.  It is in the party and once you 
say 
that 
it 
means 
the 
President 
is 
a 
figure 
head 
whereas 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The decisions will be taken at the party level. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you mean when you say that. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And you implement at Government level.  My 
10 
understanding is that the centre of power for the party is in the party.  
The centre of power for the State ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The State.  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  It is in ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is not in ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  A party ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And if we – I dealt with it.  Party will have a 
manifesto and we watch which party is likely to win.  We look at the 
first three.  Study their manifesto.  Once they win you must translate 
the manifesto to policy and it is a technical professional job 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 90 of 123 
 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And if you do not handle it carefully.  You end 
up – I do not remember which paragraph ma’am about that poverty. 
ADV NORMAN:  It is on page ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  You deal with it, paragraph 31. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  31, yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Page 12, but you – I think you – yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Where I make this example.  It is very 
10 
interesting, because the party does the manifesto.  When they finish 
they use the machinery of Government when they are in Government to 
translate manifesto to policy, because parties do not capacity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  They may say it is policy, but you know policy 
has got more detail.  You may find that what you thought is good 
purpose policy.  When you go to the details it does not work like that.  
So you then do that, but in the transition between President Mandela 
and President Mbeki we managed that transition in such a way that 
there was no gap. 
20 
In 
the 
transition 
between 
President Motlanthe 
and 
President Zuma, because of the decisions in Polokwane the planning 
was done at the party headquarters.  I was still there, because I was 
handling the project and I watched – if you read that paragraph 31 
...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 91 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  It is at page 12 Chair. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Up to page 12 – up to page 14.  I will not read 
it.  I will just summarise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is fine.  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  We had this war on poverty and we – research 
told us poverty in urban areas is becoming deeper.  Even compared or 
worse than rural areas, because the poor people who are unemployed 
the farming does not work.  They end up in the city and there is deep 
poverty. 
10 
So we developed a policy on war on poverty for rural and 
urban and when I hear this debate in Alexandra about urban renewal 
and they say what happened to the money.  I say they should ask us, 
because we planned for that, but when the takeover in 2009 happened 
the good comrades were really thinking very well.  Thought poverty is a 
rural matter. 
They moved war on poverty from the President’s Office which 
we said it must be at the centre, because it deals with every 
department.  They moved it to rural development. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So because when I left Government I used this 
policy.  I believed it works.  Get society to be involved with Government 
– civil society – multiparty.  You know.  Everybody.  Then we found that 
it has been moved from the President to Rural Development. 
I went to Rural Development and the DG – DDG then did not 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 92 of 123 
 
know what to do with this, because what does he do with urban renewal 
in Alexandra or Soweto and then six months later they redeployed all 
that staff from the President’s Office who went to Rural Development to 
do rural work ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And suddenly there was nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the townships and Alexandra ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They fall outside of the program now? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes and it tells you that if you do not manage 
10 
the relationship between the party and the State.  You are likely to 
make very disastrous mistakes that are not intentional, but just happen, 
because of the way in which you handled this relationship.  That 
relationship can lead to corrupting the system if it is not managed 
properly and I think that explains that …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So money might – that might have been intended for 
both rural and urban ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might have ended up working only for rural. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But it would have been better if it did, but I do 
20 
not think that money ended up there.  I think that is part of the 
problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That is why in Alexandra they are debating 
where did the money go to ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 93 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And nobody is answering this question 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But if they ask us who were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I would be able to tell them ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The renewal happened this far ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And something happened ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And then nobody now knows where. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I am just making an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So it is critical to have managed the 
relationship in a way that respects the Constitution, because it is our 
Constitution.  It is not somebody’s Constitution. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And you deal Reverend with the war on poverty right 
up to paragraph 35. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:  You have summarised it.  Well unless there is a 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 94 of 123 
 
particular point that you wish to highlight in those paragraphs, but I 
think you have covered the gist of what you wanted to convey to the 
Chairperson there. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I am – I mean I do conclude there that: 
“As a result and notwithstanding available information 
that poverty had become deeper in some of the major 
cities in the country.” 
Page 34. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Paragraph 34. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  34.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  “The war on poverty program was 
moved to the Department of Rural Development.  This 
cut off the urban renewal development part of the 
program.” 
ADV NORMAN:  Okay.  Thank you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it may not be obvious, but the failures of – 
in the townships becomes part of the problem and people would not 
even remember that you had a problem like that and ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I mean I go through them in terms of the 
issue about giving the one proved pilot study in Soweto which is the 
one that we were doing. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  This program suffered and said in this the 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 95 of 123 
 
agreement signed with the department.  The Government failed in the 
process. 
ADV NORMAN:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  That takes you to 35. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And then we have already dealt with the Gupta matter 
and how you met them. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  We have dealt with that. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  We have dealt with that, but then there is and 
10 
you also dealt with the Maseko matter, but I think there are paragraphs 
which I think you might want to place on record, because they deal with 
sort of the summation of what you have observed insofar as this whole 
Gupta family issue is concerned. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  And if I may take you there to page 18 ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Because I believe you have observed the proceedings 
of the Commission at some point and, because you summarise it and 
you deal with it at paragraph 47, but please tell me if you want to go 
20 
...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  For record I can do that.  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  I think 47 does – yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I say: 
“With evidence that has come to the attention of this 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 96 of 123 
 
Commission and the public I am now …” 
Which I have said earlier. 
“I am now convinced that the Gupta family was not an 
accident of history.” 
You know.  My observations. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  “The effort to reach out to me and many 
others directly or through family members such as that 
there was more intelligent operation to reach out to 
leaders who were strategically placed or had the 
10 
potential to occupy strategic positions in the future or 
their relatives including their children and create 
relationships or corrupt them in preparation for a larger 
project to capture the State and use it for personal gain 
or for the benefit of those collaborated with them.” 
And in 48 I say: 
“If such an intelligence operation was in place I would 
have been surprised if our National Intelligence 
Services would have missed it.” 
I know I have worked with them.  They should have known.  If 
20 
they did not I would say that we had no intelligence services.  That 
would be the implication and thus very vulnerable as a country if 
anything like this would happen over such a long period and you miss 
it.  Then you are very vulnerable as a nation. 
My expectation is that the intelligence agencies must have 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 97 of 123 
 
had this information.  Except that it would be within the realm of 
classified information.  Public information we have now is that two key 
senior intelligence officers did report this matter to the President, but it 
did cost them their jobs.  That is my information and it is public 
information. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  For the purposes of this Commission there 
should be a legal way in which this could be confirmed, because it is 
very important in terms of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Did we have knowledge of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  What is happening? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I would be surprised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I worked with these teams in intelligence.  
There are weaknesses ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But they would not have missed something like 
20 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm.  Well there are going to be witnesses 
who will testify before this Commission in due course probably before 
the end of the year who previously occupied senior positions within the 
Intelligence and I have reason to believe that they will throw some light 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 98 of 123 
 
on these issues.  Ja.  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you and thank you that is the end of the 
statement and we have touched on the chapters in your book as you 
were summarising.  Is there any particular aspect that you would like to 
highlight which you might feel that maybe I have omitted which you 
would want to mention to Chair which is perhaps contained in your 
references? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  I picked up the references Chair 
...(intervenes). 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  From the book, because it is quite – they 
elaborate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  By the way the first book Eight Days In 
September cost me dearly as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well is it – the job that you told me about only 
or there is much more? 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  There is – I think it is – there is much 
more about the job ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is much more. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And other things ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But in terms of just writing the story 
...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 99 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It was not welcome ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Because you – and as I am saying I was very 
careful.  I was – if you read my books carefully I am – it is not about 
the party.  It is about leadership and if you get leadership – if the 
leadership gets compromised then of course the party becomes a 
victim.  So I do not have more to say.  I just extracted ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Some of the elements ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And details ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the book. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  In the book which...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
REVEREND CHIKANE: 
 
I 
mean 
we 
could 
spend 
more 
time 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  On them, but I did not think that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It would help the Commission.  It should suffice 
now to say that I think although we saw the signals.  The State and 
party were not able to arrest it, because we could have arrested this 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 100 of 123 
 
process and it was not and it cost the country dearly and something 
needs to be done to make sure we never, never ever end up in that 
space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja and I did not talk about there, because the 
VBS it is a recent thing.  I actually looked at it.  I talk to Motau who did 
this report ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Became clear to me ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Same problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  The leadership – whoever this leadership is 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Says we are going to change the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  So you can put money there ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But they do not change the law ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  But they put the money in anyway and the DG 
signs.  He signed the documents ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 101 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And I say before you sign any document you 
say now which laws are affected.  Before I sign anything which laws are 
affected?  Have you met this requirement that requirement and if they 
did that none of the money of the Local Government would have been 
put in the VBS Bank in terms of the law, because they had not changed 
it, but people do not – if the leadership whoever this leadership is says 
we are going to change the laws so you can put money there.  I would 
wait and say where is the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Where is the change in the law first? 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja.  Where is the change in the law 
...(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Before you risk people’s money? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that was not done because there is no 
respect for the law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  People think they can run Government without 
worrying about the law ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And that is a pitfall that would destroy our 
future ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  And the sooner – we have got the laws. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 102 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is not like they are not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  It is the disregard and if you are compromised 
you cannot even raise the question.  Ja.  That is all I would like to say. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think one has heard of situations where people 
have said when something illegal or irregular was about to happen and 
a leader said it must be done and somebody said no, but it will be 
against the law.  One has had situations where it is said some leaders 
10 
would say do not tell me about the law. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This must be done. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is a serious situation when any leader says do 
not tell me about the law.  You know.  If you have that situation and it is 
confirmed as true it is – it would be a serious situation, but one has 
heard stories ...(intervenes). 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the public domain and elsewhere, but of course 
20 
even when that does happen so often people know what the law is. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People know what is right. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  People know what is wrong ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 103 of 123 
 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they do what is not right or they are instructed to 
do that is wrong and they do it.  Ja.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Just to authenticate copies that 
were made I would – the references that you made Reverend in your 
book.  If you could just turn to the divider marked 1.3. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  1.3? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes.  That will start from page 23.  That is the extract 
from the Eight Days In September. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes and those are the extracts from your book.  I just 
want to authenticate it and then – those and then also from The Things 
that Could Not be Said.  That will start from page 50. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes and of course the Chair has been favoured with 
the actual copies of the books. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
ADV NORMAN:  They are – they have been placed before the 
Chairperson.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not know whether we – the Commission bought 
20 
these ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  We ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether we ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 104 of 123 
 
ADV NORMAN:  They were bought by the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certainly I have been reading some portions ahead of 
today, but the one on Eight Days In September I read it some years 
back. 
10 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot claim to have read the whole of it, but I read 
I think a substantial part of it.  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I – so I looked at the attachments. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  I have got the books in my bag, but they look 
authentic. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
REVEREND CHIKANE:  They look very authentic.  It can be 
…(laughing). 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  That is the 
evidence ...(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 105 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  From this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reverend thank you very much once again for having 
come to give evidence and to share with the Commission your 
perspectives and observations on some of the matters falling within the 
terms of reference of the Commission and some of the things that 
happened in our country and for your views.  We appreciate it very 
much.  Once again thank you very much and you are excused. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  We have the next 
witness Chair.  I …(indistinct) we still unless you would prefer them to 
10 
adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time do we need to start with the new 
witness? 
ADV NORMAN:  No.  That witness should not be a long witness at all 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I mean to start.  How much break do you need? 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  To start with that witness.  No Chair.  If Chair 
says we could take the lunch now then we could – we could start at – it 
is 12:45.  I am not sure whether ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...(intervenes). 
20 
ADV NORMAN:  I am following the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was thinking ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you need five minutes or 10 minutes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  Just to set up for that witness. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 106 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV NORMAN:  Oh.  Yes Chair.  We will – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe we can use ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:  Five minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can use 15 minutes before we take the lunch 
break. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
ADV NORMAN:  That is alright.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So five minutes will be fine? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Five minutes Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  (Intervenes) adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn then for five minutes. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are you ready?  
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair, yes we are ready.   Chair in front of 
you, you would have a presentation file which is marked Exhibit D9 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 107 of 123 
 
which has the statement of  Lieutenant  General Yolisa Matakata, in 
fact it has got two statements from her and we will identify them after 
she has been sworn in.  May that be admitted then Chair as Exhibit D9, 
her evidence relates to the evidence Mr Mcebisi Jonas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the file containing the first statement you see is 
that of Mr Jonas. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes I beg your pardon Chair, it will be under 2, the 
divider marked 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but since this is about her, her one should have 
been on top. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  On top, oh yes, it should have been the other way yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should have been the first one to see when you 
open the file. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see now if I say I have to say statement 
containing Mr Jonas’s – the file containing Mr Jonas statement and that 
is not about him. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is going to be difficult to change it. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:   No Chair it can be changed because we can see – we 
had put in Mr Jonas’s for reference purposes so that can be – we can 
simply take that one out and then what is number 2 will be number 1, it 
will be easy, it will be easy to change the index, that can be done with 
ease yes. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 108 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I will say the file containing the notice of 
motion and affidavit of Major General Lezintle Luticia Nonope will be 
marked as Exhibit D9. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you Chair, might I ask for a slight 
amendment to that Chair, that we term it Exhibit D9B that of  Lieutenant  
General Matakata. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that, I’m sorry. 
ADV NORMAN:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat what you have just said. 
ADV NORMAN:  That Chair instead of chair naming General Nonope 
10 
that Chair names it as Exhibit D9 to be the statement of General 
Matakata. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I think I ...(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think it comes from the fact that her statement 
is not at the top, if it is at the top that makes it easy, but also this 
might not be the only file where there is a statement by her because 
there might be another one from which you got this. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes Chair, but – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file marked Yolisa Matakata containing among 
20 
others an affidavit by Ms Yolisa Matakata will be marked as Exhibit D9. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just for the future the first statement should be 
that of the witness who is giving evidence then. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, thank you Chair.   We will rectify that. 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 109 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair, may the witness be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL YOLISA MATAKATA:   Yolisa Matakata. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have an objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you regard the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes I do. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your right 
hand and say so help me God. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   So help me God. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you,  Lieutenant  General is it correct that you 
are currently in the employ of the South African Police Services and 
you’re holding the position of Lieutenant General? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes that is true.   
20 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, could you please just look at the file that is in 
front of you and turn to page 35 of that file, it is two pages, 35 and 36 
and do you see there’s a signature at page 36? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes I can see it yes. 
ADV NORMAN:   Is that your signature? 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 110 of 123 
 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   That is my signature. 
ADV NORMAN:   Did you depose to that affidavit on the 22 n d of August 
2018? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes I did Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you and then could you please turn to page 
84, there is a signature at page 85 it’s also a two-page statement. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:   Affidavit, I beg your pardon, did you depose to that 
affidavit on the 18 t h of November 2019 which is yesterday? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes I did Chair. 
10 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, thank you now after you had – this statement of 
yours, it is common cause that it formed – it served before the 
Chairperson as C1 because it was attached to General Nonope’s 
statement but in your statement you deal with a telephonic conversation 
between General Ntlemeza and the former Minister Mcebisi Jonas, 
could you just tell the Chairperson where are you based within the 
police service? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Thank you Chair, I am based at 
the Directorate for Propriety Crime Investigation which is located at 
Silverton it is the head office of the DPCI as it is referred to. 
20 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes and what is the – do you have, as a Lieutenant 
General is there a specific position that you hold within that 
department? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   I’m a Lieutenant General in 
terms of the rank of the Police and in the DPCI I am the Deputy 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 111 of 123 
 
National Head. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes and what sort of matters get referred to your 
section?     
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  In the Directorate for Propriety 
Crime 
Investigation 
we 
investigate 
corruption 
related 
matter, 
commercial crime related matters and also organised crime matters. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes how long have you been within that section?   
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   I am nine years within the 
Directorate now.  
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, within that Directorate yes and if you could turn 
10 
to page 35 because that’s where your first statement is.  
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  I am there. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, you say you can’t recall the date when there was 
this conversation you were at General Ntlemeza’s office.  Could you 
just tell the Chair in your own words what happened at that meeting and 
your recollection of the events? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:    Okay, Chair I was in a meeting 
in General Ntlemeza’s office and with me was General Ntlemeza and 
General Nonope.  There were two meetings but I’ll first refer to the first 
one.  In the first one it is where General Nonope raised the concern 
20 
with General Ntlemeza that she has been trying to get hold of the 
Deputy Minister then Mr Jonas for him to depose an affidavit in relation 
to an investigation that was within her environment and she requested 
General Ntlemeza to intervene and maybe try and get hold of the 
Deputy Minister himself.  On being informed about that General 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 112 of 123 
 
Ntlemeza immediately called the Deputy Minister who responded 
immediately to the call.  General Ntlemeza indicated to him that 
General Nonope who has been assigned to this matter is really looking 
for him and is raising a concern that she’s been trying to get hold of 
him to depose an affidavit.  The Deputy Minister then asked, what do 
you want from me as the Hawks because I’m not a witness, I’m not a 
complainant, I didn’t open a case and therefore I’m not going to give a 
statement.  So General Ntlemeza had to explain that this is – there are 
two cases that have been opened by a Mr Mayne from the DA and Mr 
Bloem from the COPE and these are related to his, I think, interview in 
10 
the media about being at the Gupta household and therefore this is why 
he is looking for him and he is a witness to that effect. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes and then what was the – how did that conversation 
end? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:    He agreed that he will meet 
with the General but subsequently, if I may continue …(intervenes). 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the subsequently, you were not on the phone 
with Mr Jonas, General Ntlemeza was. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   How come you heard what they were saying was 
there – were they speaking on – did Mr Ntlemeza put the phone on 
speaker? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:    Yes Chair, what happened was 
General Ntlemeza put him on the speaker and therefore that is how I 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 113 of 123 
 
could hear the whole conversation and also what would be Mr Jonas’ 
response to the issues raised by General Ntlemeza. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you and then you say – sorry could you 
continue, you were going to continue before Chair asked you the 
question, yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:     Yes I then would like to refer – 
because this was the first call that was made by General Ntlemeza. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Then I’m not sure and I can’t 
recall after this call when did General Nonope …(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry again, I just want to be sure.  In summary, 
was the conversation between General Ntlemeza and Mr Jonas to the 
effect that General Ntlemeza said to Mr Jonas, General Nonope who 
has been assigned to this investigation has been looking for you and 
then General Ntlemeza wanted to see what could be done to make sure 
he was available to meet with General Nonope.  Is that what – the gist 
of what he was saying to him was? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes that is gist Chair, what 
General Ntlemeza was doing was to just indicate the frustration, if I 
may refer to that by General Nonope of not getting hold of the Deputy 
20 
Minister to meet and get a statement from him.  So therefore General 
Ntlemeza was intervening in that regard and indicating to him that he 
has to meet with her and explaining after the Deputy Minister wanted to 
know but why must he meet that he’s not a witness, he’s not a 
complainant in the matter so why must he give a statement, that was 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 114 of 123 
 
the gist of the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the gist of how the call ended was what I know 
you were asked this, just repeat that please. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes the Deputy Minister didn’t 
object when he was informed that General Nonope is the person and 
has been looking for him to submit this statement to her.  So he didn’t 
object, he said, no it’s fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the conversation end simply like that or did they 
talk about the way forward what would then happen for General Nonope 
and Mr Jonas to meet? 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   No there were no discussions 
further on that particular day when this first call was made in my 
presence that how would they meet and when there was no such 
discussion …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it was just left on the basis that the Deputy 
Minister was saying it’s okay, in other words he was agreeing to meet 
with General Nonope. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   That is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s how you understood it? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright continue. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you and then was there a second conversation? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   There was a second call that 
was made sometime after which I cannot recall how long after the first 
call but again we were in a meeting and after the meeting General 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 115 of 123 
 
Nonope raised the concern again, frustration, that she has tried even 
after the first call that was made in my presence to get hold of the 
Deputy Minister and he’s not taking the calls and had sent messages to 
him.  Then General Ntlemeza again took the phone immediately, his 
phone, and he called the Deputy Minister who responded immediately 
to the call and again he indicated, General Nonope is concerned and 
frustrated because she’s been looking for you and – to take the 
statement that we had referred to earlier in the first instance that I was 
present when he mentioned this call.  So the Deputy Minister said, no 
it’s fine and he indicated that you must come to the office and you 
10 
would be meeting with General Matakata and General Nonope where 
they can have the statement taken from you. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes and then did the Deputy Minister come? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe – is that how that telephone conversation 
ended? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:     Yes that is how it ended, he 
agreed that he would come and the statement would be taken from the 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was the arrangement in that telephone 
conversation that the Minister would come to the offices of the Hawks? 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:    That is how it was arranged 
Chair, that he will come to the offices of the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes was a date arranged during that conversation? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   There was no date arranged 
Chair and my – it would be my assumption that General Nonope would 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 116 of 123 
 
have had a follow up with him to make the necessary arrangements of 
the date when to meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, during that second telephone conversation 
which you witnessed, did the Deputy Minister indicate why it was that 
General Nonope may have experienced difficulties in getting hold of 
him? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  No there was no such was 
raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No such? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay continue. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you Chair, and then – so did you ever – 
because now you had been – General Ntlemeza had indicated that the 
Deputy Minister would meet with yourself and General Nonope.  Did 
you, yourself make any attempts to reach the Deputy Minister to have a 
meeting with him or did you – how did that work out? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   No I didn’t because it was not 
my investigation as such because it was already mentioned that 
General Nonope is the person and that would be making the contact 
with the Deputy Minister.  So mine was to wait for a date from General 
20 
Nonope that is confirmed that we will be meeting with the Deputy 
Minister. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes so did that meeting take place? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  It never took place Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, thank you and then at page 37 …(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 117 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry the fact that you were going to meet the 
Deputy Minister with General Nonope was there a particular reason why 
you were added or is it normal that there will be two officers dealing 
with an investigation? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  Chair I think at the time maybe 
General Ntlemeza just wanted to demonstrate – because being a 
Deputy Minister there would be two senior people that would be 
meeting with him.  The mere fact that even the matter was handled by 
General Nonope not maybe junior members I think it was maybe just 
courtesy and showing respect at the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:   Thank you, Chair the time is now 13:00 I’m not sure 
whether Chair would like us to finish this witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was thinking maybe we should go up to ten past or 
quarter past, what do you think? 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair, maybe we do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s do that ja. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you, then General at page 37 there is a 
letter that is signed by yourself but you signed it on behalf of General 
20 
Ntlemeza, could you just turn to page 38, is that your signature? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  Yes that’s my signature Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:   And that letter is dated? 
LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL 
MATAKATA: 
 
 
The 
letter 
is 
dated 
…(intervenes). 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 118 of 123 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry you talk about a letter and are you talking 
about page 87? 
ADV NORMAN:    37 I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   37? 
ADV NORMAN:   37 yes and the signature is on 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You sticking to the red numbers hey? 
ADV NORMAN:  To the red numbers, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I see it now. 
ADV NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  What – first of all did you write this 
letter or did you simply sign it? 
10 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  No I signed the letter it was not 
written by me. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, and why did you end up signing it and not the 
person who was the author of the letter? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  I was called by General 
Ntlemeza Chair and requested me that I sign a letter on his behalf that 
would be – that he would have signed but he was not in the office at 
the time so he requested me to sign the letter on his behalf, he’s aware 
of the contents in the letter. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, what was this letter all about, I see it is 
20 
addressed to the Speaker, House of Assembly, Parliament Cape Town 
and addressed to Honourable Ms Baleka Mbete, what was the letter 
about? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  The letter was a request to the 
speaker of Parliament, Ms Baleka Mbete at the time to intervene due to 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 119 of 123 
 
the non co-operation of the Deputy Minister in the investigation that the 
Hawks were busy investigating at the time, after it has been arranged 
several times to get a statement from him.  So the request was for the 
speaker of Parliament to intervene because there’s not been any 
positive response from the Deputy Minister at the time. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes, and I see there’s reference in paragraph four of 
that letter that there was a letter or communique that had been 
addressed to the Minister are you aware of that, on the 6 t h of March 
2017? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  Sorry is it paragraph? 
10 
ADV NORMAN:  Paragraph four of that letter at page 37. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA: Yes, I’m not aware of the letter 
because I was not part of the investigations Chair but it is obvious that 
there is correspondence to that effect and as evidence in the docket of 
the investigators. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, General this affidavit together with the letter on 
the instructions of the Chair was given to Mr Jonas recently for him to 
comment on what you stated and his comment appears, Chair, at page 
75 but what is relevant for the purposes of this session Chair, because 
in that response he deals largely with what happened between him and 
20 
General Nonope and General Ntlemeza but where he deals with 
General Matakata Chair would find at page 79 paragraph 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NORMAN:   And he – if I may read the paragraph he says, 
“Turning to the affidavit of Lieutenant General Matakata 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 120 of 123 
 
she claims that she was in General Ntlemeza’s office 
when he called me on two occasions.  I was never told 
that she was a participant in any of these calls” 
 
That seems – you have read that affidavit, it was given to you 
as well for you to read and you responded yesterday to that paragraph I 
would imagine, and your response appears at pages 84 and 85 and 
then what do you say in that short paragraph – that short affidavit in 
your response? 
LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL 
MATAKATA: 
 
May 
I 
read 
the 
whole 
…(intervenes). 
10 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes you’ll just start from paragraph three. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  Okay thanks, 
“The purpose of this affidavit is in compliance with a 
request from the Commission’s Investigating Team to 
reply to Mr Mcebisi Jonas’ response to my supporting 
affidavit dated 22 n d August 2018 to corroborate the 
affidavit of General Nonope who was served with a 
notice in terms of Rule 3.3 of the  Commissions rules.”  
In paragraph four: 
“My supporting affidavit is set out as set out above, 
20 
was limited in particular to corroborate General 
Nonope’s assertion to deny the idea of dissuading Mr 
Mcebisi Jonas from making a formal statement to the 
Hawks regarding an offer of Cabinet Minister as 
Minister of Finance by the Gupta family.  Reference is 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 121 of 123 
 
made herewith in paragraph three read with paragraph 
four of General Nonope’s affidavit attached herewith as 
Annexure AA1.’ 
From the response I paragraph 5. 
“From the response of Mr Mcebisi Jonas’ affidavit there 
is no indication to the effect that he is in dispute with 
my supporting affidavit except for refuting that he took 
an undertaking to come to our offices to provide 
statement 
as 
outlined 
in 
paragraph 
five 
of 
my 
supporting affidavit annexed herewith AA2.” 
10 
Paragraph 5.1: 
“In regard to his denial set above I stand by paragraph 
five of my supplementary affidavit.” 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, can I just find out from you, General when the 
meeting actually took place because Mr Jonas has testified about a 
meeting taking place between him and his lawyers and General 
Nonope, were you present? 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  No I was not present Chair. 
ADV NORMAN:  So in other words you would not know what transpired 
at that meeting? 
20 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:   No I wouldn’t know. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes, thank you.  Chair that is all from this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so basically it’s about the two telephone calls. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes that’s all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja and that’s all ja.  Okay no that’s fine, if you have 
19 NOVEMBER 2019 – DAY 190 
 
Page 122 of 123 
 
no further questions, I’m happy to excuse the Lieutenant General. 
ADV NORMAN:   Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Lieutenant General for coming 
to give evidence if we need you again, we’ll ask you to come again, but 
thank you very much and you are excused. 
LIEUTENANT GENERAL MATAKATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV NORMAN:  Chair those were the witnesses for today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to adjourn for the day, we will not 
have a hearing tomorrow but we will have a hearing on Thursday when 
10 
we’ll hear the evidence of Minister Nkoane Mashabane who was 
Minister of International Relations at the time of, I think, Waterkloof 
landing – the Waterkloof Landing who will give evidence about the 
promotion of Mr Koloane to the position of Ambassador. 
ADV NORMAN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That will be on Thursday, for today we stop here and 
we adjourn.
