PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 19 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
September, 
good 
morning 
everybody.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes we are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair if I may there is one point that 
I would like to place on record and that is that the investigators have 
had success in locating Major General Chris Ncobo. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that his Rule 3.3 Notice was in 
fact delivered to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Colonel Roelofse before we resume 
where we stopped yesterday there was one query that the – the Judge 
has requested you to obtain clarity on and that is in relation to the 
name which is reflected on page 42 of your affidavit in bundle KK2.1. 
And in particular paragraph 140.2.  The name which – is reflected there 
is Ranjeni Munusami which for the record is spelt R-a-n-j-e-n-i and the 
20 
surname is M-u-n-u-s-a-m-i.  We informed the Chair yesterday that we 
received a response to a 3.3 Notice that was purportedly sent to this 
individual however the response that we received was from an attorney 
more than one attorney actually representing a person whose name is 
spelt 
N-a-v-a-r-a-n-j-e-n-i 
surname 
M-u-n-u-s-a-m-y 
which 
is 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 3 of 233 
 
Navaranjeni Munusamy.  Have you been able to establish any clarity 
overnight on the evidence that you have given relative to paragraph 
140.2 in relation to the Ranjeni Munusami which is recorded in that 
paragraph and the other name which we have placed on record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I did.  I actually made a 
mistake in terms of the surname that I have recorded in my – in my 
affidavit.  It should read Y.  I again went back to the documentation that 
I have. The vehicle in question is registered in N Munusamy with a y at 
the end of the surname registered to an address which was used by the 
same person at the time which is also indicated on the – on the bank 
10 
statement from Wesbank.  So the two – the person that I am talking 
about is in fact Navarenjeni Munusamy.  I used the name Ranjeni that 
is because that is how she is known.  And secondly Chair what I also 
then – I also remembered that in 2014 I did in fact contact Ms Ranjeni 
Munusamy and – and I informed her of what I have found and asked her 
for a version and explanation.  I spoke about three times I think to her.  
She then said that she will speak to her legal representative.  I have 
never received any communication from her after that in respect of any 
explanation as to what had happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At this point in time all I can state 
is that the account held by Nissan – Nissan Atlantis or Atlantis Motors 
paid an amount into an account held by Navarenjeni Munusamy at 
Wesbank relating to the vehicle that she owned or that person owned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying that in terms of what is written in 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 4 of 233 
 
your affidavit there was just some spelling errors in terms of y? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it is the same person. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is the same person according to 
me yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you Chair.  In any event with 
the assistance of this witness we will obtain the – any identification 
details and communicate it or rather compare it to a request for identity 
details from the attorneys we have received correspondence from.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the – the name as written in your affidavit and 
the name as written in the letter of attorneys that Ms September read in 
terms of what you found when you were investigating which name 
appeared? Was it the one as written here except for the spelling error 
that you have mentioned or the one as indicated in the letter that Ms 
September has read out? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chairperson in respect of – in the 
documentation and I am talking about the registration docu – the 
[indistinct] documents relating to the vehicle as well as the bank 
account details.  It is N Munusamy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  N? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   N. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Navaranjeni Munusamy.  I knew 
her as Ranjeni because that is the name that I am – that I am familiar 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 5 of 233 
 
with so I presume what has happened is I used the name Ranjeni and 
did not put in the first part of Navarenjeni Munusamy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the documentation that you came across in your 
investigation reflected initial N for Nelly? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Munusamy? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then a certain address was given? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you made further investigations? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes which confirm it is the same 
address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you confirmed that it was the same person? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  I just wanted that clarification. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair – Chair if I may just to add to 
that.  The Rule 3.3 Notice that was in fact sent out was addressed to a 
Ms Ravaranjeni [Ranjeni]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to spell the … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I think that is best Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just so that we… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is addressed to a Ms and the first 
name is N-a-v-a-r-a-n-j-e-n-I in brackets is written Ranjeni which is 
spelt R-a-n-j-e-n-I and the surname if actually spelt M-u-n-u-s-a-m-i 
contrary to the spelling of this name in the affidavit itself.  When we 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 6 of 233 
 
received a response to the Rule 3.3 we have since received two 
responses through two different attorneys.  The first attorney has 
responded to inform that it is – it is Willem De Klerk attorney who … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Willem? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Willem De Klerk Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Willem De Klerk Attorneys ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who wrote a letter to us on the 13 t h 
– dated the 13 t h September 2019 informing that he represented Ms 
Ravaranjeni Munusami in addition to another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Following a response that we sent to 
them we did not receive any further communications from this attorney.  
On the 17 t h September which was the first date of evidence of this 
witness we then received a correspondence from Webber Wentzel 
Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Webber Wentzel? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who informed that they are 
representing Ms Ravaranjeni Ranjeni Munusamy. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Did they indicate if they were going to 
file an affidavit or anything?  Any of the two firms of attorneys or both? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair the first attorneys Willem De 
Klerk informed that they actually wanted a full copy of the entire 
affidavit. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 7 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And in response – and in addition to 
that they also informed that they represented the editor of the Sunday 
Times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The response to that not only called 
for an undertaking insofar as Rule Regulation 11.3 was not breached in 
any way in that they now appear to represent two clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Only one of whom is… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the – aha. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Referred… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the affidavit had not mentioned the editor had it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That was the first element of 
response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   First leg of the response.  And the 
second response was to inform that all the relevant paragraphs which 
20 
related to this particular transaction had in fact been provided and that 
included at least from paragraphs 133 up and until 140.2.  Also giving 
clarity to what the acronym of NWM means in 140.1.  We never 
received as I said a response to our letter from Willem De Klerk but the 
response that we did receive from Webber Wentzel is that the client 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 8 of 233 
 
requested an extension to submit her applications in response to the 
Rule 3.3 Notice and that if I may read at paragraph 3: 
“We request spending our client’s response to 
evidence pertaining to her. Any witness testimony not 
deal with evidence relating to our client.  It would be 
prejudicial to our client if such evidence is made 
public 
without 
our 
client 
having 
provided 
the 
commission with her events – her version of events 
and all their rights are reserved.  We did not however 
receive any substantive application of any sort.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if we could then just give clarity 
to this particular part of your evidence which you started yesterday but 
appeared not to have completed.  On page 42 at paragraph 140.2 you 
inform that it was on the 9 t h May 2008 that the amount of R143 621.78 
was paid to a Wesbank vehicle finance account to settle a vehicle 
registered in the name of Ranjeni Munusamy.  However what you also 
inform is that this amount reflected as received on the same date in 
that particular account but the amount was debited against the Atlantis 
Motors Barut account on the 30 t h July 2008.  That is near – that is a 
20 
lapse of time in nearly three months.  What did your investigations 
reveal insofar as this difference in time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in respect of that I spoke to 
the dealer principle at Nissan – Atlantis Motors.  The explanation was 
the payment was made on behalf of Colonel Barnard on his instruction 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 9 of 233 
 
and the payment was made from the funds of Atlantis Motors.  Now 
there had to be a – there was no funds coming from somewhere else to 
repay the R143 000.00 so Mr Venter was given an instruction to – to – 
what is the word I am looking for?  To place that money over from – to 
do a journal entry from the Barut account to the Nissan Atlantis – 
Atlantis Motors account to cancel the payment that was made on the 9 t h 
May.  In other words it was just – it was a book entry cancelling the 
payment to balance the books of Atlantis Motors.  So the – the money 
came from the Barut account whose – and that settled the amount 
which came from the Nissan Atlantis Motors – Atlantis Motors account. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us just get that clear.  You – when you were 
conducting your investigation it transpired that a certain amount just 
under R150 000.00 if I recall correctly. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had been paid to a bank in settlement of an account 
relating to the particular individual that you have talked about? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  The 
account related to a vehicle that was registered in this individual’s 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was Wes – was it Wesbank? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now at that time were you able to establish 
whose money that was that was used.  Did you see at that time that it 
was Atlantis Motors money or could you tell already that it was money 
coming from somewhere and simply going through Atlantis Motors or 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 10 of 233 
 
did you discover that later? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this transaction took place 
long before I – I got involved into the – with the investigation.  So at 
the time when I interviewed Mr Venter he – he showed me the – the 
transaction.  He explained to me what happened.  He then indicated to 
me that the amount came from Atlantis Motors on the 9 t h May and to 
cover the cost of that amount an amount – the same amount was then – 
there was a journal entry to cover the cost from the Atlantis Motors 
account so that the balance sheet at the end of the day could balance 
with respect to that transaction that took place.  So the money came 
10 
from the Barut account within the Atlantis Motors and it was if for a lack 
of better word it was then transferred to the Atlantis Motors account to 
balance the two transactions out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so the effect of the entire transaction was 
that – was the effect of the entire transaction that the payment was 
made by Atlantis Motors on behalf of or on the instructions of 
effectively Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Regardless of the dates the 
20 
money that was utilised for this came from the Barut account ultimately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was the Crime Intelligence account? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Which was an account within the 
books of Atlantis Motors yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 11 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Colonel Roelofse did your 
investigation establish any reasons for why Ms Munusamy received the 
monies in settlement of the vehicle? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair no.  As I stated earlier I did 
ask her.  I phoned her on more than one occasion I think it is at least 
three occasions requesting an explanation. She said she will revert to 
her legal representative.  Whether she did or not I do not know I have 
not – I have not received any correspondence or explanation from her 
after – after that and after my – and after me following up on my 
request. So I do not know – apart from the fact that I can state that the 
10 
money came from the Barut account into her account I do not know – I 
do not have any information relating to the context of that payment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who holds the documents which 
underpin this transaction? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It – the set of documents are held 
by Atlantis Motors as well as Wesbank. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Thank you.  If we can then resume 
where we left off yesterday and that is on page 47 of your affidavit.  
Chair I am informed that there is some technical problem and they need 
ten minutes to resolve. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see whether they are able to sort it out without 
an adjournment.  Do we need an adjournment?  Yes okay.  We will take 
an adjournment and resume when they are ready for us.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 12 of 233 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  If you can then 
resume on - with the evidence where you stopped off yesterday and this 
was the start of the evidence that you give in relation to the 
interference and difficulties and challenges that you faced through the 
investigations you led and were involved in.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the investigation that you started 
with begins at page 45 and it deals with the investigation into the 
10 
abuse of the - the SSA which resulted in fraud and corruption charges 
being levelled against General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard.  Is that 
right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Bearing in mind that the decision that 
was taken to withdraw the charges against these individuals have been 
tested through our courts.  It is to be understood then that - we ask 
rather that the evidence that you give in relation to this investigation 
talks specifically to what you did and the steps you took in relation to 
this investigation. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yesterday you did mention that it was 
on 5 December 2012 and not 4 December 2012 as reflected in the 
consultation note when Advocate Mrwebi decided to withdraw these 
charges immediately against General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 13 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  I mention - I 
am mentioning the 5 t h as that was his testimony regarding that.  I do 
not have - I only have the document which states the 4 t h but I was privy 
to his testimony which says he - he corrected it and said he only draw - 
he drew up the - the note on the 5 t h. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And through you Chair the - the 
courts have certainly tested the factual evidence in relation to the 
difference in dates and they were more inclined to accept that it was in 
fact the 5 t h as opposed to the 4 t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What you can do with regard to matters where 
10 
there is a - a judgment that has not been challenged is you can just tell 
me the important factual findings.  If there are any legal findings that 
are relevant.  You can just mention them that this is what was found 
and then the witness can give evidence only really to put context if it is 
necessary or to fill in gaps that might not have been dealt with in the 
judgment because they might not have been relevant. 
So that we do not need to go through the whole thing but for 
purposes of making sure that those who are listening understand what 
is going on you can in advance just identify the findings of the court 
that will be - that he will mention to say these are the findings that 
20 
were made. 
That there - there is no pending appeal and then the witness 
can fill in terms of context and issues that were not dealt with. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  In - I have 
prepared but it is really just a note from me which highlights certain 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 14 of 233 
 
paragraph - key paragraph references on the findings in both the High 
Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal in relation to the - these 
judgments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is - that is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  With your leave can I hand it up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It has not been paginated or any of 
10 
the sort but it is just a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Reference note.  If I can then ask 
you to turn to - in fact yesterday when we ended you spoke about the 
memorandum that you become privy to when that was referred to as the 
Breytenbach/Ferreira memorandum dated 13 April 2012.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What steps did you then take after 
receiving this memorandum? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
after 
receiving 
that 
20 
memorandum … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am just sorry.  Let us connect properly with 
where we left off yesterday.  Which memorandum?  What page is it 
again? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The memorandum is KDR12 which is 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 15 of 233 
 
at - starts at page 1-6-5 and it is referenced in paragraph 1-5-8 on 
page 47 on the - in the affidavit itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the affidavit what page/paragraph? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry.  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph in the - in the - I am sorry.  What 
paragraph in the affidavit? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is at page 47 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  1-5-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he was still answering what did you do after 
getting this memorandum at page 1-6-5. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair when - when I received the 
memorandum and it also coupled with the - with the letter received from 
Advocate Mrwebi which dated 30 March 2012.  I - I requested 
General Dramat from my office to write again to Advocate Jiba because 
the response that we received was not from Advocate Jiba as requested 
and therefore he then he - he did - he did write that request … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and I am sorry.  The letter from or memorandum 
from Mr Mrwebi also did not say that he was writing at the request of or 
on behalf of Ms Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He just wrote, ja. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 16 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Did not say any … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was not addressed to the - to - 
to Advocate Jiba either. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that particular - that particular 
letter of response of Advocate Mrwebi as the Chair has alluded 
certainly did not indicate any form of response from Advocate Jiba.  Is 
that right? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Then 
what 
happened 
during 
May 2012? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether May 2012 takes him to where 
he was before one of us interrupted him.  You had asked him to - I think 
he was talking about asking General Dramat to write to Ms Jiba again 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do you want to just complete that answer? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that was on 23 April 2012.  
That is after receiving the - the response from - from Advocate Mrwebi.  
20 
I requested General Dramat to write to Advocate Jiba so that we can 
get a response from her because the - the request was to reconsider 
the - the decision that was taken by Advocate Mrwebi as he was not in 
a position to review his own decision. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And did Advocate Jiba respond? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 17 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair she did not respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  Where is the letter that 
General Dramat wrote to Ms Jiba?  Let us identify that letter first. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what it said in …. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is annexure … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The thrust of the letter even if you do not read the 
letter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  Can we go to 
page 1-8-9?  Is this the letter that you refer to? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this letter is dated 23 April 2012 
written by signature of Lieutenant-General Dramat addressed to 
Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if we look at - in the second 
paragraph can you please read that into the record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it states the following: 
“There after I received a response again from 
Advocate Mrwebi that the matter is finalised and 
20 
that he abide by - by his decision.  In the - in the 
circumstances I will appreciate a decision on the 
matter by you as the ultimate authority in respect of 
the consideration of the - of a prosecution.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You can continue. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 18 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Did 
Ms Jiba 
respond 
to 
this 
letter 
from 
General Dramat? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  She did - she did not 
respond.  Her Office Manager responded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her Office Manager? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is that response? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could take you to page - it is 
Annexure 17 at page 200. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the effect of the response Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I may read.  It is 
addressed to General Dramat. 
“Dear Lieutenant-General Dramat, the above matter 
refers to your correspondence dated 23 April 2012.  
Please be advised the matter was attended by 
Advocate Mrwebi in his capacity as the Head of 
Specialised Commercial Crime Unit as the subject 
matter falls within his area of jurisdiction.  I trust 
that the above is in order.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was from J Lepinka? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair who is 
according to this letter the Manager Executive Support to the National 
Director of Public Prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So once again Ms Jiba did not respond herself? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 19 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this letter does not say that Ms Lepinka is writing 
at the request of Ms Jiba or on behalf of Ms Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She just responds to a letter that was not address to 
her? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did anyone respond to the initial 
request 
of 
23 April 2012 
which 
was 
written 
by 
the 
Office 
of 
10 
General Dramat to Advocate Jiba outside of Ms Lepinka? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  Nobody responded.  
The - the only responses came after the application of - after the 
application by FUL in the High Court in Gauteng North. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what response was that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That was a response - Chair I 
have to just go - go there.  It will be later in that same year. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you perhaps refer to a meeting 
that was had between General Dramat and Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so to that end can - and this was 
also following additional correspondence that was sent in the interim 
calling on Advocate Jiba to respond.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not following that now.  Let us do it according to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 20 of 233 
 
sequence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When - when General Dramat received or rather did 
General Dramat become aware of the letter from J Lepinka? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  I received a 
copy of that letter from General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did he address any further correspondence to 
Ms Jiba or to anyone at the NPA? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair he did after there was a 
couple of months that went - that went by.  In that timeframe other 
10 
things happened.  So it - it follows a bit later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Who was this addressed to this further 
correspondence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
It 
was 
again 
addressed 
to 
Advocate Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Where do we find that in the bundle? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes.  If I can take you to - to 
paragraph 1-6-3 on page 48.  You refer to a letter that was sent by 
General Dramat on 7 June 2012.  Is that the letter that you refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so to can I then …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on, hang on.  Did you say we should 
go to page 1-6-3? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At paragraph 1-6-3 of his affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where is that annexure? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 21 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 2-0-2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the letter from General Dramat to Ms Jiba 
again? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What was the thrust of that letter from 
General Dramat to Ms Jiba Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it reiterate the previous 
correspondence and again requested that to review the decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And it also - it also - it went a 
10 
little bit further in the sense that he explained to her what the mandate 
is of the DPCI together with the mandate of the IGI as to what the 
outcome of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Situation was and he - he again 
asked her for her assistance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To review the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then just finalise the 
20 
communications between the office and Advocate Jiba in particular 
before we talk to any responses by Advocate Mrwebi.  We are now on 
page 48 paragraph 1-6-4 of your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What happened on 2 August 2012 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 22 of 233 
 
which is at the bottom of page 48? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us start with did General Dramat 
receive a response from Ms Jiba this time in - after the letter of 
7 June 2012 from General Dramat? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I do not know whether there 
was a response - a written response.  I do know there was a - there 
was a meeting between the two and then General Dramat responded in 
respect of the meeting that took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  When - what - on what date did the meeting 
take place if you remember? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was on 1 August 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was on 1 August? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then on 2 August General Dramat wrote 
another letter to Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  Thanking 
her for the - for the meeting and - and stating that the matter was 
sufficiently resolved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How was the matter resolved? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I may refer to that letter 
20 
which is KDR19. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is at page 2-0-5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is a letter from General Dramat to 
Ms Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 23 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  It refers to his letter of 7 June 2012 and 
thanking Ms Jiba for a meeting that was held on 1 August 2012 and 
then in the second paragraph it says: 
“The meeting sufficiently resolved all the concerns 
raised in my letter.  I have taken note of 
shortcomings identified during our meeting and 
have instructed the investigating officer to obtain 
instructions/guidance from the prosecutor.  I would 
like to thank you for your response to the issues 
raised and the manner in which they have been 
10 
addressed.” 
So that was the response? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That was the response to the 
meeting.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously General Dramat would have given you - 
would have briefed you on the discussions between herself (sic) and 
Ms Jiba if you did not attend the meeting yourself? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I did not attend the meeting 
but he did brief me, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please talk to me more about how the issue was 
20 
resolved. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I had to put this into 
context and I need to go back to the - up until the end of April 2012 all 
the communication that we received from the NPA came from 
Advocate Mrwebi and in that communication he made it quite clear that 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 24 of 233 
 
- that he regarded the investigation as closed.  To me there is no other 
meaning than the investigation is stopped.  That is how he saw it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And then with the application that 
FUL brought before the High Court in - in Gauteng North … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the meeting - did the - did that application - was 
that application launched after the meeting between General Dramat 
and Ms Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No.  It was before that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I just want - oh, you want to give the context … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I want to understand what the basis was for 
the resolution but if you need to give the context it is fine. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as I said the full application 
was launched I think in May 20- 2012.  In the application it was stated 
that  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So when the meeting was held the - the full 
application had been launched? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Had already been launched Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had not been decided? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  Had not been decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was in that timeframe where 
answering affidavits had to be filed by the NPA.  Shortly after those 
papers were filed and the questions were asked as to why the matter 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 25 of 233 
 
has or what had happened, why was the matter withdrawn the position 
of Mr Mrwebi changed and he then stated I did not say that the matter 
is closed. 
I said there were shortcoming in the investigation that needs 
to be finalised.  So that is where … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is where he then changed 
after the application was - was launched … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And he also mentioned that in his 
10 
affidavit - his answering affidavit to the - in terms of the FUL 
application.  I was requested to supply an answering not an answering 
affidavit - confirmatory affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Relating to his affidavit and in that 
regard he sent me or the State Attorney sent me a draft affidavit from 
Advocate Mrwebi.  In the draft affidavit there were various inaccuracies 
which I did not agree with.  So I sent something back to them and said 
please provide me with the actual signed affidavit so that I can have a 
look at it and that was never provided to me but in terms of those 
20 
inaccuracies I - I sent an email to Advocate Mrwebi stating to him I do 
not agree and this is not true and - but nevertheless he continued with 
his affidavit. 
I did not file the confirmatory affidavit.  In fact I was - I was 
informed afterwards that my confirmatory affidavit was attached but it 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 26 of 233 
 
was not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  My confirmatory affidavit that they 
wanted - Advocate Mrwebi - was attached to Advocate Mrwebi’s 
response but it was not signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you sent an unsigned affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No.  I did not sign any affidavit.  I 
refused to sign an affidavit because I was not - I was not given a final 
affidavit from Advocate Mrwebi and in terms of what he sent in his draft 
affidavit I did not agree what he said. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the position that the State Attorney had 
prepared an affidavit that you were - that you were asked to look at 
with a view to signing but you looked at it and you did not agree with it 
and - but ultimately that unsigned affidavit was placed before the 
court? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
The 
answering 
affidavit 
of 
Advocate Mrwebi was placed before court and attached to that was my 
confirmatory affidavit which I refused to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An unsigned affidavit by you? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And unsigned affidavit my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  From my side and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  My … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 27 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the unsigned affidavit was not in accordance 
whit the facts as you knew them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair because that 
is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and it had not been prepared at your request? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair.  It had not been - I was 
just - I was just emailed the - the answering affidavit together with my 
confirmatory affidavit and the contents thereof and I said I do not 
agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would - would it have been the State Attorney 
10 
who emailed it to - the Office of the State Attorney? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you understand - did you ever get to know 
from them what - where they got the information from on the basis of 
which they prepared that affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair my confirmatory affidavit 
only stated that I confirm certain paragraphs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was said? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Certain paragraphs in the affidavit 
of - of Advocate Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So - so they may have expected 
that … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 28 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your version and Mr Mrwebi’s version would be the 
same? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair humble apologies for the 
interruption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But I understand that there is no 
audio whatsoever … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And I am not sure for how long 
either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  We will adjourn again.  Hopefully it is going 
to be sorted out once and for all.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair did you have any further 
questions following…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well do we know how much was covered and how 
much wasn’t covered, I think that we must go back just a little bit to 
make sure that everything that he said was covered. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think where we were is that I had I had asked you, 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 29 of 233 
 
Mr Roelofse to tell me what the basis was on which your concerns and 
those of Mr Dramat – General Dramat were resolved by the meeting 
that took place between General Dramat and Miss Jiba and you were 
telling the story and you said that Freedom Under Law had launched an 
application to the High Court in the meantime and I think it was an 
application to have the decision to withdraw charges against General 
Mdluli, withdrawn they wanted to have that decision set aside, is that 
correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you said that the office of the State Attorney 
10 
which I take it would have represented the NPA had forwarded, to you, 
Advocate Magwebe’s affidavit that was to be filed in Court in regard to  
his role on the withdrawal of the charges against General Mdluli and 
they had prepared a confirmatory affidavit which they wanted you to 
consider signing which, if you had signed it would have confirmed that 
the version our Advocate Magwebe in relation to the withdrawal of the 
charges was factually correct and you looked at the affidavit of Mr 
Magwebe and you concluded that you were not  in a position to confirm 
that version because it was inaccurate in certain respects and you 
informed the office of the State Attorney accordingly, is that correct? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, I not only 
informed them I also informed Advocate Magwebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you inform them by way of an email, a 
memorandum or how did you inform them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   An email Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 30 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes same was email was sent to the office of the 
State Attorney as well as Mr Magwebe? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did that email point out in what respects you 
thought Mr Magwebe’s version was not correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes do we have that email here? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Unfortunately Chair I don’t have it 
here it was presented to the Mokgoro Commission and I – because we 
only dealt with this issue regarding this National Prosecuting Authority 
10 
not in detail, I didn’t attach it to this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but it is – you can find it if necessary? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I would like to see it, if you can make 
arrangements to make it available to the legal team. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but you say that – you said that neither the 
State Attorney’s office nor Advocate Magwebe reverted to you after 
receiving your email? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair Advocate Magwebe did 
20 
revert back to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja what did he say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He was telling me I must not put 
inaccurate information in the public domain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 31 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He said in his email that I – he 
doesn’t know what I’m talking about and I should be careful not to put 
inaccurate information in the public domain.  Now what exactly he 
meant by that I don’t know, he did not deal with the issues that I had, 
he just made a broad statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and the office of the State Attorney did not come 
– revert to you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair nobody reverted back to 
me after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but from what you are saying it would seem 
10 
therefore that the office of the State Attorney was aware or became 
aware through your email that the – you were not in agreement with the 
version put up by Mr Magwebe? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair, they must 
have been because it was addressed to the attorney dealing with the 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but they never prepared an affidavit that would 
reflect what you said that you were going to sign? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair they never – they never 
did that, I never received an affidavit in terms of what I had to say. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you, and then of course when you 
get that email that you sent to the office of the State Attorney and 
Advocate Magwebe, if you can also get his response to your email if 
that’s – if it’s possible to get it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I will do so Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 32 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Just to cover some of the ground 
that you have not addressed as yet, if you can go back to 
page…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Miss September I don’t think that we have 
got to the answer to my question and that’s probably because I’ve been 
asking you a lot of questions, namely what was the basis on which the 
issues or your concerns and those of General Dramat resolved at the 
between General Dramat and Miss Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I – this is now what I 
10 
deduced as to what happened because at the time with the full 
application I think there was a realisation that Advocate Magwebe had a 
problem in terms of his response – his previous responses about the 
case not being – that the investigation needs to be stopped.  So in the 
affidavits that were prepared for the full application by the NPA it 
stated that the investigations were never stopped but certain 
deficiencies had to be addressed and once that is done the case will be 
placed back on the roll – the Court roll.  That is, in short what 
answering affidavits of Mr Magwebe stated which is in contrast to what 
he has written to General Dramat.  So there was a – I think after they 
20 
saw the affidavit, the founding affidavit they decided to – or he decided 
to change his version and the version then went, I did not withdraw, the 
matter wasn’t stopped, the matter is still continuing there is certain 
investigation outstanding and that’s why it’s not being placed back on 
the Court roll.  Based on that there was then a meeting with Advocate 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 33 of 233 
 
Jiba which then was resolved on the premise that there is now – there 
is still investigation to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me try and understand that because you see 
the letter from General Dramat of the 2 n d of August 2012 which was 
sent to Miss Jiba following the meeting that the two of them had on the 
1 s t of August seems to reflect satisfaction on the part of General 
Dramat that the issues that he had been raising, to which Miss Jiba was 
not responding – had not been responding until then were satisfactorily 
resolved.  Now as far as I recall, what the concern was from you and 
General Dramat – the concern was, this decision by Advocate 
10 
Magwebe, to withdraw the charges is unacceptable.  You as the final 
authority at the NPA, we are asking you to review this decision that is 
what the concern was, am I right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is, did Miss Jiba, at that meeting 
confirm that Advocate Magwebe had withdrawn the decision – the 
charges but she had now decided to review it and the matter will be 
placed on the roll once certain issues had been sorted out by way of 
investigation or did she say, look, it seems there has been a 
misunderstanding here, there’s been no withdrawal of charges the 
20 
investigation must cover certain issues. Once they are covered the 
matter will be placed on the roll again, what exactly did she say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as I stated I wasn’t at the 
meeting, from what I understood General Dramat to say as to what had 
happened is that there was never an intention to stop the investigation 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 34 of 233 
 
as per our request to review this decision of Mr Magwebe.  So the 
position has changed to the view there was never a decision to stop so 
that is on that premise that she spoke to General Dramat as if there 
were no decision that the investigation had to stop.  That is why I am 
saying that when Advocate Magwebe changed his version of events 
after the full application where suddenly the investigation wasn’t 
stopped it was now – there was certain investigations outstanding and 
based on that we said, fine we will continue and I think that’s where the 
satisfaction came from General Dramat that we now can continue and 
there will be a Prosecutor that will deal with the matter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I will want us to go back to the correspondence 
from Mr Magwebe just to check how, what he wrote there matches up 
with you understood was the position that was taken by him in regard to 
the full application as well as what Miss Jiba may have said to General 
Dramat but at the time that Advocate Magwebe made the decision to 
withdraw the charges, had General Mdluli pleaded to the charges in 
Court or not as far as you recall? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair they have not…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They have not pleaded yet? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair they haven’t. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if the Prosecutor withdraws charges before 
the accused has pleaded, you as the police can’t be prevented by 
anybody can you, from doing further investigation and if the Prosecutor 
thought that all the information available at the time there was not a 
proper case, you can’t be prevented from pursuing the investigation 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 35 of 233 
 
and then later on submitting the same matter to the NPA for a new 
decision? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I agree with you because 
that is the situation.  In this regard because of the letters that Advocate 
Magwebe wrote and it – and I’m referring specifically to two letters, in 
which one he states that the IGI had the mandate to investigate and we 
cannot investigate, it falls within our mandate and  he went as far as 
saying the investigation is illegal and in the second letter which he then 
– on answering the IGI letter, he then said that the mandate falls within 
the scope of the Attorney General or the Accounting General to 
10 
investigate the matter and that we were also outside our mandate in 
that it’s with them as well as the Parliamentary Committee or the 
Intelligence Committee at Parliament, it is within their mandate.  So his 
reason for stopping the investigation then changed from the IGI to the 
AG and then based on that there’s no other conclusion from my side 
other than he stopped the investigation but you’re quite right I did not 
stop the investigation, I continued with the investigation because in the 
light of what Mr – Colonel Naidoo has told us but we didn’t have any 
recourse as to go back to Court if the NPA is not going to look at the 
docket itself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let’s go to those letters again from Advocate 
Magwebe, I just want to have a look at them. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem Chair Mr Roelofse you 
mentioned that there was a letter as such which sought to rely on the 
IGI and that was a letter by Advocate Magwebe, is that right because 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 36 of 233 
 
we understand it to be the representations that were in fact made in 
support of the withdrawal of the charges against General Mdluli and 
Colonel Barnard. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair that is what I’m actually 
referring to, it’s the memo of which the date is not know whether it’s 
the 4 t h or the 5 t h. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Indeed so can I ask you to turn to 
page 140 please.  
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that the memorandum that you 
10 
were referring to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it’s in this particular 
memorandum that reference is made that the IGI is the authority that 
ought to be considering it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And if I can ask you to turn to page 
146…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on please, so in that memorandum 
Advocate Magwebe among other things says, that is the memorandum 
20 
dated 4 December 2011 addressed to Advocate S Mziyati and a copy 
being sent to Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach, one it says that he had 
consulted with Advocate Mziyati with the purpose of conveying his 
views on the matter and then he says that the matter fell squarely 
within the mandate of the Inspector General in terms of the Intelligence 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 37 of 233 
 
Services Oversight Act and number 40 of 1994 and then he says, 
 
“I noted that it is only the Inspector General who, by law is 
 
authorised to have full access to the Crime Intelligence 
 
documents and information and thus who could give a 
 
complete view of the matter as the investigations can never be 
 
complete without access to such documents and information.  
 
In my view the process followed in this matter is possibly 
 
illegal as being in contravention to the said provisions of the 
 
Intelligence Services Oversight Act”, 
 
And then he refers to representations received from the 
10 
attorneys representing Mr Mdluli and he says that, 
 
“The representations seek a withdrawal of the criminal case 
 
against General Mdluli on the grounds that the Institution of 
 
the investigation prosecution against him is an abuse of the 
 
Criminal Justice System and then he says, the purpose of this 
 
document, therefore, is to deal with and record a decision on 
 
the matter.  It is the further aim that the documents shall serve 
 
as a consultative document with the Director of Public 
 
Prosecutions [indistinct] required by Section 24 (3) of the NPA 
 
Act”. 
20 
 
We did look at this memo yesterday but I just want to check 
certain things in the context of what we are dealing with now. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The assertions made, if I may with 
regard to the IGI is if Chair turns to page 146 in context it reads from 
paragraph 17 and continues…[intervenes]. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 38 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry page 146? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    146 Chair paragraph 17 sets it into 
context where he says that, 
 
“Whether there was evidence in the matter or not is my view 
 
not important for my decision in the matter and then he goes 
 
on to speak about” …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I’m sorry paragraph 17, it’s paragraph 16 
he says, 
 
“The evidence in the docket as well as the report of the 
 
prosecutor do not seem to help in the matter either, this state 
10 
 
of affairs leaves one with a number of questions about how 
 
both the investigator and the prosecution handled the matter.  
 
As matters stand there was clearly no reasonable and probable 
 
ground for any prosecution in the matter particularly against 
 
Mdluli”. 
 
So there he is saying the prosecution was pursued without any 
reasonable and probable grounds, so in fact he’s saying the 
prosecution shouldn’t have – should not have been initiated, then in 17 
he says, 
 
“However because of the view I hold of the matter I do not 
20 
 
propose to traverse the merits of the case and the other 
 
questions any further whether there was evidence in the matter 
 
or not is, in my view not important for my decision in the 
 
matter.  The proposition which I allude to below should, alone 
 
and without any further ado be dispositive of the matter”. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 39 of 233 
 
 
So that seems to suggest that he is saying, irrespective of 
what evidence there may be on the merits the point I’m going to come 
up with means this should be the end, that’s how I understand that 
paragraph. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair and he goes further, in 
paragraph 
18 
and 
19 
he 
talks 
specifically 
to 
the 
Inspector 
General…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes…[intervenes]. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It concludes in paragraph 20 on 
page 147. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on paragraph 18,  
 
“Mdluli and Barnard are members of the Crime Intelligence 
 
Division of the South African Police Service which is part of 
 
the Intelligence Structures of the country and as such their 
 
conduct and activities are subject to the laws, regulations, 
 
policies and procedures governing the Intelligence community.  
 
of importance for the present purposes the Intelligence 
 
Oversight Act 40 of 1994, the Act in Section 7 thereof establish 
 
the office of the Inspector General and defines it’s functions 
 
and then 19, in terms of Section 77 C(A) of the Act the 
20 
 
Inspector General in relation to services has a function to 
 
receive and investigate complaints from members of the public 
 
and members of the services on alleged maladministration, 
 
abuse of power, transgressions of the constitutional laws and 
 
policies referred in paragraph A, the commission of an offence 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 40 of 233 
 
 
referred to in part 1 to 4 then refers to Sections.  It will be 
 
noted that the offences for which Mdluli is charged falls 
 
squarely within the mandate of the Inspector General as 
 
quoted above”, 
 
Yes, you want to continue? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so Chair that is one of the 
reasons that he relies on in order to make the decision that he does 
and if I can direct your attention to another sentence which talks to 
your query Chair, on page 148 paragraph 22, six lines into that 
paragraph the sentence begins, 
10 
 
“With any investigation of the kind in the present case would 
 
be futile without the involvement of the Inspector General as 
 
the transactions which Mdluli is charged with can only be 
 
explained in terms of the internal applicable procedures, 
 
policies, 
processes 
and 
systems 
which 
the 
ordinary 
 
investigator has no access to”. 
 
And his final conclusions is recorded in paragraph 26,27 and 
28 of this letter on page 149. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “I’m afraid that on the face of it, it appears that the 
 
manner the investigators went about dealing with this matter 
20 
 
assists [indistinct] by the members of the National Prosecuting 
 
Authority may possibly be in breach of the Security Regulation, 
 
however, as it appears that everybody concerned in this matter 
 
must have committed a bone fide error of law in this regard, it 
 
is not too late to remedy the situation but by referring the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 41 of 233 
 
 
matter to the Inspector General in terms of Section 7 
 
accordingly and based on the above prosecution of the matter 
 
cannot continue.  The investigator must advise these certain 
 
members of the Crime Intelligence to refer their complaint to 
 
the Inspector General for consideration and any subsequent 
 
steps will be guided by what the Inspector General advises.  
 
The Prosecutor is accordingly instructed to withdraw the 
 
charges against both General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard 
 
immediately”, 
 
So there’s no doubt that he gave an instruction that the 
10 
charges be withdrawn. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s no doubt that the reason he advanced was 
that, to say the least 1) on what was in the docket there was no 
reasonable and probable cause to initiate the prosecution against the 
two but 2) he was saying, no investigation relating to this matter would 
be complete without involving the office of the Inspector General, is 
that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what doesn’t seem to come across clearly, at 
20 
least as I read this and you might be able to assist is whether what he 
means is, the – Inspector General must play her role depending on 
what emerges after she has played role the matter might still be 
pursued.  It doesn’t come out whether he was saying anything about 
that, so in other words it doesn’t seem to be clear whether  he was 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 42 of 233 
 
saying, withdraw the charges for now, if later on we receive something 
from the Inspector General that changes the picture then we may 
reinstate the charges, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think your – I think it is 
correct, unfortunately I had the – I also had sight of the other 
documents so maybe my mind is a little bit poisoned in terms of what 
I’m reading here…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what you are free to say is, yes that’s the 
picture that emerges from this document but when one has regard to 
other correspondence or other documents the picture changes and then 
10 
you can tell me about those others. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I will do so Chair what came out 
of this document for me is the fact that he wanted the investigation out 
of the South African Police and within the mandate IGI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The letter that appears on page 157 
of the bundle which is a letter from the IGI to Lieutenant General 
Nkwanazi, is however, dispositive of the mandate of the IGI and in 
particular affirms that the mandate of criminal investigations rests 
solely with the police. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it was also the recommendation 
of the IGI office that the matter be referred back to the NPA for the 
institution of the criminal charges. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 43 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So on the 19 t h of March 2012 there 
could not have been any doubt as to what the mandate was of the IGI 
relative to this matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   That was the first issue that was 
raised insofar as the office of the IGI is concerned. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The other issue that you mentioned 
earlier was that which related to the Attorney General’s office. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can ask you to go to page 
47…[intervenes]. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Page 160 follows after the letter 
from the IGI where it was now reverted back to the NPA for prosecution 
as per the letter from the IGI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And then I want to refer to the 
next Annexure, page 162. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes, paragraph 2, 3 and 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it’s a letter from Advocate Magwebe again to 
General Dramat. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 44 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 2 you say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   2, 3 and 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to read them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    
“I wish to advise that the office of the Inspector General of 
Intelligence has no oversight function and power of review with 
regard to prosecutorial decisions.  I also wish to remind that 
the NPA is an independent institution and prosecutorial 
decisions are its sole prerogative.  The view of the IG 
following your solicitation of her opinion on the NPA decision 
10 
on the matter based on the document which the police or 
anybody else were not even legally entitled to possess is for 
your consumption and does not affect the decision taken on 
the matter.  The NPA took a principled and considerate 
decision on this matter without fear or favour as is required to 
do in terms of the law, that decision stands and the matter is 
closed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so there is that, the matter is closed that you 
talked about earlier? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and it also 
20 
deals with the consultative note that he has now – that he has given on 
the 4 t h of December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so your point is when you – when one 
reads the memorandum to which I referred earlier on one may be 
getting the impression that it does not necessarily say what would 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 45 of 233 
 
happen after the IGI office had done played its role? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – what you are saying is when you read the 
other correspondence including this correspondence and take all the 
correspondence 
and 
the 
notes 
or 
memorandums 
together 
the 
conclusion can only be that Advocate Mrwebi saw this as the end of the 
matter as his decision as the end of the matter.  Am I right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Even – even with the referral of 
10 
the IG saying that the mandate falls within the SAPS and the NPA must 
prosecute the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because first he says the matter falls within the 
mandate of the IG office. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it must be referred there.  They write back and 
say no, no, no, it is within SAPS and then when they say that which 
should then open the way for the matter to be pursued further he writes 
back and says: 
“IG you have no oversight powers over our decision.  
20 
My decision stands and the matter is closed.” 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is quite clear you say from this letter that he 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 46 of 233 
 
does not contemplate the matter being pursued further? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair you will see 
they will follow their – after this there is two other letters that follows 
on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Which just reiterates what I have 
just said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That same attitude.  Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then following the memorandum 
which was authored by Advocates Breytenbach and Advocate Ferreira 
10 
there was the request made at your instance through the office of 
Dramat to Advocate Jiba to which Advocate Mrwebi responded. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  That is the 
letter that I just read into the record. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And at page – paragraph 160 on 
page 47 you talk specifically to a letter dated 26 April 2012, is that 
correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and as far 
as I know that is the letter from the IGI which was attached to this 
letter when it was forwarded to the – to Advocate Jiba. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 196 
please?  Is this the letter that you refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair no the response to the 
letter that I referred to was the one – it was the one on page 160. In 
other words the response – the letter in terms of – from Advocate – I 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 47 of 233 
 
mean from General Dramat to Advocate Jiba follows on the letter of the 
IGI. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes which you have addressed 
already. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Which I have just addressed now. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So that is that letter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Then the answer to that letter 
follows on page 162.   
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay let us just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the one at 162 is one that we have just looked at. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes.  We have.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Then if I may page 189. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Dramat now again refers 
the decision back or asks the – the – Advocate Jiba to review Advocate 
Mrwebi’s decision based on the letter that I just dealt with. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct which you have also 
20 
addressed already. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct.  And then based 
on this – on this letter that I have just looked at now we go to the page 
that you have mentioned earlier. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct which is page 196.   
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 48 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  This is now 
the response on the second letter of General Dramat. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Are we on the same page now? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   196 yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay.  And this is then the letter 
that was authored by Advocate Mrwebi addressed to Advocate 
Breytenbach, Advocate Ferreira, Advocate Mzinyathi. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Dated 26 April 2012,is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page – or 
rather what is the essence of this letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the essence of this letter is 
that it is now the AG that is supposed to look at – that has the mandate 
to investigate these matters and if I may read into the record paragraph 
– the second paragraph on page 198? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct.  Can you read the second 
paragraph and also the first two sentences of the next paragraph? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    
“It is a known fact that the Auditor General examined 
20 
the information containing the alleged criminal 
transactions by Mdluli and Barnard and based on 
rules governing the Secret Services Account found 
nothing 
untoward 
with 
the 
transaction. 
 
The 
necessary report in this regard was given to the joint 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 49 of 233 
 
standing committee on intelligence and as such to 
Parliament.  Are the police and the prosecutors now 
questioning the integrity of these institutions?  I do 
not think we have the authority and in any event we 
want to go – even if we want to go that route we 
have to do it in a legal and proper manner.  It is my 
considered view that it will therefore not be in the 
interest of justice for the [indistinct] to be further 
involved in this matter.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so once the issues relating to 
10 
the mandate of the IGI were dispositive through the letter of the 19 t h 
March 2012 through this letter another issue was raised and that was in 
relation to the Attorney General’s office, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  And I – 
actually I made a mistake.  This was an internal memorandum within 
the NPA. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Between Advocate Breytenbach, 
Ferreira, Mzinyathi and Advocate Mrwebi. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Correct.  Did you take any steps in 
20 
order to get clarity from the office of the Attorney General of South 
Africa in relation to these assertions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are going to confuse him now.  You talking about 
the Attorney General.  We do not have an Attorney General. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The Auditor General. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 50 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not have an Attorney General in South Africa 
anymore. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Sorry. My mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The Auditor General.  Humble 
apologies.  At paragraph 160.1 on page 47 you talk to specifics. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   160.1. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Steps that you took or rather my 
question to you is did you take any steps to get clarity on the AGSA 
point? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Can you just repeat the page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We are on page 47 of your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Oh 47 of the affidavit. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Paragraph 160.1. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I did.  I had a meeting 
with Ms Alice Miller from the IGI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that reference to AGSA must be wrong because 
that would be Auditor General of South Africa is it not?  He must have 
meant IGI or not? 
 ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is the Auditor General of South 
Africa Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he mean the Auditor General he did not… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 51 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Get confused? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No, no I did not get confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where would the Auditor General get in in terms 
of criminal investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the Auditor General does 
audits and they would point out inefficiencies, maladministration or 
irregularities and then they would refer it to the Department for the 
decision as to what to do with it and to take further action.  Whether it 
10 
is for criminal action or disciplinary action that is what the – that is the 
function of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not that I understand but was it not – is the 
position not that you were all dealing with at this stage was the 
decision by Advocate Mrwebi to withdraw the charges… 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and his – what appears like a refusal to change 
that decision which was criminal prosecution.  Now at one stage he 
said the investigation should be done by the Inspector General’s office.  
Now that part I understand but I am – I do not understand the reference 
20 
to the office of the Auditor General except if it is for purposes of simply 
obtaining certain reports or getting somebody from the Auditor 
General’s office who would depose to a certain affidavit about matters 
that are covered by the AG’s office.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair maybe I must get – give a 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 52 of 233 
 
little bit of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Of background in terms of this.  
What had happened is the following.  The avenue that Advocate Mrwebi 
tried to take in terms of the IGI was blocked so he did not have that 
avenue anymore.  And then what happened is according to him and I 
am referring to his own testimony now.  He had meetings from high 
level police individuals who came to speak to him and explain to him 
exactly how the Crime Intelligence works and why the mandate of this 
investigation does not fall within SAPS.  And based on that he now 
10 
writes an internal memorandum and – to Advocate Breytenbach, 
Mzinyathi to explain to them that this matter that we are investigating 
the Mdluli/Barnard matter has already been investigated and he goes 
further he says and I am quoting from paragraph 160.  He says:   
“It is a known fact that the Auditor General examined 
the information contained – containing the alleged 
criminal transaction by General Mdluli and Colonel 
Barnard.”   
This is now the vehicle transaction and the vehicle that was – what is 
the word I am looking for?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was traded in. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The traded in vehicle that is 
correct Chair.   
“The criminal transaction by General Mdluli and 
Colonel Barnard and based on the rules governing 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 53 of 233 
 
the Secret Services Account found nothing untoward 
with the transaction.” 
He goes further to state: 
“That the necessary report in this regard was given 
to the Joint Standing Committee in Intelligence and 
as such to Parliament.” 
That is what he states as a fact in this memorandum to Advocate 
Ferreira, Breytenbach and Mzinyati.  Based on that I had a meeting 
with Ms Alice Miller who is corporate executive and others from the 
office of the AG and I enquired about this statement – this 
10 
memorandum that Advocate Mrwebi wrote. I gave them a copy and I 
gave them access to the memorandum and I asked them whether is this 
actually did this happen?  Which is important to me if it happened and 
they said there was nothing wrong then obviously that – that is the end 
of it.  And they denied that such a report was ever tabled at Parliament 
and that an investigation was ever done by them in respect of this 
specific transaction.  So to me that was clear that that was the 
memorandum in terms of Advocate Mrwebi where he states as a fact – a 
known fact that that was not true; that was untrue.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you got to know that situation at the time?  In 
20 
other words at the time when these things were happening you carried 
out this investigation to find out and then you were told there was no 
such memorandum and there was no such investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  So based 
on the memorandum that Advocate Mrwebi wrote. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 54 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I went to the Auditor General and 
I asked him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Did this in fact happen? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And they said it did not happen 
like that.  They never investigated that specific issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you then either yourself or through General 
Dramat go back to the NPA to say this is not correct. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I – we are jumping a little 
bit but I think there is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   There is a letter after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will get to it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Again – ja by General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Referring the matter back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us follow the right sequence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Being very alert to the time if I can 
20 
just close off this point Chair.  Can I ask you to turn to page 194 
please?   
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we have gone past the… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Past tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tea break but maybe let us take the tea break at half 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 55 of 233 
 
past – let us just finish what you have. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I [indistinct] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 19? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   194.  Is this the letter from the AG – 
Auditor General of South Africa’s office that asserted clarity to the 
query that you raised to them? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and if I 
may? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    
10 
“The purpose of this communication is to inform you 
that the Auditor General of South Africa not 
[indistinct] did not examine the alleged criminal 
transaction nor reach the relevant conclusion as set 
out in your letter dated to us the 11 t h July 2012.  
Yours sincerely Alice Miller Corporate Executive.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then if we turn to page 48 of 
your affidavit.  Having already addressed the response by Ms Jackie 
Lapinka is it correct that there was a ministerial task team that was set 
up to investigate allegations against General Mdluli? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just before that let us – let us just tie 
this.  You – you said that you understand that certain high ranking 
officials of the police service had a meeting with Advocate Mrwebi 
where they explained to him how certain things at Intelligence work – I 
cannot remember what you said. Do you want to repeat that and then 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 56 of 233 
 
confirm whether that is true and who those are if you know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I was informed and this is 
where it gets a little bit confusing to me.  I was informed that Advocate 
– that General Lazarus and Colonel Barnard went to see Advocate 
Mrwebi.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And they explained to him this is 
what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I – well I am under the impression 
10 
there is more than this – those two – there were other individuals as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At the hearing and I want to take 
this a little bit further.  Advocate – at the Mokgoro hearing.  He took it 
further – I mean he then – he did not in his memorandum address the 
names. I got to through my information I got to know who it was and 
then he at the hearing itself he said that General Dramat gave him that 
feedback regarding the Auditor General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And that he said to him that the 
matter was investigated and finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Dramat has subsequently 
testified at the Mokgoro Inquiry that that did not happen.  He never had 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 57 of 233 
 
that information.  He would never have given that to – to Advocate 
Mrwebi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Hm.  Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   You were about to inform the Chair 
about your knowledge on the ministerial task team that was appointed 
to investigate allegations – General Mdluli’s allegations.  Can you 
please do so? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do not know much about 
the – I know the task team was constituted by Minister Mthethwa on the 
11 t h May 2012 and the Chief Law Chief State Law Advisor Mr Enver 
10 
Daniels was to investigate the claims by General Mdluli that there was 
a so called plot against him.  The only feedback I ever received in 
respect of this task team was the media release by SAPS on the 5 t h 
July 2012 stated that there is no substance to General Mdluli’s claims 
of conspiracy.  The task team apart from clearing the alleged 
conspirators also found that the source who gave General Mdluli’s 
information could not be corroborated – could not corroborate it.  The 
so called source is FM09 stationed at Crime Intelligence and is a close 
confidant and friend or confidant of General Lazarus and General 
Mdluli.  My opinion of this is I am of the opinion that this plot was 
20 
fabricated to use as part of General Mdluli’s representations made to 
Advocate Mrwebi and to the SAPS.  I did not have sight of this task 
team report.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So – but this particular ministerial 
task team focussed on the cons – the alleged conspiracy theory of 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 58 of 233 
 
General Mdluli, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair and I am – if 
I can remember correctly the focus of the investigation was General 
Dramat, General Lebeya, General Petros.  I think there were one or two 
others as well which I cannot remember off hand now. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Having given evidence… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Who was General Petros 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   General Petros was the Provincial 
Commissioner of Gauteng at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And when you say the focus of the investigation 
10 
was on those three were – you mean were they the people who were 
suspected of having – of conspiring against General Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair they were 
according to General Mdluli they were masterminding this plot.  You will 
remember that when I mentioned General Petros’  name was with the  
first meeting on the 20 – I think it was the 21 s t or the 23 r d March 2011 
in Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I thought there was some interference with the 
recording but I think it has stopped.  So – so – yes – so that – those 
were the people who were suspected of conspiring against him? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As I said there might be more but 
I cannot remember off hand the other… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 59 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   the other individuals’ names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know who were others of the task team other 
than Mr Enver Daniels? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair I do not – I do not know 
who he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you know whether this particular task team 
was announced publicly by the then Minister of Police? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair as far as I know it was 
10 
announced publicly hence I think that is why there was a media release 
after the hearings but there was no report that was released as far as I 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now you said that the – you referred to a 
conclusion that there was no basis for that allegation of conspiracy.  
What were you referring to in terms of that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I was referring to the conspiracy 
against General Mdluli by these three officers and others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I mean is who had reached that 
conclusion? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was – it was Mr Enver Daniels 
from the – from that task team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh how did you get to know that because I 
understand you said that the – the – their report was not made public? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I am referring to paragraph 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 60 of 233 
 
162.1 there was a media release on the 5 t h July 2012 by SAPS media 
centre stating there is no substance to the General Mdluli’s claims of 
conspiracy.  The task team apart from cleaning the alleged conspirators 
also found that the source who gave General Mdluli’s information could 
not corroborate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the report was not made public but there was a 
media statement issued? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which told the public what the outcome of the 
investigation by that task team was. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is – that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I see the clock has ticked just 
past half past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is this a convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment.  It is now half past 
we will resume at quarter to twelve.  We adjourn. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  We are on page 48 
of your affidavit in particular we have just completed paragraph 162.  
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 61 of 233 
 
Much of what you say here after you have already testified to.  So just 
for the record in terms of time and context is it correct that on 
7 June 2012 General Dramat appealed again to Advocate Jiba to 
urgently review the decision of Advocate Mrwebi? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember we did cover that … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the following paragraph. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is therefore also correct that 
on the 2 n d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No do not repeat it.  We did cover it.  Continue. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it please … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember we covered that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  After then 
receiving information from General Dramat on the meeting that was had 
that all matters were sufficiently resolved.  Did you take any steps to 
progress the investigation or rather the criminal matter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  I wrote to 
Advocate Ferreira from the Serious Commercial Crime Unit to inform 
him of the meeting between General Dramat and Advocate Jiba that 
took place on 1 August 2012 and to seek clarity on the current position. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 2-0-7 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You say you went to him to brief him on 
the meeting between General Dramat and Ms Jiba and to seek - I think 
you said and to seek something.  I did not hear what you said. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 62 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To seek clarify on the current 
situation.  Practical issues that needs to be - that needs to be dealt 
with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and what did he say? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is she referring you to something that will help 
you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I - I think so.  I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Go - go ahead. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 2-0-7 appears a letter and 
10 
this is a letter that was authored by yourself addressed to 
Advocate J Ferreira dated 10 August 2012.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is the basis of this letter? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second please. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry Chair.  Page 2-0-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The way to deal with this is first for - for him to tell us 
what transpired at the meeting between him and Mr Ferreira.  If what 
transpired at that meeting was subsequently recorded in a letter then 
you - you can get to that but let us finish with what transpired at that 
20 
meeting which might be what you deal with in a letter then but then you 
can say that was subsequently recorded in a letter dated blah, blah, 
blah. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I - I might have made a - I 
did not have a meeting.  I wrote a letter. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 63 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you wrote a letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I wrote a letter to Advocate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I thought - I thought you said you went to him.  
So I must have misunderstood you then. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Sorry Chair.  I probably went to 
him afterwards but in terms of this I wrote him a letter to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To tell him what happened at the 
meeting with the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No then - then we deal with the letter. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what is the crux of this letter 
Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Basically Chair all that I did in 
terms of this letter I informed him about a meeting with - with - between 
Advocate Dramat 
and 
Advocate 
- 
sorry 
General Dramat 
and 
Advocate Jiba and I recorded the view of Advocate Jiba as relayed to 
me by General Dramat.  That the - (clearing throat) excuse me - and I 
will read from the letter.  Paragraph 2. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “Advocate Jiba is of the 
view that the matter against General Mdluli and 
Colonel Barnard accused in the matter was only 
provisionally withdrawn on 14 December 2011 due 
to the fact that some investigations had not been 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 64 of 233 
 
finalised.  I was further informed that I had to 
provide the case docket to the relevant prosecutor 
with the view of 
finalising 
the 
investigation.  
Thereafter the matter must be placed back on the 
court roll.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next paragraph could you read 
that into the record as well please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the - is the …? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the next paragraph in the statement now or in the 
10 
letter? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On - still on page 2-0-7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-0-7.  Yes continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “I was further informed 
that I had to provide the case docket to the relevant 
prosecutor 
with 
the 
view 
of 
finalising 
the 
investigation.  Thereafter the matter must be placed 
back on the court roll.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you and was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you make him read that a second time?  I thought 
20 
he did read that before. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I may … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Roelofse am I right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I am not getting involved in 
… 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 65 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies to that Chair.  I thought he 
just read the first paragraph.  Humble apologies.  What - what - is it 
correct then that the matter proceeded accordingly and the matter was 
in fact placed on the court roll and this is the very investigation that 
you have already given evidence about? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair the matter was not placed 
back on the court roll soon after this letter.  It was only placed back 
after the FUL application on the court roll where the decision was taken 
not that the - that the previous decision was - was wrong.  So what had 
happened … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was set aside? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes was set aside.  That is correct 
Chair.  So what had happened here is prosecutors were allocated and 
we - we took it from there but the matter was not placed back on the 
court roll.  By this time - and I think it is important to put this into 
context now - by this time the information that was given to me by 
Colonel Naidoo has been added to this investigation. 
So in terms of that there were still investigations that were 
outstanding that we had to finalise.  So the initial investigation was 
dealt with.  The one with Barnard and the - and the vehicle and 
20 
General Mdluli but in terms of - in light of the additional investigations 
we added it to this investigation and to complete - and to complete it as 
a whole in - to place it back on the court roll. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so just for the record Chair the 
High Court judgment handed down by Justice Murphy is dated 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 66 of 233 
 
23 September 2013 which was eventually taken on appeal and that 
judgment through Justice Brand who was Acting at the time was handed 
down on 17 April 2014 and it was then pursuant to the Supreme Court 
of Appeal decision that further steps were taken.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now how exactly would you describe 
your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are those judgments here?  Tell - tell me 
where they are. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sure Chair.  They are in bundle or 
10 
rather EXHIBIT 2.4 - KK2.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The first … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Judgment which is the High Court 
judgment is under Tab 8 which starts at page 2-8-2 and Chair with 
reference to the - the hand - the typed note that I passed up earlier this 
morning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
The 
relevant 
paragraphs 
are 
20 
mentioned in there as it pertains to this particular investigation and in 
particular the decision to withdraw these charges by Advocate Mrwebi.  
The SCA judgment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You see what I wanted you to do - I mean I - I 
will read the - each one of the judgments.  I will - those that I might not 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 67 of 233 
 
have recently - I will read them as a whole.  What I was saying earlier 
on was at the hearing if certain issues are already covered by a 
judgment that is not being appealed that is the final judgment in regard 
to a particular matter. 
You can just announce those findings that are important or 
relevant for our purposes.  That these were the findings.  These were 
the - this was the order that was made and then the witness can give 
evidence only for purposes of context or where there were gaps that 
were not dealt with in - in the judgment.  So - but you - you just say 
there was this judgment. 
10 
It is not being appealed against or it is not - no appeal is 
pending and this was the issue.  This is what was found.  Then we can 
move on. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would you like me to would you like 
me to address this now or …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - but you - you might not have … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I - should I do this after the long 
adjournment? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You might not have prepared to do - to do that.  
We - we can do that later or if you want to draw his attention to 
particular parts of the judgment you may do so but where there is a - a 
judgment which has made certain findings we do not have to go through 
that.  You can just say these were the findings that were made. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 68 of 233 
 
There was no further appeal and then the witness will simply 
give evidence in terms of context if there is anything on context that 
needs to be given or fill up gaps that may not have been dealt with in 
the judgment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  I am happy to do 
so later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And we can address it then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In closing this particular part of your 
10 
evidence Colonel - Mr Roelofse how would you - how would you 
describe your experience as the investigator in this matter on the 
engagements you have had through the Office of the National 
Prosecuting Authority? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I will - it was strange.  I had 
- I had - I was fortunate enough to be part of the Scorpions - the DSO 
but I closely worked with prosecutors and I have never encountered 
something like this before and to me that is why I felt at the time when 
the decision was taken and the reasons that were advanced for this - 
for those decisions it just - just does not make sense and normally 
20 
when you a policeman you do not necessarily taken on the NPA 
regarding decisions but this was so clearly wrong for me that I - that I 
had to take it on and - and hence the reason why I asked 
General Dramat to ask them to review the decision because the - it just 
did not make sense to me. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 69 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And sir is it then your evidence that 
you encountered resistance in progressing this particular criminal 
investigation through the - through the Justice System? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I think I would go further 
than that.  It is not just resistance.  It was - this was a - a deliberate 
attempt not to continue with the investigation and the - and I think it 
was thought that if and that is normally what happens that if the NPA 
say to the South African Police Service the matter is closed the matter 
will not be dealt with - would not be investigated further. 
Although that is not necessarily the case.  You can - you can 
10 
always investigate the matter further until you find the evidence that 
would have the NPA reconsider the decision but in this regard to me it 
was deliberate to stop the investigation and I base that on the letters 
that was written and our request that we - that we made at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then - then in your experience 
who was this - were there any key individuals who was the source of 
those deliberate attempts to stop the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as far as I am concerned 
from the NPA side I can speculate in terms of Advocate Jiba.  So I do 
not know whether she actually saw the documents or not.  So I rather 
20 
not venture into - in- in respect of her but in terms of Advocate Mrwebi 
he knew exactly what happened. 
He was briefed by policemen involved in the alleged 
criminality.  He should have known that it is not the way to deal with 
that matter.  He did not consult with either myself or the prosecutor in 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 70 of 233 
 
the matter and - and therefore under those circumstances I felt that this 
was done deliberately with the view of stopping the investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that you gave evidence 
at the Mokgoro Commission in relation to Advocate Mrwebi and 
Advocate Jiba? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair for the record the relevant 
paragraphs to that particular report does appear as Annexure 21 to his 
affidavit which starts at two - 2-11 - page 2-11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 2-11? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair.  It is not the entire 
unabridged report but really only that sections which relates to the 
evidence of this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This - the full unabridged report has 
already been placed before this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then turn to page 50 of 
your affidavit please. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if - if I may just before we 
20 
turn to page 50 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Which I actually should have 
mentioned earlier.  In fact I felt so strong about the decision that was 
taken and the interference - interference that we experienced that at 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 71 of 233 
 
the time I opened a criminal docket - a case docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In 2013 for investigation and my 
complaint was firstly perjury in terms of Advocate Mrwebi during the 
disciplinary of Advocate Breytenbach … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And then also against - and 
interfering with the investigation itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Defeating the ends of justice in 
10 
terms of Advocate Mrwebi as well as General Mdluli and the reasons 
why I opened the docket against General or why I supplied an affidavit 
against General Mdluli which included him is after his reinstated being 
- after he was reinstated he did certain actions which I will deal with 
later in the - in my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay.  No that is fine but I have just 
remembered something and I would like some clarification.  You said at 
some stage earlier that you understood that the so called higher 
ranking police officers who went to see Advocate Mrwebi to explain how 
certain things work under the intelligence.  You said you understood 
20 
those to have included Lazarus and Barnard? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You - you - but you said there probably were 
others that you do not know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair, yes. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 72 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now do - do you know how it had come about that 
they went to see him?  At whose initiative? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I - I - that I cannot answer.  
I would - I would presume it would have been on the initiative on 
General Lazarus … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Or his - his legal representative … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because as - the meeting took 
place at the NPA.  So I … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Based on that I would presume it 
was done by - by Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you or maybe before I - we proceed.  
We have passed the stage where we were dealing with matters that are 
dealt with in Judge Murphy’s judgment and Judge Brand’s judgment.  In 
Judge Murphy’s judgment there is reference to a letter that Mr Mdluli is 
said to have written to the former President in 2011 where he said 
something like if I come back I will help you or assist you. 
Do we have a complete - copy of a complete - that complete 
20 
letter in the bundle or do we not have it? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No we do not Chair.  In fact it is one 
of the letters that I have queried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the Mokgoro Commission they 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 73 of 233 
 
refer to the letter per se in the time chronology but they only do so with 
reference to the judgment itself.  We have been encountering 
difficulties in finding that particular letter.  This particular witness does 
however talk to a letter in the same month and same year.  With your 
leave I could take you to it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, but … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But the date of the letter appears to 
be different and it certainly does not present to be the same letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has somebody checked the court papers in the - in 
the full application because I - I assume that in referring to it and 
10 
quoting a sentence from it Judge Murphy would have seen the letter.  
Unless the letter was not attached but somebody had quoted the letter 
and nobody had disputed that that - there was such a letter and that it 
said what was quoted. 
Has somebody checked the - the court application in the full 
matter? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the first place to check.  Will you arrange for 
somebody to check? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and actually if we do not already have we should 
have the full papers in the full matter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will - will attend to it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 50 of your affidavit you now 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 74 of 233 
 
deal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry again Ms September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it will be important when you look at 
Judge Murphy’s judgment for purposes of just mentioning the important 
conclusions or findings.  It will be important to check whether he made 
any finding that the decision by Advocate Mrwebi to withdraw the 
charges that the charges being withdrawn.  Whether it was meant to be 
a permanent decision or not - final decision or not. 
I am - I am imagining that if the withdrawal of the charges 
10 
was provisional it would be difficult to - to see why the court would set 
that decision aside - a provisional decision.  Unless the court came to 
the conclusion that even if it was provisional it was so bad that it 
should be set aside because normally if it is - if it is a provisional 
withdrawal of charges it means the charges can be brought back once 
whatever evidence was thought to be outstanding has been found as 
being collected. 
So I thought I would just alert you that I am interested in that 
part as well. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There was a question about whether 
or not the court did in fact have reviewability powers in relation to a 
provisional decision as compared to a final decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 75 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And although the High Court did not 
agree with the judgment of Justice Navsa - I cannot remember the 
particular case right now - which said that there is really no difference 
between a provisional as opposed to final decision on the withdrawal of 
charges.  The Supreme Court of Appeal found that - in fact followed the 
- the SCA decision and the judgment of Navsa but I will look into the 
particularity of it and revert Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 50 of your affidavit.  How would 
you describe the cooperation of Mdluli in the investigations? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Describe 
- 
describe 
the 
cooperation of General Mdluli? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The cooperation of General Mdluli in 
the investigations. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Well I did not get any cooperation 
from General Mdluli in the investigation.  He did his best to frustrate 
the investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how did he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess - I guess maybe there may be some 
unfairness in talking about cooperation in relation to him when the 
20 
investigation is against him and he is a suspect because what 
obligation would there be or a suspect to assist the police to get him 
prosecuted.  That is meant for you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 76 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair my understanding is that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you used the word cooperation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Yes 
I 
did 
indeed 
and 
my 
understanding is that where charges have in fact been laid against any 
particular individual it would be expected that any particular - that 
particular individual would assist the police as far as possible without 
impeding or prejudicing their own rights to do so and it is in that 
context that I ask a question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In what way.  He has a right to remain silent. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in what way can he assist? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it leads then to the - to the 
answer that this witness has given.  Insofar as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but it gives … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It frustrated the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It gives an impression - it may unfairly give a 
negative impression to Mr Mdluli’s position because it suggests there 
was an obligation on him to cooperate and if by cooperating it is meant 
that he must assist the police in their investigation that might be 
problematic. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  My choice of word was certainly not 
to suggest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That he was to do so in any prejudice 
to his own rights … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 77 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so I will rephrase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well maybe you might want to put it in a way 
that would reflect what you have in mind. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How did General Mdluli involve 
himself in the investigation if at all? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair General Mdluli did - did not 
assist in the investigation as is - as is his right but he did frustrate the 
investigation by certain actions which he took during a specific 
timeframe. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think that - that is the part that maybe relevant 
insofar as if the evidence is he sought to frustrate the investigation.  
That is - that is different.  Yes.  In what way did he - what did he do 
that you regard it as frustrating the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair what happened is that he 
was - his suspension was lifted.  General Mdluli’s suspension was lifted 
on 31 March 2012 and he then continued with his duties as the 
Divisional Commissioner Crime Intelligence.  During that period that he 
was - that he - that he went back to work I was informed by Crime 
Intelligence members - various of them quite a few of them - that 
20 
General Mdluli set in motion a drive to identify those CI members who 
assisted me in the investigation - the Crime Intelligence investigation. 
The result thereof is that more than 20 members of Crime 
Intelligence were transferred within days after his reappointment.  
People which he thought of or suspected of assisting me.  On 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 78 of 233 
 
4 April 2012 General … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean - I am sorry.  You say people that he thought 
were assisting you in your investigation were transferred? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  On 
4 April 2012 General Mdluli released a circular to all Crime Intelligence 
members for signature warning them not to disclose classified 
information to the media and other persons or bodies not authorised to 
receive such - such information. 
This circular together with a transfer of members led to a 
situation where members of Crime Intelligence were no longer willing to 
10 
assist me even to - to assist me - even to assist in supplying affidavits 
relating to the chain of evidence testimony.  General Mdluli’s actions 
are not only tantamount to intimidation but also obstructing a lawful 
criminal investigation.  A copy of the circular is attached as per KDR22. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And then can I ask you to turn to 
page 2-6-3 please?  Chair we apologise for the - the bold print - bold 
copy of this document but it appears to still be legible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me get there first.  Yoh, this is bad.  You must try 
and get somebody who can read this to type it - retype it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Will do so Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is this the circular that was - that you 
referred to Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And is it correct that this circular is 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 79 of 233 
 
dated 04/04/2012? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  Merely four 
days after being reinstated. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is titled “Disclosure of 
Classified Information Crime Intelligence”? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would you like to …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you - in paragraph 170 which you have read - 
read - which you have read out you - you seem to be critical of that - of 
that circular but from what you have quoted in paragraph 70 - 170 it 
10 
seems that General - General Mdluli said nothing more than what the 
law requires of people.  Namely they should not divulge classified 
information to people not authorised to have that information. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that is - that is correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But I – the reason why I placed 
this document here is the fact that it needs to be understood in the 
timeframe when this happened it was the timeframe where we were 
getting or I was getting a lot of resistance in assistance from SAPS in 
general and it’s also the timeframe where members were transferred 
20 
and the other persons and bodies, not authorised to receive such 
information, for me it’s a clear indication that he was referring to the 
DPCI or the Hawks not to receive further information.  That is how I 
read it and how I understood it.  There’s a further letter which reflects 
on me as a person which will probably inform the Chair why I would 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 80 of 233 
 
read this in this manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The transfer of certain people, do you want to talk 
more in terms of whether you’re talking about a situation where people 
were being transferred to faraway places where maybe, further 
communication with you would be difficult? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I’m not referring to that kind 
of transfers, it would be a transfer from - you would work in an 
Intelligence Gathering Unit doing your normal day-to-day function and 
then you get transferred to a SAP13 store or a store where goods are 
being protected.  In other words your relevance becomes then null and 
10 
void. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you are moved from your normal job? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To another section or unit and because you are now 
in another unit whatever information that person would have been able 
to give to you, while he remained where he was, he can’t give it to you 
now because he’s somewhere else? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair but to put it 
into context when those individuals were removed they weren’t put into 
in – if you talk about levels they were put into, in their minds, and I  
20 
agree with them into a lower level, in other words a responsibility that 
they had was basically taken away from them and they were placed in a 
position where there is actually no responsibility, also no access to 
documentation in other words they would not be able to assist me in 
any event, that is the second part of what was achieved through that.   
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 81 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he is, part of what you are saying that those 
people who were transferred who had been assisting you were 
victimised? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But apart from being victimised you say once they 
had been moved from the positions where they had been helping you, 
they could no longer help you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because in order to help you they needed to have 
been in the same positions where they were? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Correct Chair, they need to have 
access to the relevant information and documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were other people then put in the positions from 
which they had been removed or is that something that you don’t know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I would assume so, I don’t 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse would an example of 
exactly what you are referring to be when Colonel Nelson was 
appointed to replace General Hankel? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Can you please take the Chair 
through what happened in this instance? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair, after the removal of 
General Hankel, there was a Colonel Nelson appointed to assist me 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 82 of 233 
 
with the – from Crime Intelligence side with the investigation.  Nothing 
came from that situation because he was never in a position to assist 
me, he was never allowed to assist me.  After the reinstatement of 
General Mdluli I contacted Colonel Nelson, it was on the 4 t h of May 
2012 to get access to documentation which I needed in the criminal 
investigation.  I also informed him at the time that discuss my request 
with General Mdluli as the head of Crime Intelligence at the time.  I 
informed him that – I informed General Colonel Nelson that if General 
Mdluli refused the information, General Mdluli must indicate the 
reasons for refusal in writing.  On the 6 t h of May General Nelson 
10 
informed me that General Mdluli wanted a letter from me, confirming I 
was continuing with the investigation.  I referred his request to General 
Dramat and the decision was taken not to respond to the request from 
General Mdluli and again I found myself in the position where I have to 
request documentation from a suspect in a specific matter.  On the 7 t h 
of May General Mdluli addressed a letter to General Mkhwanazi who 
was till the acting National Commissioner at the time and General 
Dramat under the heading, soliciting of information from Crime 
Intelligence, Colonel Roelofse in which he accuses me of unethical 
conduct, unethical and unfounded behaviour and bad intentions.  The 
20 
document attached is Annexure 23 and on that same day Nelson was 
transferred to another division in which he has no experience within CI. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you Mr Roelofse to turn to 
page 267 please, is that the letter that you refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 83 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can you please inform what the gist 
of the letter is and that paragraph which really talks to it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair basically the – it’s a very 
short letter and the whole letter talks to what had happened there.  So I 
would start with paragraph two, 
 
“It is reported that he, and that is now referring to me, 
 
approached the previously appointed liaison to obtain further 
 
classified information from divisions record explicitly stating 
 
that the case is re-opened.  This unethical and unfounded 
 
behaviour is indicative of the bad intentions associated with 
10 
 
the member concerned.  I think it’s common knowledge that the 
 
relevant bodies, namely the Inspector General of Intelligence 
 
and 
the 
Auditor 
General 
have 
been 
tasked 
with 
the 
 
investigation surrounding the issues of Crime Intelligence.  
 
Therefore, the behaviour of the member is sufficient proof of 
 
his devious intentions.  We are all aware of the leakage of 
 
classified information to the media and this type of behaviour 
 
has a compounding effect to the current situation.  It would be 
 
much appreciated if you could kindly inform the persons 
 
involved to refrain from this unprofessional and intimidating 
20 
 
tactics being displaced.  To this end I have instructed all 
 
personnel within Crime Intelligence not to provide any 
 
information so solicited and that any such attempts be 
 
immediately reported”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it would be correct, would it not be that to the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 84 of 233 
 
extent that he was talking about classified information there would be 
nothing wrong in  him saying to the National Commissioner, please talk 
to Mr Roelofse or everyone concerned to say they mustn’t approach 
people and ask them to give them classified information because as I 
understand it, that could be interpreted to mean he was saying, if you 
want classified information follow the procedure that must be followed 
to get it declassified and then you can get the information but don’t get 
people to act in breach of their classification instruments or laws? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it could be interpreted like 
that but unfortunately in this specific instance this is exactly why 
10 
Colonel Nelson was appointed for that procedure to take place.  I 
followed the procedure and that is his response on the procedure that I 
wanted to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this is where you come in with the complaint that 
he was frustrating the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And specific to the first sentence in 
paragraph four where he says, 
 
“I think that it is common knowledge that the relevant bodies, 
20 
 
namely the Inspector General of Intelligence and the Auditor 
 
General have been tasked with the investigations surrounding 
 
the issue of Crime Intelligence”. 
 
In fairness to this letter, bearing in mind that this letter is in 
fact dated the 7 t h of May 2012, it would be correct that the mandate of 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 85 of 233 
 
the IGI was clarified on the 19 t h of March 2012 which preceded the date 
of this letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Whereas the letter from the Auditor 
General of South Africa, which is dated the 25 t h of July 2012 succeeds 
this letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything – he says in that first sentence of 
paragraph 
four 
of 
his 
letter 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
the 
same 
thing[indistinct] whether he has said or where he has said either before 
10 
or after. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry Chair I missed the first 
part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you read that first sentence in paragraph four of 
his letter about the Auditor General and the Inspector General, is here 
anything he says in that first sentence that seems to be the same as 
what – I don’t know where he said either before or after in trying to 
justify his decision to withdraw the charges? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the reasons used in 
paragraph four is exactly the same reason that was advanced by 
20 
Advocate Magwebe, in fact, or the Inspector General has already 
clarified but Advocate Magwebe at this point in time has not conceded 
yet to the fact that either the IGI nor the Auditor General had not 
conceded that it’s their responsibility.  So he would follow that he would 
then say this if he has been either in contact or he knows what the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 86 of 233 
 
decision is of Advocate Magwebe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that was what I was wondering, why there was – 
they may have been saying the same thing. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I can revert you back to 
the representations that was made right in the beginning there were 
contract between Advocate Magwebe and General Mdluli right from the 
start, that is not – I strongly believe that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you mean at the time when both of the knew 
that he was a suspect and there was an investigation going on? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair otherwise he 
10 
would not have known all the information that he states in paragraph 
four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that should not have happened, should it – 
should it have happened? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair it should not have 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes if a suspect, is the position that if a suspect 
wants to make representations to the NPA for the withdrawal of charges 
then they make those representations in writing and you would get a 
copy so that you can counter if you want to counter or is that something 
20 
you’re not familiar with? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair in the cases that I’ve 
worked and the Prosecutors I’ve worked with that is the way it was 
dealt with, if there was a representation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is transparency normally? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 87 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   There is transparency, it’s not for 
me to say what needs to be done but it’s for me to ask my opinion in 
terms of – and he can either accept my opinion or he doesn’t have to 
accept it.  So that is normally what happens in the cases that I am 
involved in.  In this matter we haven’t – I’ve seen the document relating 
to the representation, I only saw afterwards so I wasn’t privy to them at 
the time and we were not requested to give an input. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse your evidence now 
turns to further experiences that you’ve had of non-cooperation with 
10 
police management, we’re on page 51 of your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Since when have you been unable to 
obtain documents from Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I have not been able to 
retrieve any documentation since 19 March 2012 after the finding of the 
IGI and I believe this is a direct result of General Mdluli’s actions.  You 
will recall that I testified that there was a period that we did not 
continue with investigations while it was in the hands of the IGI to 
make a decision.  So after this date, the 19 t h, we have not received any 
20 
cooperation from Crime Intelligence in respect of documentation that 
was requested from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Isn’t the position that he either resigned or retired a 
few months ago or something? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I’m not mistaken he has 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 88 of 233 
 
retired, it was last year, he was on suspension after his re-suspension 
in, I think June 2012 so he was on suspension for six years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After he had retired did you make any attempt to get 
documents that you couldn’t get while he was there? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I made various attempts but 
not necessarily regarding new documents I made various attempts to 
get documents declassified.  At the time I gave up in getting additional 
documentation from Crime Intelligence I just wanted the ones that I do 
have to be declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m wondering whether his absence now will make 
10 
any difference in terms of you getting cooperation to have documents 
declassified, whether that has been tested or not? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it didn’t make any 
difference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not make any difference? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the problem as you see it was more than him? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who did you approach – rather, 
20 
firstly it is correct that on the 28 t h of May 2012 General Mdluli was re-
suspended after submitting representations as to why he should not be 
suspended? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who did you approach during 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 89 of 233 
 
July of 2012 for assistance within the police to obtain documents that 
you needed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the acting Divisional 
Commissioner of Crime Intelligence was Major General Chris Ngcobo 
and on the 5 t h of July I tried to – I tried to reschedule the meeting that I 
arranged for the 4 t h of July 2012 and it was cancelled without providing 
the reasons.  I sent a follow up written request on the 10 t h of July 2012 
calling for a meeting after trying several times to secure a meeting 
through his staff. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So was it that at least as early as 
10 
the 5 t h of July 2012 that you had approached Major General Ngcobo for 
assistance? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I probably approached him 
just before the 4 t h of July because the meeting was set down for the 4 t h 
which was cancelled. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happened towards the end of 
July that same year, 2012? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I was provided with an 
email, media enquiry, dated 11 t h July sent by Sam Sole a reporter from 
the Mail & Guardian which was addressed to Mrs Swele Mnisi, the 
20 
spokesperson of the Minister of police at the time and Major General 
Nonkululeka Bata who was the head of communications at SAPS.  The 
enquiry indicated to me that the SAPS management was aware of the 
allegations and I’m talking management now in the broader sense 
against members of CI.  They were also aware that I and 12 others are 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 90 of 233 
 
accused of placing the entire police service at risk to date.  I have not 
been approached by anyone to verify the allegations made in the email. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I then ask you to turn to page 
270, is the media query on email that you referred to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what is the purpose of 
highlighting this particular email to the Commission in the context of 
your evidence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do not know where Mr 
Sam Sole received his information from but there were certain 
10 
allegations made against myself as well as other people that was 
involved in the investigation, he must have received it from somewhere 
and the allegations that were made, and I would like to just point out a 
few of them, 
 
“Senior police managers are being targeted through various 
 
means including unhappy offices, media as well as the NGO’s”, 
 
He based his document or his questions on the document 
titled, extensive intelligence report, security threat to the State. It’s not 
dated but appears to have been drafted June 2012.  I do not have 
access to that specific report, I didn’t see the report and according to 
20 
Mr Sam Sole is our understanding is that the document was used for 
the verbal briefing to the Minister and possibly the IGI.  They state 
further that, 
 
“Nkhwanazi and Hankel want to intensify the campaign about 
the alleged love relationship between the Minister and the KZN 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 91 of 233 
 
Provincial Commissioner.  Nkhwanazi and Hankel are also investigating 
the purchase of a new vehicle driven by Buthelezi who was alleged to 
have a romantic relationship with the Minister. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   For the record that is Philisiwe 
Buthelezi, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must just spell some of these names so that the 
transcriber will know what to write otherwise when you read the record 
it just says something very strange. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Philisiwe Buthelezi 
10 
(name spelt).  Please proceed Mr Roelofse. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And then instructions were given 
to investigate General Ngcobo of VI Protection and General Dlala of the 
Presidential Protection Unit to give general Nkhwanazi and General 
Masimole control over those units, both men are being surveilled 
including by means of General Hankel’s grabber.  Other specific tasks 
in this regard were given to General Mathiba, Brigadier Mamosella and 
Brigadier Odendal and then it also reports to two meetings held by 
General Nkhwanazi with Crime Intelligence Management.  Chair I want 
to – there’s quite a few allegations here but I want to go to point 
20 
number 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Point number 20? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Point number 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The document states that, 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 92 of 233 
 
 
“13 people have been identified as involved in placing the 
entire police service at risk and then it states the following names, it’s 
Nkhwanazi, General Lebeya, General Dramat, General Masemolo, 
General 
Mathiba, 
General 
Hankel, 
General 
Sibeya, 
Brigadier 
Madonsella, Brigadier Odendal, Brigadier Khumalo, Colonel Roelofse, 
Lieutenant Colonel Viljoen and Warrant Office Maclean”. 
 
And then also I’ve been accused, the document accuses 
Colonel Roelofse of leaking documents to organisations outside the 
police and then in paragraph 23, 
 
“The document alleges that Gerrie Nel is receiving State 
10 
 
documents from the abovementioned members and supplying 
 
them to Adrian Basson of City Press”, 
 
Chair these are very serious allegations that were made by Mr 
Sam Sole, this was never investigated, I was never approached in 
respect of these allegations, I do not know what the police’s response 
was on these allegations, if this – if there was any basis for these 
allegations 
I 
assume 
it 
would 
have 
been 
investigated 
and 
consequences would have followed. So from where I stand in terms of 
my experience that I had with Crime Intelligence and the way things 
were done, the document was drafted in order to implicate individuals 
20 
to put pressure on those individuals for them to – they want to make 
sure that those individuals cannot continue with their – with whatever 
they need to do because the individuals mentioned here that is part of 
this [indistinct] are all people initially involved with the investigation in 
terms of the Crime Intelligence Secret Services Account. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 93 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it then correct that this document 
at least as far as the recipients are concerned marks a date of 
awareness of allegations within the context of the Crime Intelligence 
Division? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   At the very least Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On the 14 t h of May 2013 you 
received a request to compile a report from the office of General 
Dramat, we are back on page 52 of your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair I was – I 
received an email from General Dramat’s office asking assistance to 
10 
compile a report as requested in the [indistinct] email authored by 
General Nkhwanazi on 14 May 2013.  At this point in time General 
Nkhwanazi was not the acting National Commissioner, the then National 
Commissioner General Riah Phiyega required the compilation of a 
consolidated report in respect of the various topics addressed in the 
email.  I state further that it is clear to me that SAPS senior 
management had knowledge of, and the clear understanding of the 
seriousness of various allegations including the murder investigation, 
irregular appointment within Crime Intelligence and allegations against 
senior officials from Crime Intelligence.  A copy of the email trail is 
20 
attached as Annexure KDI25.  I did not – I did respond this request, I 
do not know if General Dramat submitted the report, I have not seen 
the report General Nkhwanazi had to compile. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Before we turn to this particular 
Annexure it would be a fair statement to say that the SAPS senior 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 94 of 233 
 
management 
that 
you 
refer 
to 
who 
found 
knowledge 
in 
this 
communication are those who are then reflected in the email itself? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 273 
please, because it is a trailing email the first email or rather the main 
email appears at the bottom of page 273 sent from Lieutenant General 
Nkhwanazi on the 14 t h of May 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like I went to a wrong page.  I went to 373 – 
you said 273? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   273 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The main email is as a trailing email 
– as part of this trailing email appears at the bottom of this page which 
is sent by Lieutenant General N S Mkhwanazi spelt M-k-h-w-a-n-a-z-i 
and it is sent on the 14 t h May 2013 at 12.30 pm – sorry – and it is sent 
to Lieutenant General Lebeya the DPCI head Mazibuko Nkrumah if I am 
correct – pronouncing that correctly, Lieutenant General Molefe Julius, 
Lieutenant General D N C Operational Services, Mazimola S F 
Lieutenant General and the subject title is Investigation at the Division 
Crime Intelligence.   
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is addressed to all of these 
generals? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is quite a long email but what is 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 95 of 233 
 
the essence of this email that is sent to the generals? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I will just – in short just I 
will not be able to summarise it but I will take bullet points from the – 
from the email itself in terms of what the report needs to cover.   
It needs to cover background information regarding Lieutenant General 
Mdluli’s murder and corruption cases.   
Information on other corruption cases i.e or e.g the case against Major 
General Lazarus.   
Background information about the appointment of investigation – 
investigators for all criminal investigations.   
10 
Background information against the registration of each disciplinary 
case or departmental enquiry. 
Background information regarding the alleged illegal appointments that 
were made at CI which were mentioned in the news. 
Background information which necessitated the appointment of the 
commission by the Minister which involved Lieutenant Dramat and 
Lieutenant General Lebeya, Lieutenant General Petros and anything 
relevant to shed some light on the CI cases. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if I could just interrupt you 
there.  It is quite a comprehensive email.  But the information that you 
20 
referred to now includes then matters happening within Crime 
Intelligence, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The rest of the email by and large 
addresses specific requests. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 96 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   To individual generals/ 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The first general being Lieutenant 
General Lebeya. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The next general being Lieutenant 
General Dramat. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Followed by Lieutenant General 
10 
Mazibuko, 
Lieutenant 
General 
Molefe 
and 
Lieutenant 
General 
Masimola. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this particular – if you go back 
to 2 – page 273 this email is an email that was sent to you by 
Lieutenant General Dramat, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And you were called upon to assist 
in the compilation of this report? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is then to be understood that 
your assistance was relative to your involvement as an investigator in 
these – in some if not most of these matters. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And accordingly just as with the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 97 of 233 
 
previous communication is it to be accepted that at least at the date of 
this email which is the 14 t h May 2013 these generals became aware of 
allegations within Crime Intelligence 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We back on page 52.  Is it correct 
that you continued communications with the Auditor General’s office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair I did 
continue.  I kept in contact with Ms Miller from the office of the Auditor 
General and on the 2 n d February 2015 I was provided with the SSA 
audit reports for the financial years 2004 to 2012 as part of the CI 
10 
criminal investigation.  In paragraph 1.6 – 176.1 the SAPS CI 
management responses to the audit queries raised by the Auditor 
General in 2012 are that they stated that they cannot comment as the 
matters are being investigated by the DPCI and as such sub-judice.  
The responses are in my view are disingenuous as management knew 
that an investigation into the transactions in question could not 
continue due to the lack of the cooperation that – that we faced and 
from the very management – and from the very management hiding 
behind the DPCI investigation.  A copy of that report 2012 is attached 
as KDR26. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair a copy of this report which has 
been declassified appears at page 277.  I need to alert Chair to the fact 
that there are certain aspects in this report which have been redacted 
because it does not specifically relate to the evidence of this witness. 
And that the purpose of this evidence is really to talk to the knowledge 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 98 of 233 
 
of the – of this particular report.  We now turn to your efforts to 
declassify documents.  Through your investigations did you establish 
any pattern of interference? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And how would you describe that 
pattern? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair from my experience in this 
specific investigation I am talking about the criminal – this Crime 
Intelligence investigation there has been a pattern of interference by 
General Mdluli and Advocate Mrwebi.  The allegations of criminal – of 
10 
alleged 
criminality 
within 
Crime 
Intelligence 
that 
have 
been 
investigated thus far do not include information regarding any project 
detail which could jeopardise said projects.  It deals mainly with the 
fraudulent procurement of assets via the SSA and the appointment of 
family and – or family members as agents without them having the 
required skills to be appointed in the first place.  This investigation is 
limited to a few individuals who form part of the procurement process 
and the management within Crime Intelligence.  On numerous 
occasions – numerous occasions I have asked General Dramat to 
secure the CI management – to secure CI managements cooperation 
20 
first in – firstly making CI members available to assist with the 
investigation and secondly to ensure that declassification of the 
required documents. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If you can pause there then.  There 
were two types of cooperation that you required.   
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 99 of 233 
 
1. Was the cooperation that you required from Crime Intelligence 
members to assist you in the investigation and  
2. It was actual documents that you needed for purposes of the – 
the investigation as well. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is – that is true Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And such documents is to tell to the 
evidence you presented yesterday was not only documents that you 
were provided by General Hankel but also documents that you had 
requested from the police in a declassified format. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Ja it is also documents that I also 
10 
requested from Crime Intelligence in a declassified format.  In other 
words documents that I identified that is needed in respect of the other 
allegations which I was also investigating and – and I asked for them in 
the declassified fashion. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So when you asked General Dramat 
to assist you let us go through the efforts that you made in trying to 
declassify these documents.  When you asked General Dramat to assist 
you what happened on the 7 t h March 2013? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair on the 7 t h March of 2013 
General Dramat forwarded a request for assistance to the previous 
20 
acting – previous acting divisional commissioner of Crime Intelligence 
General Ngcobo.  Even though this request did not deal with the 
declassification of classified documents it requested the assistance of 
members.  In support I attach a copy of General Dramat’s letter as 
Annexure KDR27. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 100 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to turn to page 325 
please?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   325 Chair.  Is that the letter that you 
refer to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And is it correct that in this 
paragraph 2 of this letter you inform – it is recorded that: 
“We are making a request for the granting of 
permission to interview members within the Crime 
10 
Intelligence division with the view of obtaining 
affidavits from them.” 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What subsequently happened? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Nothing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there no response to the letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair there might have been a 
response – I am sure there is response – I think it is just a little bit 
further but General Ngcobo did respond to the letter where he sets out 
what his problems are. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   But before that happened there was 
an additional letter also sent in March 2013.  If you can go back to 
page 53 of your affidavit.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Who prepared the letter that was 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 101 of 233 
 
sent out in March – also in March of 2013?  Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I am looking at the 
document it was prepared by General Dramat. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that the document then that 
appears at page 328 of your bundle? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair yes but I am actually 
referring to the previous – the previous letter which is the request for 
assistance.  The second letter would be the – a setting out of the 
documents that I needed for declassification purposes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   I am not following you Mr Roelofse.  
10 
You sent a letter or rather a letter was sent on the 7 t h March 2013 
through the office of General Dramat which is the letter that you 
referred to earlier at page 325, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And that particular letter requested 
the assistance of CI members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But if I go to paragraph 178.2 I – 
in my March 2013 I prepared –  
20 
“I prepared a draft letter to Brigadier Moodley the 
then acting National Head of the Anti-Corruption 
which would be my – which would be my direct boss 
or my direct head in terms of which office I worked 
regarding 
the 
declassification 
of 
classified 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 102 of 233 
 
documents.  I cannot recall the exact date of the 
letter which I am informed as – of the letter which I 
am informed was sent by General – Brigadier 
Moodley to General Dramat.  A copy of my draft letter 
is attached as KRD28 which I now refer to” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so if we go to page 328. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   328.  Is this the letter that you 
prepared Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is the letter that I prepared, 
10 
that is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this was the letter that you 
prepared for your senior Brigadier Moodley? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And it is the same letter that was 
sent onto the office of General Dramat as you were informed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And paragraph 3 of this letter reads: 
“It is requested that the National Commissioner 
declassify the following documents listed below in 
20 
order to facilitate the use of these documents in 
open court in the matter of State versus R N Mdluli 
and H J Barnard in respect of the – in respect of 
Silverton case 155/07/2011.” 
Paragaph 4. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 103 of 233 
 
“The documents in question were allegedly created 
to facilitate the committing of an offence/offences 
and presented facts to internal auditors and the 
Auditor General which were not entirely accurate.  
Had they knew the true nature of the expenditure 
they would have been able to identify the offences.” 
If one turns the page paragraph 6 informs: 
“That the authors cannot be approached since some 
are implicated in this matter.  And as far as could be 
established the authority to classify or declassify 
10 
documents has not been delegated to another official 
below the National Commissioner.” 
And it ends off at paragraph 8 which informs that: 
“It is also recommended that these documents be 
declassified in light thereof that the accused who 
were employees of Crime Intelligence do not use the 
grounds of classified information as a line of defence 
in open court.” 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As we will dis- as your evidence 
20 
unfolds was the declassification of documents or rather the absence of 
declassification used as a line of defence in courts? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I know… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me the National Commissioner of Police would he 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 104 of 233 
 
not have the final authority within CPS to override anybody’s decision 
relating to a refusal to declassify documents including documents held 
by Crime Intelligence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he has that authority.  In 
fact the authority lies with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The authority lies with him? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So must I understand your evidence when you say 
you have received no cooperation with regard to the declassification of 
certain documents to include that even he has not cooperated? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair.  In this 
regard I think it was she. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh at that time it was she? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is – General Phiyega. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As far as I can remember Chair I 
might be wrong with the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But as far as I can remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But with regard to the current National 
20 
Commissioner have attempts been made and have they been successful 
to get him to override any previous refusal to declassify information – 
documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair attempts have been made 
no declassification has taken place. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 105 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has taken place.  Yes.  Has there been responses to 
correspondence in this regard or there simply has been no response to 
requests resent there? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It is just no response Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No response? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair I note the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And ask if it is a convenient time to 
10 
have a long adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We are going to adjourn.  How is it looking in 
terms of our time?  In terms of finishing – there is still a supplementary 
affidavit to be dealt with as well or not? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just this one? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We currently on page 53 of a 72 
page affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we left with about 17 pages – or about 20 pages. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay do you… 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have an idea how long since we started we 
might be taking to do 20 pages? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It is hard to estimate at this stage. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 106 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Depends on the questions. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay no I just thought you might be able to say 
whether you think we might be able to finish by four o’clock or not but it 
is okay we will come back and we will continue and see how far we go. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   We would really appreciate to finish 
with this witness today bearing in the schedule tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us do what we can and we will see what we can 
– what is possibly at four as you may have gathered I am not too well 
so we will see how – how things go. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the lunch adjournment and we will 
resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Through you Chair would you like me 
to address you on the queries you raised earlier on the judgments or 
should I do so later? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can do it now or later.  Which one suits you? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We could address it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I must admit that this may not 
be an exhaustive list of all the findings but I did what I could in the 
adjournment to identify the findings within the High Court judgment as 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 107 of 233 
 
with the SCA to the extent that this particular witness can talk to it - 
talk to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will not help if there may be a chance there are 
others that you might discover later are important.  So the idea is that 
we should be able to see where the gaps are where the witness can 
come in. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair there are certain plea findings 
and certain points that I have been able to highlight which has been 
relevant to the evidence that has been led so far certainly so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja that - that is - that is all that we need namely 
10 
findings in the judgment that are relevant to what we are looking at … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then so that he can give some context if there is 
a need for context or fill in gaps that … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The litigation might not have dealt with. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What we - what I … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words the difficulty would be if you have 
not had time to go through the whole judgment and you might discover 
20 
later that there are other findings that are relevant and he is gone by 
then and then we might need him later.  So that is - that is the idea but 
if you are satisfied that the findings that you have identified are all 
those that are relevant for purposes of what we are looking at.  It is 
fine. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 108 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Certainly Chair.  As a way forward 
could I suggest subject to your direction of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That we address such findings which 
have been identified as quite key as to the evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To this particular witness’ evidence 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to the extent that I - that any 
10 
additional findings are sought to which a response is sought from him if 
he could then provide us with an affidavit - a supplementary affidavit to 
that effect? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think what we can do is do what you can and 
then later on let me know whether there are others that you had not 
picked up which you would have since picked up and then we will see 
whether the best thing would be for him to come back or to just provide 
an affidavit … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think going forward and do share it with other 
20 
members of the legal team.  Whenever in regard to any witness there is 
a judgment that is there that is available - that is relevant.  The best 
way is that there be an identification of findings or conclusions in the 
judgment that are relevant and those can be identified and read out 
without any reference really to the witness. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 109 of 233 
 
Except where there is a finding where the witness is asked to 
give context or where there are certain gaps namely matters that were 
not dealt with in the judgment which the witness can fill by way of 
evidence.  So that we do not need to go through the witness with the 
whole judgment or findings that were made. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair, Chair will recall that the High 
Court judgment which was handed down by Justice Murphy in Freedom 
Under Law vs the NDPP on 23 September 2013 was a judgment that 
10 
concerned the review application in relation to four decisions.  The four 
decisions first - the first decision of those four is the decision taken by 
Advocate Mrwebi on 5 December 2011 to withdraw the fraud and 
corruption charges against General Mdluli. 
The second decision was that of Advocate Chauke of the 
NDPP’s Office on 1 February 2012 to withdraw the murder and related 
charges somewhat in the region of 17 charges against General Mdluli 
and the third decision or rather the third and fourth decisions were both 
taken 
by 
the 
Acting 
Commissioner 
at 
the 
time 
who 
was 
General Mkhwanazi. 
20 
The first decision being taken on 29 February 2012 to 
withdraw the disciplinary proceedings against General Mdluli and the 
second 
decision 
of 
General Mkhwanazi 
was 
on 
the 
27 t h 
or 
28 March 2012 to reinstate General Mdluli as the Head of Crime 
Intelligence within SAPS. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 110 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To reinstate? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To reinstate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  General Mdluli as the Head of Crime 
Intelligence within SAPS.  In addition to that there were additional 
orders that was sought but - and those particular orders were sought to 
direct the reinstitution of the criminal and disciplinary proceedings 
without any further delay. 
Having said that those particular orders were overturned by 
the SCA and so will not necessarily be addressed and these orders 
10 
were sought in addition to ancillary orders of costs and the like sought.  
Mr Roelofse you are aware of these judgments.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And of those four decisions that I 
have alluded to which of those four decisions do you have personal 
experience about - personal experience of?  Sorry. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean which - which ones he has personal 
knowledge of? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I have personal knowledge 
regarding both the Vosloorus matter which is the Mdluli matter - murder 
matter as well as the Mdluli/Barnard matter which is the criminal - 
(clearing of throat) sorry - which is the criminal proceedings.  I do not 
have any direct - I did not have any direct - direct knowledge regarding 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 111 of 233 
 
the - the disciplinary matters.  I was not involved in that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in that regard you are referring 
to the two decisions of General Mkhwanazi.  The one being to withdraw 
the disciplinary proceedings.  The other to reinstate General Mdluli. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Before we deal with the first 
decision and that is of Advocate - Advocate Mrwebi I would just like to 
alert Judge to one point and that was a concession that was made on 
the papers by General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you do that I thought what you said you 
10 
were going to do was to tell me what the findings were. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did I misunderstand? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I think I may have misunderstood.  
Chair if I could - you could just bear with me then.  One concession 
that I think is important to bring your attention to Chair is that at 
paragraph 67 of the judgment it is mentioned that: 
“General 
- 
Advocate Mrwebi 
had 
provided 
an 
affidavit on the - the day before the matter was 
enrolled and as part of - of his supplementary 
20 
affidavit he was prepared to share with the court 
the fact that the National Prosecuting Authority has 
been experience - has experienced challenges in 
relation to the declassification of documents.” 
I bring that specifically to Judge’s attention in view of the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 112 of 233 
 
evidence relating to declassification.  The findings then are such that 
the court found: 
“Advocate Mrwebi took the decision to withdraw the 
charges 
against 
General Mdluli 
without 
the 
concurrence of Advocate Mzinyathi and decided to 
discontinue the prosecution.  In the result the court 
found that the decision failed to be set aside 
irrespective 
of 
its 
categorisation 
as 
- 
as 
administrative or not.  This decision was found to 
be legal for not complying with the duty to consult 
10 
the DPP.” 
The Supreme Court of Appeal in fact confirmed this in 
paragraphs 41 to 42 of the judgment where with your leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is much cleaner if you start with 
Judge Murphy’s judgment and say here are the findings or conclusions 
that I have identified as relevant one, two, three, four and then you go 
to the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and say here are the findings 
or conclusions that I have identified as relevant one, two, three, four 
and then you can highlight where maybe the Supreme Court of Appeal 
did not agree with the High Court but it is clean - it is much cleaner 
20 
that way. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Indeed Chair.  The - the next finding 
then is at paragraph 70 of the judgment where the court found that: 
“The fraud and corruption charges were formally 
and provisionally withdrawn in the Specialised 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 113 of 233 
 
Commercial Crimes Court on 14 December 2011.  
The court went so far as to say that Freedom Under 
Law submits that a provisional withdrawal which 
has endured for two years may be considered to be 
a permanent withdrawal.  The characterisation of 
the withdrawal as provisional …” 
As I explain later. 
“…would not normally deflect from any proven 
illegality or irrationality of the decision.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it make - did it make findings or conclusion - 
10 
reach any conclusions about Advocate Mrwebi’s basis for his decision? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember he said in correspondence that the 
investigation had to be conducted by Inspector-General and he said 
somewhere that on the merits there was - there were no reasonable and 
probable - there was no reasonable and probable cause for 
prosecution. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Certainly Chair to the extent that I 
was able to establish during the lunch break the one point in relation to 
the IGI is at paragraph 1-7-3 of the judgment which informed that: 
20 
“The purported referral to the IGI was equally 
misdirected.  The IGI’s oversight role over the 
Intelligence and Counter Intelligence Services is 
restricted to monitoring the compliance of the 
constitution 
and 
other 
laws 
and 
to 
receive 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 114 of 233 
 
complaints of misconduct.  As mentioned by the IGI 
in 
a 
letter 
of 
19 March 2012 
to 
the 
Acting 
Commissioner the IGI’s mandate does not extend to 
criminal investigations.” 
And so goes further to inform that: 
“Mrwebi’s decision to withdraw the fraud and 
corruption charges because he apparently believed 
them to fall within the exclusive purview of the IGI 
was accordingly based on a material error of law.  
Yet despite being aware of the IGI’s views as 
10 
appears from his reasons for - for decision dated 
12 July 2012 
he 
irrationally 
adhered 
to 
his 
position.” 
The - the court goes further to talk to the specific reasons 
which were advanced by Advocate Mrwebi when he decided to withdraw 
the charges and in so doing at paragraph 174 it informs that: 
“His decision was thus evidently based on errors of 
law and fact.  He took account of irrelevant 
considerations 
and 
ignored 
relevant 
considerations.” 
20 
At paragraph 175 in the middle of the paragraph it informs that: 
“The withdrawal of the charges he said was merely 
provisional to allow for further investigation to take 
place and this version was at odds with the 
contemporaneous reasons Mrwebi gave for his 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 115 of 233 
 
decision and the evidence of Breytenbach and 
Mzinyathi in the disciplinary proceedings. Even if 
the charges were supposedly provincially withdrawn 
in court Mrwebi’s pronouncements at the time 
evinced 
an 
unequivocal 
intention 
to 
stop 
proceedings all together.  He considered the 
referral to the IGI …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now that is - that is … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is an important one.  Yes. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  He - if I could start at the beginning 
of that sentence.  It says … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I - I am not so interest on the reasons.  I am 
just interested on the findings.  The reasons one can read later.  Just 
for purposes of seeing where the evidence of this witness will still be 
necessary. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair.  Apologies for 
the indulgence.  Those were the extent of the - oh and just finally Chair 
at page - at paragraph 176 it was found that: 
“The decision and instruction of Mrwebi to withdraw 
20 
the fraud and corruption charges must be set aside.  
It 
was 
illegal, 
irrational 
based 
on 
irrelevant 
considerations and material errors of law and 
ultimately so unreasonable that no reasonable 
prosecutor could have taken it.” 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 116 of 233 
 
That was the extent of the findings that I could find in respect 
of that decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you wish me to do the same in 
respect of the Vosloorus decision as well? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is something different that they found if you 
say they went along with the judgment of the High Court except in 
regard to A, B, C, D.  That should be enough. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair in fact the SCA confirmed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The basis and rational for the 
decisions 
- 
for 
- 
for 
the 
setting 
aside 
of 
the 
decision 
of 
Advocate Mrwebi but it did not specifically agree to setting aside the 
decision to withdraw the criminal charges but it did that off the back of 
an undertaking by the NDPP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To reinstitute the proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This particular witness has informed 
that he is not in a position to comment in relation to the disciplinary - 
20 
the withdrawal of disciplinary proceedings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Against Richard Mdluli.  Unless there 
is anything further that you wish me to address you on this I would like 
to ask … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 117 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no (intervenes). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This witness if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you can ask the witness.  I just wanted you to 
appreciate that I do not think it is necessary to take the witness 
through the judgment.  All that is important is that there is an 
identification of which findings or conclusions were made that are 
relevant and then the witness can fill in if there are gaps or give 
context.  That is all. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you - you can decide if there is anything you 
10 
want to ask him in relation to the judgments or otherwise you can move 
on. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Specifically 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
Vosloorus case which is the decision by Advocate Chauke to withdraw 
those criminal charges.  Is there anything that you wish to add to the 
context of the withdrawal of those charges against General Mdluli 
Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was in - I was privy to the 
first charge sheet the indictment that was handed to the - the accused - 
(clearing of throat) excuse me - before the matter was placed on the 
20 
High Court roll.  It was a substantive charge sheet relating to all the 
charges. 
Therefore the decision at the time in the High Court to 
withdraw the matter was not something that I was - I was informed prior 
to that and I think that Advocate Van Zyl - Zaais Van Zyl who was - who 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 118 of 233 
 
was the prosecutor in the matter he was only - he was only also 
informed of that - that decision. 
I do not exactly know when but the second decision after the 
SCA judgment was sent back to the DPP’s Office to - for them to decide 
which charges they are going to place back on the roll or which - to my 
knowledge and in terms of what Advocate Van Zyl told me the charge 
sheet contained exactly the same charges as the first charge sheet 
which included the murder charge as well as the attempt - attempted 
murder charge. 
Ultimately the DPP - Advocate Chauke decided not to 
10 
continue with the prosecution of the murder charge as well as the 
attempted murder charge.  That is as far as I can take it in terms of 
what I know about those two prosecutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that after the SCA judgment when he decided not 
to continue? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  In terms of 
those two - the first two charges relating to murder and attempted 
murder … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Although it was in the indictment 
20 
or the charge sheet that Advocate Van Zyl prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said those were charges where you - which you 
had been involved in investigating? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  I was 
involved in - in the Vosloorus murder case investigation. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 119 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did not Mr Chauke or somebody in his office 
consult you before they made the decision to - not to continue? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
I 
was 
consulted 
by 
Advocate Van Zyl who drew up the charge sheet and the - the final 
charge sheet did include the murder and attempted murder charges but 
when it was sent to Advocate Chauke for his final decision.  He 
withdrew the - he - he took the murder charge as well as the attempted 
murder charge from the charge sheet. 
That is why they were only charged with the other charges 
and not the murder and the attempted murder charge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever ask anybody in that office why - why the 
other charges were not pursued in the charge sheet? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  From what I have been informed 
Chair the charges were not pursued as Advocate Chauke thought there 
was not enough evidence to continue with those charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But these were charges where the High Court had 
thought that there was enough evidence and had made an order that 
they - they should be pursued.  Is it not?  It is just the Supreme Court 
of Appeal for whatever reasons it might have given did not want to deal 
with that. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  As far as I - as far as I know Chair 
the - the Supreme Court of Appeal did not want to be prescriptive - 
prescriptive in terms of the charges … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That needs to be reinstituted.  
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 120 of 233 
 
That is why it was sent back but in terms of that when Advocate Van Zyl 
dealt with the charge sheet the second time round.  He - the charge 
sheet read exactly the same because the facts were exactly the same 
and based on that that was given to Advocate Chauke and then a 
decision was made to with - to - to not include those two charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your side as the investigator you - you were 
satisfied that there was enough evidence to cover (intervenes) those? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair as the - as the investigator I 
was - I was satisfied because the whole - the incident took - it is a - it 
is a - it is various incidents that took place over a period of time.  A 
10 
period of six months to a year.  So they all followed into each other.  
So it is circumstantial evidence that follow into each other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And as I said the facts did not 
change from the first indictment to the second indictment and - and I 
am not talking about myself now.  As - if Advocate Van Zyl was an SC in 
- in his own right … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I think there is enough charges 
after going through the - the criminal case docket.  Then to me that is 
20 
rather illuminating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is - I mean of course different people could 
have different views about whether there is enough evidence in 
particular case and the DPP has the - you know - the power to decide 
what charges to include or not to include but from what I have been 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 121 of 233 
 
told it appears that the High Court had concluded that those charges 
should be pursued. 
It is just that the Supreme Court of Appeal thought that as I 
understand it because of separation of powers it should not go that far 
and leave it to the - to the DPP.  So if you have a situation where you 
say Advocate Van Zyl is - is senior counsel and so he thought there 
was enough and the High Court Judge thought there was enough and 
you thought there was enough and you thought it - there was enough as 
an investigator as well.  That - that is the - the background.  That is the 
context. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is the context in terms of 
what I am saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I do agree it is the prerogative of 
the DPP … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To make the decision as to what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Needs to be charged and so on, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then one question there was the 
- the meeting that was had between Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba and - and 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 122 of 233 
 
now I am taking you a little back now - but the meeting that was held 
between Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba and General Dramat at which the 
matters were “sufficiently resolved”. 
Outside of the letter that you sent to Advocate Ferreira 
following your knowledge of that meeting which then called to get 
clarity on the way forward have you had sight of any letter, document or 
correspondence by Advocate Jiba on her position in relation to the 
withdrawal of charges against Advocate - against General Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair during this investigation I 
have not seen any document signed by Advocate Jiba relating to the 
10 
specific issues. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Thank you.  We are now on 
page 53 of your affidavit where you are giving evidence to the Chair 
about your attempts to declassify documents that were important for 
your investigations and at the bottom of that page you were informed 
that on 12 March 2013 General Ngcobo wrote to General Dramat in 
response to a communication he received. 
Can we take you to Annexure 29 and in part - which is found 
at page 3-3-6?  You will recall that this was in response to a letter by 
General Dramat requesting assistance from General Ngcobo in relation 
20 
to the declassification of documents which was sent on 7 March 2013? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is the essence of the response 
of General - Major General Ngcobo in this letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it - it relates to a letter 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 123 of 233 
 
dated 7 March - of March 2013 by General Dramat and paragraph 2 
states the following: 
“Since the commencement of the investigation in 
this division by various task teams and the 
Directorate of Priority Crime Investigation.  This 
division has experienced a number of leakages of 
classified information to the media which has 
resulted 
in 
the 
exposure 
of 
intelligence 
- 
intelligence assets and operational methodology of 
the - of the division.  Therefore the office is 
10 
currently consulting the Office of the National 
Commissioner on - on the request.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you aware of any media 
leakages of classified information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
there 
were 
various 
documentation that were in the - in the media or within the media at the 
time.  Although my - my team with we - with whom I worked we went - 
we underwent at least two/three polygraph tests in respect of these 
leakages and we passed all of those polygraph tests. 
So that is - we - when I saw this I actually felt quite - I 
20 
thought it was quite unfair because I saw this as - again as a tactic not 
to - not to declassify the documentation because the leakages did not 
come from us. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what did you then do? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I - I have to go back to my 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 124 of 233 
 
statement to see. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact while you are there you might 
- might as well go to the next annexure which is Annexure KDR30.  It 
starts on page 3-3-9. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  This is - 
this is now on the respond of the - on the response of the letter by 
General Ngcobo. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who write - what is this document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I am writing this document 
to 
General 
- 
General Dramat 
in 
response 
to 
the 
letter 
of 
10 
General Ngcobo indicating that he cannot assist and that he needs to 
consult the Office of the National Commissioner. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this letter is dated the 22 n d of 
March 2013, is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And if we look to, rather what are 
the important features that you’ve highlighted – that you can highlight 
from this document, it’s quite a lengthy document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I would like to share 
paragraph three which states the following, 
20 
 
“Coupled with this request a further request was forwarded to 
 
the office of the National Commissioner to declassify certain 
 
documentation which is needed in the abovementioned criminal 
 
matters.  Having perused the letter from acting Divisional 
 
Commissioner Crime Intelligence and Protection Services 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 125 of 233 
 
 
Major Ngcobo I’m not certain exactly what he is alleging in 
 
respect of this investigation and then I go further in paragraph 
 
six, the documents received from Crime Intelligence are stored 
 
environment to which access is limited.  The only other 
 
persons allowed access to the classified documents were 
 
member from the office of the Auditor General and the office of 
 
the Inspector General of Intelligence and then I also state the 
 
following, it is however, important to note that one must keep 
 
in mind that when dealing with a criminal matter certain 
 
information will become public knowledge due to the nature of 
10 
 
our criminal justice system.   
 
Once the matter is before Court it is in the public domain and 
 
the media have access.  With this regard I was thinking I was 
 
referring specifically to the affidavits I have filed in obtaining 
 
certain seizure warrants.  Those documents can be uplifted 
 
from a Magistrate by an individual if so required, it becomes a 
 
public document and what is contained in there is normally a 
 
factual background as to why you want access to that specific 
 
premises and then in paragraph ten I state, the problem with 
 
such vague allegations as stated by Major General Ngcobo’s 
20 
 
letter is that it could be used to conceal the fact that certain 
 
members of Crime Intelligence do not want to assist due to 
 
their own agendas.   
 
Paragraph 13, I’ve stated on numerous occasions that we 
 
would like to conduct our investigation with the assistance of 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 126 of 233 
 
 
Crime Intelligence, I’ve submitted several written requests for 
 
documents that I need in the criminal matter.  I have yet to 
 
receive said documents, I have not made an issue out of this 
 
but it would seem that the cooperation that I seek to establish 
 
came to nothing.  Chair then in paragraph 14, what is of 
 
further concern is that this specific issue, cooperation of 
 
witnesses within Crime Intelligence was given as one of the 
 
reasons 
as 
to 
why 
Advocate 
Magwebe 
stopped 
the 
 
investigation into Silverton CAS155/7/11 this was done after 
 
consultation with Major General Lazarus at the beginning of 
10 
 
2012.  It is important to note that the majority of members I 
 
require worked with him under the relevant period under 
 
investigation so they would become witnesses in the matter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And at paragraph 16? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Paragraph 16 says, 
 
“I want to reiterate that we need the assistance of Crime 
 
Intelligence in this matter, I have always been in favour of 
 
keeping Crime Intelligence abreast of the situation, this would 
 
include their participation in the investigation to limit the 
 
exposure of methods and methodology.  Without their 
20 
 
assistance in this regard it is very difficult to ensure that 
 
assets and methodology are not compromised, they have been 
 
given the opportunity to be part of the investigation but have 
 
yet to participate”.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this was done [indistinct] 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 127 of 233 
 
information that you prepared to General Dramat? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you know what General Dramat 
did with this information note? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I’m not sure whether this 
specific information that was forwarded to the National Commissioners 
office but I do know that General Dramat, on various occasions told me 
he had meetings with General Phiyega and in respect of those meetings 
he said that she refused to assist and she was not going to assist him, 
at some stage it became – he was not even considering asking anymore 
10 
because he was – I don’t think he would admit it but he was intimidated 
and victimised by General Phiyega at the time that is when he told 
me…[intervenes]. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Sorry Judge may I? 
COMMISSIONER:   Please come through. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Thank you Judge for the 
opportunity, I want to lodge an objection in manner in which the witness 
is testifying about General Phiyega, he’s basing it on…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Objection…(intervenes]. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   He is basing it on hearsay 
20 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja what’s wrong with hearsay evidence? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Well to the extent that we do not 
have any evidence from General Dramat in this respect. 
COMMISSIONER:   The Commission is allowed to hear, hearsay 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 128 of 233 
 
evidence, that is not to say it’s got licence to take all kinds of hearsay 
evidence but there is a leeway compared to a Court of law for it to 
take…[intervenes]. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   That is correct Judge I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I had not even heard him what he was saying 
then you objected, I don’t know what it is that you had heard which I 
had not heard yet? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Judge he’s …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did he say that is objectionable? 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Judge he’s mentioning alleged 
10 
reports that he claims that he has received from General Drama, we 
have not seen any of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I haven’t heard what he says. 
UNIDENTIFIED 
MALE 
SPEAKER: 
 
 
Okay 
Judge 
I’ll 
reserve 
it…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may reserve your right and as I say I think he 
was halfway through a sentence and - I can’t assess unless I know 
exactly what he was going to say. 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER:   Judge maybe we’ll just complete it 
and then I will – I will reserve my right to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, thank you, yes were giving an answer and 
I had not heard the full answer. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair basically my answer is the 
following I requested in writing as well as verbally General Dramat to 
assist in facilitating this process of getting documents declassified.  He 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 129 of 233 
 
did that by having meetings with General Phiyega.  He came back to me 
and he report back to me and he said – not that he had to report back 
to me but he is a gentleman he will always tell you what is going on to 
the best of his ability, he told me that in his meetings with General 
Phiyega it is evident and clear to him that she was not going to assist 
him in getting the documentation that we required to be declassified, 
declassified and that is the extent I can take it – I can only take that 
far. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes did he indicate what basis General Phiyega 
provided for being unwilling to provide the declassification? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he didn’t share her reasons 
with me but he was very despondent and I could see that he 
felt…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He felt intimidated. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes and he would not be – and he 
thought this was not going to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did you approach any senior State 
Advocate to also assist in the declassification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I also approached the – 
20 
well I didn’t approach this, he was appointed as part of the prosecution 
to now deal with the criminal matter and on the 6 t h of August 2013 the 
Senior State Advocate Rita Viljoen who was a prosecutor in the criminal 
matter that included all the allegations…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry are you back to the statement? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 130 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair but you know, with your 
leave we could perhaps just go to the actual document itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes what page is that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   On page 344. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is that the document you referred 
to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What’s the purpose of this 
document? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the purpose of this 
document was to get documents declassified and to get Viljoen who 
wrote this letter under the letterhead of the Special Commercial Crimes 
Unit of which she is part, it is dated 6 t h of August 2013 and it hand 
delivered to Major General Ngcobo office.  You’ll see that we ask for 
the following members to assist us and we clarify or she clarifies that 
the members need not stress as they were regarded not as suspects or 
possible suspects, they were regarded as witnesses and then 
declassification of documents.  then there’s a list on the next page, she 
states the following regarding them, 
20 
 
“The documents mentioned below will be relied upon as 
 
evidence in this matter.  It is therefore essential that said 
 
documents be declassified for the use thereof in a Court of 
 
law”, 
 
And then she lists various documents that needs to be 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 131 of 233 
 
declassified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Is it therefore correct that from this 
document in itself it becomes very apparent as to which members you 
need to consult and what the list of documents are that you – what the 
list of documents is that you require? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair this is not 
an exhaustive list there were additions to this and this was also 
forwarded at a later stage to various people in authority. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that following that, you 
wrote another information note, dated the 17 t h of October 2013? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I ask you to look at Annexure 
32 which starts at page 347. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is this the document that you 
authored? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can ask you to turn to page 
348…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on that document is at 347? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It’s 347 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some of the pages are not marked here, was there a 
response to the letter from Viljoen? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I cannot – there wasn’t a 
response Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 132 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no response? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Not from General Ngcobo, no 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that letter from Advocate Viljoen, that’s letter 
from the NPA isn’t it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – and if there had been a response you expected 
to have been copied or to have been told about it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I would have expected 
to, I have not received any document, Advocate Viljoen has not given 
10 
me any document relating to a response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay right you may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The document that then appears – 
that starts on page 347 which is Annexure 32 to your affidavit and 
dated 17 October 2013, can I ask you to turn to page 348 of this bundle 
and please read into the record paragraphs, 4, 5, 6 and 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s identify the document first, it’s a letter from 
whom to whom dealing with what subject and then we can look at a 
particular paragraph. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair, this is a 
20 
document which has been authored by Colonel Roelofse and it’s been 
addressed to the head of the Anti Corruption Task Team, Brigadier K 
Moodley and also to Deputy National Commissioner Lieutenant General 
Dramat dated 17 October 2013 under subject title, investigations 
Lyttelton CAS no 432/11/2011 fraud and/or theft and/or corruption and 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 133 of 233 
 
Silverton CAS no 155/07/2011 fraud and/or theft and/or corruption 
Divisional Commissioner Mdluli and others and this is then a note that 
you draft, if I can ask you to turn your attention to paragraph 4 of your 
note please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair I just need to mention 
that this note is in the back of a meeting that happened on the 17 t h, on 
the same day with General Dramat and based on that I drafted this 
note, paragraph 4, 
 
“I approached Major General Ngcobo just after his appointment 
 
as acting head of Criminal and Crime Intelligence with the view 
10 
 
to secure his cooperation in this investigation.  My first 
 
correspondence was via email dated 2012/07/05 I did not  
 
receive any response to this email and subsequently request 
 
to meet with Major General Ngcobo were also unsuccessful. I 
 
then forwarded a SMS to him in late September 2012 which 
 
then resulted in a meeting dated 2012/10/02.  During the 
 
meeting that took place, he assured me that he will assist and 
 
appointed Brigadier Nxosana as a liaison officer.  I was asked 
 
to put my request in writing and assured prompt cooperation.  I 
 
duly complied and forwarded various requests to Brigadier 
20 
 
Nxosana.  These requests pre-dated the appointment of Major 
 
General Ngcobo and were merely repeated this has also been 
 
ignored.  On 2013/02/13 I again tried to secure his 
 
cooperation, the cooperation of Crime Intelligence by means of 
 
a letter in which I requested the assistance and making 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 134 of 233 
 
 
available members in an attempt to obtain witness statements 
 
from them.  Paragraph 6, this request was ignored and this has 
 
led me to request your assistance in this matter.  In this regard 
 
I requested your office to facilitate a written request addressed 
 
to Major Ngcobo.  This was done on 2013/03/07”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Please continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “The response from  Major 
 
General Ngcobo dated 2013/03/12 indicated that he will not 
 
make members available, he indicated that he has escalated 
 
the request to the office of the National Commissioner and that 
10 
 
he is currently in consultation with said office”. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then paragraph 9, is it correct 
that you had then requested General Dramat to facilitate a meeting 
between yourself and Major General Ngcobo? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And this meeting took place on the 
24 t h of July 2013 at your office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What happened at this meeting? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “I then requested that you 
20 
 
facilitate the meeting, in this regard I’m talking about General 
 
Dramat now between Major General Ngcobo, you and I, this 
 
meeting took place on 24 July 2013 at your office.  During this 
 
meeting General Ngcobo indicated that he is finding it difficult 
 
to fulfil his mandate as he received requests from this office to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 135 of 233 
 
 
assist with the investigation and then receives communication 
 
from Lieutenant General Mdluli and Major General Lazarus 
 
urging him not to investigate in the investigation.  Major 
 
General Ngcobo was informed by me that I cannot secure his 
 
cooperation - that if I cannot secure his cooperation I have but 
 
two option open to me to pursue.  This would entail 
 
approaching Judge Musha in terms of his appointment to 
 
investigate matters relating to DPCI investigations and/or seek 
 
a subpoena via the Courts to secure cooperation from 
 
members”. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And at paragraph 12 lastly. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   “At this point I can categorically 
state that I have not received any cooperation from Crime Intelligence 
since the re-employment of Major General Henkel late in 2011”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In paragraph 9 you say that Major General Ngcobo 
told you and General Dramat in the meeting that he was finding it 
difficult to fulfil his mandate because of requests that he was receiving 
from the Hawks to assist with the investigation and then said – you say 
he said he received communications from Lieutenant General Mdluli 
and Major General Lazarus urging him not to assist with the 
20 
investigation.  Did Major General Ngcobo say what the basis was for 
General Mdluli and General Lazarus to say to him he should not assist, 
did he indicate what the basis was for them to ask him not to assist? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he did not directly indicate 
what the basis were he actually didn’t give any reason he just stated 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 136 of 233 
 
that and he left it at that.  So I do not know exactly what happened 
between him and General Lazarus and General Mdluli as to why he 
would say something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they had no authority over him, did they? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair they didn’t have any 
authority over him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he had no obligation to obey whatever they may 
have requested him to do or not to do? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair he didn’t have any 
obligation to obey. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   When General – or rather General 
Zulu, as I understand it replaced General Ngcobo when he was 
suspended is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Back to page 54 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have any knowledge of whether Major 
General Ngcobo’s suspension had anything to do with how he was 
handling the investigations there where he was asked to assist? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I do not know, I do not 
20 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   At paragraph 178.7, following 
the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you back to the statement? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 137 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must announce so otherwise we don’t know 
which – we don’t know that you are back to the statement, paragraph. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Page 54 paragraph 178.7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   When General Zulu came into office 
were any steps taken to approach General Zulu…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember just to let the witness give evidence, 
don’t lead him on some of these things, let the evidence come from 
him. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   As it pleases Chair.  Did Dramat 
take any additional steps during February or March 2015 after General 
Ngcobo left office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair during February and March 
2014 General Dramat requested, in writing a meeting with Lieutenant 
General Bongi Zulu…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go further, you haven’t told me how the 
meeting between yourself, General Dramat and Major General Ngcobo 
ended, what was the outcome of that meeting.  You have said that he 
said he was finding it difficult to fulfil his mandate but tell me how the 
20 
meeting ended. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair the meeting ended without 
a decision being taken, General Ngcobo didn’t agree to assist us with 
the investigation or myself with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well are you able to share with me more in terms of 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 138 of 233 
 
the content of that discussion at that meeting other than just what is in 
the statement. I would have thought that the discussion would have 
been 
quite 
detailed 
because 
this 
was 
a 
very 
important 
of 
declassification you had experienced lots of resistance or lack of 
cooperation and at least, ultimately, you had a meeting with somebody 
now and that I would imagine that he wouldn’t just get away with saying 
because of you people making lots of request to me I find it difficult to 
do my job.  I mean what kind of response is that, I would imagine you 
wouldn’t allow that to go unchallenged? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I wasn’t – I tried to keep 
10 
the emotion out of the documents so yes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no keep the emotions out but reason with the 
man, he’s telling you, you people are making too many requests and he 
says, that’s the reason why he’s no cooperating so what kind of 
response is that you people – I would have expected you to say, hang 
on if we need your assistance, we need your assistance, you must 
assist us where must we go, you have the information, if you don’t have 
proper reasons not declassify, classify.  If you’ve got reasons why tell 
us why? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair you’re quite correct, the 
20 
meeting wasn’t just ten minutes it was quite a lengthy meeting and a lot 
of things was discussed during the meeting.  A lot of the things were 
said to us in confidence by General Ngcobo that he felt that he could 
not assist us he did not only get pressure from General Mdluli and 
General Lazarus, he also referred to senior management, his own 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 139 of 233 
 
management that does not want to assist him or doesn’t want to allow 
him to assist us.  He was, during the meeting he was very apologetic in 
terms of the position that he is in but he still said under the 
circumstances he would not be able to assist us.  So we tried to 
impress on him the seriousness and why we need it and I remember 
specifically the first time I met him I gave him a full briefing as stated 
in this affidavit regarding the allegations and he agreed that it was very 
serious allegations and there was an agreement that he would assist 
initially but just nothing happened after that and I think during that 
meeting it came to light that he was getting pressure but not only for – 
10 
he was only willing to name the name of General Mdluli and General 
Lazarus but he referred to management that is not assisting him.  So 
that, in essence, it took a long time to have the discussion but that, in 
essence is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you come out of the meeting with a very clear 
view that were it not for pressure from other people he would be giving 
you the documents or were you not sure? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I formed that view when I 
initially informed him of the allegations, I had the view then but 
because of the time lapse and what had happened up to then and his 
20 
non-assistance up to that point I was not convinced that he would be 
able, even if he wanted to I don’t think he would have helped us in any 
event.  So therefore I regarded that meeting as rather futile, the 
outcome of the meeting in any event. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your view, based on the discussion at the meeting 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 140 of 233 
 
and what had gone on before that, your view was well there may be 
pressure but even if there was no pressure he would not give us the 
documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think without any pressure 
from anyone, and he was allowed to do his job he would have – we 
would have been able to accommodate each other because as I said 
during our meetings I always maintained the position that I didn’t want 
to place any agent, any project in jeopardy and if we are going to 
declassify documents it would be with – it would be with agreement 
between the different parties, the NPA, the investigators as well as 
10 
Crime Intelligence.  So that was always my standpoint and how I 
approached this.  That’s why I say when I first walked out of the 
meeting after I briefed him and he understood the seriousness of the 
allegation I was under the impression we will be able to get somewhere 
but when he didn’t correspond to us, when he didn’t come back to us, 
even with the person that he appointed as a liaison officer, to whom I 
gave various documents requesting further documents and requesting 
documents to be declassified and nothing – and we were not contacted 
again.  So at that point in time I was quite certain it is not going to 
happen, he is not going to assist us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now from what you have said it would appear that he 
may have told you at the meeting or some of the things that he may 
have told you in confidence may if revealed show that there were 
certain people who may have put pressure on him when there were no 
legitimate grounds for saying documents should not be disclosed to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 141 of 233 
 
you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair that is the sense that I got. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He was not - he was not giving … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was not giving too much information? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja.  He did not take us into his 
confidence as to who these individuals were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But he did allude to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was - it reminded me of 
General Mkhwanazi in Parliament saying there is powers from above 
that tells me what to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Just repeat that. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Mkhwanazi when he was 
the Acting Commissioner of Police he gave that response in Parliament 
saying that he receives orders from above. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So that is the sense that I got 
when I walked out of that meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So he is not acting as his own man 
in terms … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Of the position that he is holding. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 142 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I know that Ms September did announce that the 
investigators have been - have been able to be in touch with 
Major-General Ngcobo now and probably he would come and give 
evidence about among other things why he did not give cooperation and 
hopefully will be able to tell me if there were people above him who put 
pressure on him not to do what he felt was - needed to be done in 
terms of the work. 
In other words if there are people who without any legitimate 
reason said he must not declassify documents that should have been 
declassified for purposes of your investigation so - so - but I think he - 
10 
I think he will come at some stage and he - he can then give me 
information.  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Going back to any 
further steps that General Dramat took when General Ngcobo left 
office. 
 
Are 
you 
aware 
of 
any 
further 
steps 
taken 
during 
February/March 2014? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  I am aware.  I again on 
request from myself General Dramat in writing requested a meeting with 
20 
General Bongi Zulu.  She (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
General Zulu 
replaced 
General 
- 
Major-General Ngcobo during the latter’s suspension? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  As far as I 
know … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 143 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He - she replaced him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And the letter was in an effort to 
resolve the declassification of documentation that we had in our 
possession as well as the non-cooperation of Crime Intelligence 
members.  I - I do see that I state that General Zulu replaced 
General Ngcobo when he was suspended. 
I do not know whether this meeting took place with 
General Dramat but on 9 March 2014 General Dramat sent the following 
10 
to General Zulu via two separate emails. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then take you to those 
documents that you are about to refer to?  The first document is 
Annexure KDR33 and it begins at page 3-5-1. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This appears to be an email sent 
from DPCI Head on 9 March 2014 03:16 pm and it is sent to the 
Divisional Commissioner of Crime Intelligence CC Zulu, Bongiwe 
Major-General subject being request for declassification of documents 
and assistance with witness statements.  Silverton CAS 155/07/2011. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The email which is really just a 
covering email attaches a request for assistance? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And could you then turn the page to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 144 of 233 
 
page 3-5-2. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That appears to be the letter that 
was in fact authored by or signed rather by General Dramat? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Once again this is another enclosing 
letter to the document which follows at page 3-5-3.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this is the very same document 
that you read into the record earlier which was dated 6 August 2013 
10 
calling for consultation with specific individuals and providing a list of 
the declassification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  It is again 
the same request from Advocate Viljoen. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then go to the next 
annexure - KDR 34 and that starts on page 3-5-5 with the same sender 
to the same recipient and the same subject title.  What is the date of 
this email Mr Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  9 March 2014 03:18 pm addressed 
- and it is from the DPCI Head which is General Dramat addressed to 
20 
Major-General Bongi - Bongiwe Zulu. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if one actually looks to the two 
annexures the one - the two emails - enclosing emails on page 3-5-1 
and 3-5-5.  So keep the - the page open at 3-5-5 please … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 145 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And turn to page 3-5-1. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It appears that the only difference in 
these two emails is the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair and the 
attachment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that appears to be two minutes 
apart? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  So it was the same email that 
10 
was sent two minutes apart? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  They only 
different attachments. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did - excuse me? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It had different attachments. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How so were the attachments 
different? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I am not mistaken the first 
- the first email dealt with the letter from Advocate Viljoen … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And the second email dealt with 
additional witnesses that need to be interviewed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and that is then reflected on 
page 3-5-6.  Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 146 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did General Zulu respond to these 
communications/ 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair she did not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you take any steps after 
receiving no response from Crime Intelligence to this date? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Chair 
I 
again 
asked 
General Dramat to assist and to resend … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We are on page 3-55. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And to resend the same request.  
In September 2014 after receiving no response - this is now five 
10 
months more than five months - I consulted with General Dramat.  
Informing him that I have completed a draft affidavit in which I sought 
to obtain a subpoena in terms of Section 205 of the Criminal Procedure 
Act in order to ensure the cooperation of Crime Intelligence. 
General Dramat provided me with the above correspondence 
which his office has forwarded to Crime Intelligence in an attempt to 
secure their assistance.  He requested me to allow him one last chance 
to secure the cooperation of the various role players and then on 
23 September 2014 General Dramat again forwarded his letter dated 
7 March 2014 to General Zulu. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then take you to page 3-5-9 
please?  Is this the email that you were referring to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For the record this email is sent from 
DPCI Head sent on 23 September 2014 at 04:12 pm addressed to Zulu, 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 147 of 233 
 
Bongiwe 
Major-General and 
CC 
Divisional 
Commissioner 
Crime 
Intelligence.  The subject is to request for assistance in securing 
availability of members and the request to declassify of documents and 
assistance with witness statements and it appears from at least this 
covering email that certain attachments were attached although there 
does not appear to be more than one page attached to this.  Is that 
right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could ask you then to read the 
second and the third paragraphs into the record please? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Page 360? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  359. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  359.  Sorry.  I just want to … 
“The investigation into the allegations regarding the 
applicable 
documents 
has 
being 
completed.  
However the aspect - the aspect of obtaining - 
obtaining of affidavits relating to the chain evidence 
by members is delaying the finalisation of the 
investigation.  Due to new evidence and additional 
charges in the case - in the cases herewith a list of 
20 
requested documents to be declassified.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when one turns the page there is 
an image of a letter? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please clarify what this 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 148 of 233 
 
particular document is relative to the enclosing email? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it is exactly the same letter 
that was sent - that was sent on 3 March - 2 March 2014 enclosing 
Advocate Viljoen’s letter. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So that then happened 
on 23 September 2014? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What happened subsequent to that 
and we are back now on page 55 of your affidavit? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “In the - (clearing of 
10 
throat) - in the middle of October 2014 I contained 
Brigadier Van Graan.  He is attached or he is - he is 
the - he is requesting assistance as a legal advisor 
to both the DPCI and Crime Intelligence.  At that 
point I still not received any feedback.  I explained 
to him that the seriousness of the situation and I 
provided him a copy of my draft affidavit as 
mentioned above.  He indicated that he would try 
and 
facilitate 
the 
process 
as 
to 
avoid 
embarrassment to all parties concerned.  On 
20 
30 October I was informed through the Office of 
General Dramat that General Zulu had indicated in 
writing that - that DPCI does not need to request 
permission to conduct a criminal investigation.  She 
did 
not 
address 
the 
request 
about 
the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 149 of 233 
 
declassification of documentation.” 
See Annexure 36. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to that end can I take you to 
page 3-6-2 which is Annexure 36? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This letter appears to be dated 
30 October 2014? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it is a letter that has been 
authored by Major-General Zulu to the attention of the Head - the 
10 
National 
Head 
Directorate 
for 
Priority 
Crime 
Investigation 
Brigadier Moodley.  Please read the second paragraph into the record. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it states the following: 
“Please take note that it is not necessary for you to 
request permission to this office to conduct your 
criminal investigation in these matters.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And paragraph 3. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
“During 
your 
investigation you must however guard against the 
unauthorised disclosure of classified information.” 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how did this particular letter 
impact on the level of cooperation you then received? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I had to provide this letter to 
the members of CI which I had to interview because they were not 
willing to discuss anything with me without specific authorisation by the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 150 of 233 
 
Head of Crime Intelligence or the Acting Head at - at that time.  It is 
stating the obvious in terms of paragraph 2 that I do not need - that I 
do not - it is not necessary for me to request permission. 
That is true.  However in respect of Crime Intelligence the 
members were not willing to assist because of the previous 
victimisation that they experienced and they wanted in writing 
confirmation that they can talk to me and that is the basis of this letter.  
However this letter does not address the - the question of the 
declassification. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But it certainly opened up the door to 
10 
your consulting and engaging with the members? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  In terms of 
the members that I requested to speak to it did. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We go back to page 55 of your 
affidavit.  At paragraph 185 you talk about further engagements that 
you have during January 2015. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please elaborate. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair since receiving the letter in 
October from - from General Zulu.  In January 2015 I again contacted 
20 
Brigadier Van Graan requesting his assistance.  He informed me that he 
no longer acted as a legal advisor to the DPCI at that stage and CI but 
still - but was still willing to facilitate the - the declassification of the 
documentation that I needed. 
He then set up a meeting with - on 23 January 2015 with 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 151 of 233 
 
Brigadier Adolph - Magezi Adolph Ntuli from Crime Intelligence and 
Brigadier Van Graan in Pretoria.  At that point in time the Supreme 
Court of Appeal judgment delivered on 17 April 2014 confirmed the 
setting aside of Advocate Mrwebi’s decision not to withdraw - to 
withdraw the matter and - and the fraud and corruption charges. 
I explained to Brigadier Ntuli that I need the documentation to 
be declassified as the matter has to be re-enrolled and I gave 
Brigadier Ntuli a copy of my letter dated the 20 t h - 23 January 2015 
explaining the reason for the declassification request and for additional 
documents to be declassified. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can we then turn to page - to 
Annexure KDR37 which starts on page 3-6-4?  Is the letter that you 
authored to Brigadier Ntuli dated 23 January 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this is the document that you 
referred to now briefly in your evidence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 3-6-5 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What was the Brigadier Ntuli’s position? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Brigadier Ntuli was - I think he 
was the Head of Counter Intelligence within Crime Intelligence.  In 
other words a unit within Crime Intelligence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 3-6-5 at paragraph 6 you 
outline the assistance that is required.  Can you please read paragraph 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 152 of 233 
 
6 into the record? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  “However prior to such 
an application this office would appreciate your 
assistance in determining - determining the impact - 
the declassification of said document would have if 
any.  The documentation in question relates to the 
acquisition of two vehicles in 2010 and the 
subsequent claim that accompanied those vehicles.  
The second set of documents relates to travel 
claims submitted to the Secret Service Account by 
10 
certain members from Crime Intelligence.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then at paragraph 8 you mention 
an - the additional type of assistance required. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is - that is true Chair. 
“Secondly in terms of access to witnesses within 
Crime Intelligence this office would like to interview 
the following members namely Brigadier Steyn, 
Lieutenant-Colonel M Nel and L Prinsloo.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And from - at paragraph 9 you talk - 
you basically put the request into context of the criminal charges that 
20 
were looming? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And at paragraph 11 you once again 
inform of what access is required? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 153 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In particular you list at paragraph 11 
applications to CI in terms of which the individuals were appointed if 
any - job application.  Interviews prior to appointment held with the 
individuals that were appointed if any.  Appointment letters - any other 
information relating to the appointment of the above mentioned 
individuals not mentioned. 
Some of those names being redacted Chair.  Is it correct that 
this information or rather to which investigation would this information 
relate? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair if I can take you back to the 
10 
- if I can make it easy if I can refer to diagram two I think.  It would be 
the ones that relate to be placed back on the roll.  (Intervenes). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can - maybe to assist you then can 
we look at KK2.3 the diagrams bundle and it maybe that you are looking 
for diagram five? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It maybe Chair.  I am confused at 
this point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say it related to the charges that had been 
withdrawn? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In other words the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The murder - the Vosloorus? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Vosloorus … 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 154 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Matter. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No it does not - does not relate to 
the Vosloorus matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It relates now to the - the looting 
of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The car and the … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The car and the trip? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  If we go back then to page 56 
of your affidavit.  What happened during early February 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I was informed and I cannot 
remember 
whether 
it 
was 
General 
- 
General Dramat 
or 
Brigadier Van Graan that my request will not be attended to.  Crime 
Intelligence wanted to know how and why I gained access to the 
classified documentation. 
This response from Crime Intelligence was not expected 
20 
because during September 2011 DPCI and - and CI agreed on the 
handing over of documents required for the CI criminal investigation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What did you then do? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I then contacted Brigadier Ntuli … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that.  The request that they were saying would 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 155 of 233 
 
not be attended to was that the request for declassification of certain 
documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the reason given to you for the decision 
that the request would not be attended to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair there was not a - no reason 
was given to me other than a question which I consider as the shifting 
of the goal post.  A question was - was asked to me or asked of me as 
to how I got - how I got into possession of these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that relates to the documents which you had … 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But needed to be declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but did you ask them what is the reason? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I did not ask the reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you had reached a point where asking was not - 
you realised asking was not going to really give you any …? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was not going to assist me Chair 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because at this point in time I am 
now being questioned as to why I have the documentation in my 
possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this is now in 2015 - February 2015.  You had 
started trying to get documents declassified - declassified from when? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 156 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  2012 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From 2012.  So something like more or less three 
years had lapsed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are not getting assistance. You are still 
where you were in 20212? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of these documents. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But now I am being - now I am 
being asked as how I - how I got hold of the document … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And I mean this is still the 
institution Crime Intelligence.  There must be record.  They must know 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
How 
I 
got 
hold 
of 
the 
documentation because that was all dealt with in 2011 already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  So the - the reference to a meeting - an 
agreement in 2011 to which you refer in paragraph 1-8-7 of your 
statement did that relate to - did that also relate to classified 
20 
documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there had been an agreement before? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair by the heads 
of those departments. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 157 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and at that time who was the Head of Crime 
Intelligence?  Was it (indistinct)? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No Chair. The - the Acting Head 
was General Muchachi (?). 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At that time and his - and his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deputy? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
Direct 
superior 
was 
General Lebeya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  As Head of Detectives.  My … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they had agreed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  My head was General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Those had agreed? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Those had agreed.  They were the 
- they were in charge of those institutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So the failure to comply or honour that 
undertaking happened when there were other people occupying those 
positions? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In regard to the Head of Crime Intelligence the - 
the - whilst the Head was General Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He was suspended at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was suspended at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes.  He was already suspended 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 158 of 233 
 
at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But whoever was put in to … 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To replace him temporarily during his suspension also 
did not agree to have the documents handed over? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair.  You will 
remember that General Ngcobo used the - or stated that documents 
were leaked so he cannot assist us.  He was going to approach the 
Office of the - of the National Commissioner to get clarity.  He also said 
that then Mdluli - General Mdluli and General Lazarus interfered and he 
10 
also said that he cannot assist us because of - he is not in a position to 
fulfil his mandate as there are people telling him what to do and what 
not to do. 
That was the - that is what was raised by General Ngcobo.  
Now this is a new one.  This is now why do I have the documentation in 
my possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the one who was saying this to you, you said 
was Brigadier Zulu?  Who was saying your request will not be attended 
to?  Who was that?  Who said that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair I - if I am not mistaken I - I 
20 
cannot 
specifically 
remember 
but 
it 
would 
have 
been 
either 
General Dramat or Brigadier Van Graan if I can remember correctly but 
it would have been a remark made to me.  It would not have been in - in 
writing or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and you were getting a report from somebody else 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 159 of 233 
 
not that somebody from Crime Intelligence was saying this to you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but throughout this time three years you 
have been trying to get these documents declassified.  Is the position 
that every one of those people from Crime Intelligence who - would 
could have given the approval could have approved that you be given 
the documents.  Every one of them knew that you wanted the 
documents as part of an investigation relating to General Mdluli? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair.  All of them knew and 
… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I - and I specifically briefed 
General Ngcobo.  So he knew the extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE: 
 
I 
did 
not 
specifically 
brief 
General Zulu regarding the extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I had a meeting with her but I did 
not specifically brief her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because I was under the 
impression she would at that point and time when I spoke to her that 
she would know the seriousness of the allegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, I did not receive any 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 160 of 233 
 
documentation and the reason why I was approaching crime intelligence 
for this was not necessarily; was to get the documents declassified but 
with their assistance. Because ultimately the decision to declassify lies 
with the national Commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. So, the approach to crime intelligence was 
not to get declassification because declassification can only be 
obtained from the national Commissioner? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Or yes, Chair or if she delegates 
someone to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what you wanted from crime intelligence was 
10 
for them to hand the documents over to you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair I had the documents 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but remember you said I think there are some 
that you had which needed to be declassified but there were some that 
you did not have which you need it as well. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes, Chair it is twofold. It is the 
ones that I had I need assistance in declassification and the ones I 
don’t have a need declassified format. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I just want to make sure I understand. You 
20 
have made a remark which I understood to mean because only the 
national Commissioner could declassify or somebody delegated by him 
to do so. Your approach to crime intelligence wasn’t aimed at getting 
the documents declassified but it was aimed at getting them to agree to 
hand over the documents to you. Is my understanding correct?

MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair it is not completely 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what is the correct position? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The position is the following. I 
approach them to get additional documentation. And in respect of the 
declassification I approach them because I wanted their assistance so 
that we can because I knew when the documentation would go to the 
national Commissioner, he or she would say that because that would be 
the prudent way to deal with this matter. That the National Prosecuting 
Authority, the Prosecutor, crime intelligence as well as the investigator 
10 
get together and decide on the documentation as to what can be 
classified, no it cannot be classified. And that is to mitigate the risk of 
exposing projects or agents. So, I had… That is the reason why I 
opposed them to do exactly what I expected the national Commissioner 
will do to get the documents declassified. In that sense, I did not get 
any joy from them. I was not assisted in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let me try again. Did you want crime intelligence 
officials to in effect facilitate the declassification of the documents by 
the national Commissioner? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted their cooperation to achieve that object? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what were they to do that would give you that 
cooperation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, they would have… I 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 162 of 233 
 
requested from them that we sit together with the documentation in 
question to make sure that when we declassify the documents that that 
specific document would not have an impact on an agent or the project. 
In other words, would not negatively affect those projects or the agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And if there is risk involved then 
we can see how we can mitigate that specific risk. For instance, if it is 
an agent this document is very important then it will allow crime 
intelligence to withdraw the agent from whatever he is doing. And allow 
us then to use the documents after he was withdrawn. At least that kind 
10 
of thing that I was looking at when speaking to crime intelligence 
because they are the only ones that can assist me with that situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would they have from what you are saying it 
seems to me that you wanted to see the classified documents before 
they are declassified. Is it right? That’s what would happen if you sat 
down with them. They would need to bring the documents. You would all 
look at them and try and agree certain things. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, once again it’s twofold. I 
had certain documentation which I received from General Hankel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, I was talking about the ones in 
my possession and I was also talking, referring to the ones that they 
had in their possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In other words, when the ones that 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 163 of 233 
 
they had in their possession if there is an agreement then they would 
release them to me already declassified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. So, as far as those documents that they had 
which you didn’t have whatever cooperation you needed from them did 
not entail you seeing the documents before they were declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, it would have entailed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have entailed that. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because it might be that the 
document does not have any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Relevance. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Relevance. So, it would have 
entailed that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now, how does this work in terms of classified 
documents? Would somebody in your position as part of the Hawks part 
of the SAPS, would they be entitled to see those documents before they 
were declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. If you have the 
requisite clearance you are allowed to see them yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, which you did have? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they knew that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  They issued the clearance 
certificate for me. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 164 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They issued the clearance. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, signed by General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so before the national Commissioner would be 
approached to declassify, you wanted to sit down with crime 
intelligence, look at the documents and identify the ones that would be 
relevant or important for investigation. And then jointly see whether 
there would be any problem if they were declassified. And if there was 
agreement 
that 
they 
can 
be 
declassified 
then 
the 
national 
Commissioner would be approached on the understanding that crime 
intelligence has no problem with declassification of those documents. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. If I can just 
mention. That is the approach that General Phahlane took when he was 
requested by the NPA. So, that’s why I knew that was going to be the 
approach. That’s why I approached crime intelligence for exactly that 
purpose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And throughout this period from 2012 to 2015 
February when you were told that your request would not be attended 
to. Had nobody from crime intelligence ever advanced any reason why 
these documents should not be made available to you or why they 
should not be declassified or what the justification was for classifying 
20 
them in the first place? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I have never in writing 
received any communication as to why the documents cannot be 
declassified apart from explaining numerous occasions why I did not 
steal the documentation. Because that is the only thing that they were 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 165 of 233 
 
interested in. How did I get hold of the documents and I was… And this 
thing was kept over my head for a long time and still is. That they will 
open up a criminal case against me because I stole the documents. 
Although, I don’t give much credence to that but we’ve got strange 
times so things can happen but it is something that was canvassed at 
that stage. Already it was canvassed in the Supreme Court of Appeal. It 
was… Everybody knew the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, it was very strange to me that 
that would still be an issue at that time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having gone through the situation for over, for about 
three years or so 2012 to February 2015 and seen the lack of 
cooperation/resistance to you being given these documents or to the 
declassification of the documents. Were you able to reach some 
conclusion as to why it was there was no cooperation for you to get 
these documents or get them declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, as I said from the 
investigations that I have done as together with the information 
provided by Colonel Naidoo, it became clear to me that it is not. The 
investigation did not only include General Mdluli and General Lazarus 
20 
but it went much wider than that and it included very senior people not 
necessarily also inside the police but outside the police. And I think 
that is what, I cannot say it is a fact but that is what I suspect as to 
what happened and that is why this has happened in this manner. There 
is, I cannot see that General Mdluli is or that people will just risk their 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 166 of 233 
 
careers just for General Mdluli except if he has something on them that 
we don’t know about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but your conclusion was that this kind of 
resistance or lack of cooperation must be connected with the possibility 
that this investigation would affect probably other people other than 
General Mdluli. And some of those people being people outside of 
crime intelligence. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. I previously 
already testified regarding Mr Cecil Burdges who is a member of 
Parliament. There was a direct interference by him. These are the kind 
10 
of things that will come out during this investigation and I don’t think 
that would have been… That is one of the reasons why this. I’m not 
referring to that specifically now but it is examples like that as to what 
this investigation were not allowed to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just in clarity on the one point 
relating to the crime intelligence input. To what extent is the input of 
crime intelligence a requirement in order for the documents, classified 
documents to be declassified? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, it’s a difficult question to 
20 
answer. I do not think that it is a requirement but I think it will also be 
very reckless if the national Commissioner does not take, does not get 
advice from them in terms of what can or what cannot be declassified. 
Because of the fact that they can impact on projects and agents. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. So… [intervenes]. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 167 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, oh okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just. The documents that you had with you in 
respect of which you also needed declassification, you had looked at 
them. They had been in your position for quite some time. Was there 
anything in them in terms of the contents that you thought could affect 
State security? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In my view, no Chair. It related to 
the acquisition of assets. It is a supply-chain management issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, it did not relate to a specific 
project or a specific agent. The only agents or so-called agent that was 
affected by is this where the family and friends of those, of the three 
individuals that were appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Which I investigated. So, in terms 
of the rest deal with them. I kept away from that specifically 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So, did you form any view based on the contents 
of the documents that you had with you which still needed 
declassification? Did you form any view as to whether there would have 
20 
been any proper grounds for them to have been classified in the first 
place? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, that is where I think the 
over classification took place which is unnecessary. When it relates to 
payment of an agent or something in terms of a project then 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 168 of 233 
 
declassification is normally secret or top-secret. But these claims did 
not specifically relate to an individual or a project. It was generic, the 
applications. The vehicle for, if I can remember correctly the motivation 
for the vehicle for a General Mdluli it just states it is a vehicle that is 
need for his office. There is nothing sensitive about it apart from the 
fact that you don’t want the vehicle registration number, you don’t want 
it to be known. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But General Mdluli is a public 
figure. So, he would have been in respect of that he would have been 
10 
his own worst enemy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because he would drive with a 
crime intelligence vehicle who might or might not be registered in his 
name or in a company’s name which would then lead to that in itself is 
already a security risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, based on what you know namely in terms of the 
contents of the documents that you have required classification, are 
you able to say whether the refusal to cooperate has no legitimate 
grounds? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m saying that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are saying that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this an abuse of power? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. It is abuse 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 169 of 233 
 
of power. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you received information 
during February 2015, the crime intelligence that you request will not 
be attended to, what do you do about it? Did it stop you or did you 
proceed to take further steps? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair it didn’t stop me. I tried 
again. As I said, I contacted Brigadier Chili. He was the legal officer of 
CI for assistance. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry, just for the record it’s 
10 
Brigadier Dennis Chili. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that would be Chili. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chili. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the correct pronunciation would be Chili. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies for that to Chili. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chili. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It looks like a Chili. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are able to say Cele. Isn’t it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, I’m able to say that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, if you are able to say Cele there’s a good chance 
you can say Chili as well. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chili. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chili. If you practice it a few times you will get it 
right. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 170 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I will get that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right. Yes, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, he indicates to me that he 
didn’t foresee any problem and but I had to transmit my request by the 
office of the acting national head of DPCI where at that time was 
General Mathandazo Benny Nhlemeza. So, in following up on that in 
early February 2015… (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry. Now I hear, I see there is a reference to 
General Nhlemeza. Had he become head of DPCI in the meantime? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair he did. Unfortunately, 
at that specific part of the where we deal with that is a little bit later in 
the affidavit. But he did become the head in more or less the end of 
December 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He replaced General Dramat was 
suspended and he replaced General Dramat. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I can take. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I think that paragraph, it’s just that it comes 
immediately after a paragraph that refers to February 2015 or did you 
20 
say he came, he became head end of 2014? Maybe that paragraph is. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the end of 2014. That is correct, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so that paragraph is just a wrongly located? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is correctly located but in the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 171 of 233 
 
context of what I am discussing here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. Yes?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, Brigadier Chili said he didn’t see any problem in 
the declassification of the documents. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. I must just 
follow the procedure through the office of the national head of the 
DPCI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did you then do that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I then prompt a meeting with 
10 
General Zulu and General Nhlemeza in Pretoria. I told them about 
numerous written request for declassification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say the meeting now was, it was your soft, 
General Zulu and who? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Nhlemeza. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The three of you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Zulu acknowledged 
receipt of the request but indicated that such a request should come 
20 
from the office of General Nhlemeza. General Nhlemeza informed 
General Zulu that he would facilitate such a request through his office. 
General Zulu… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that meeting would have been around February 
2015 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 172 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is 16 February okay? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It is on the 16 t h of February 2015. 
That’s correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Zulu informed me that it 
was only the national Commissioner who could declassify the 
documents. I informed General Zulu that I know the process that needs 
to be followed and the request in the declassification. But I had stated 
as much in my request and that I had stated as much in my request to 
10 
Brigadier Ntuli on the 23 r d of January 2015. I also explained to her that 
I had approached her office not to immediately declassify the 
documents but to start a process in which a risk assessment can be 
done in order to assist her to apply her mind. Meaning her mind, I’m 
referring now to the national Commissioner. I left the meeting under the 
impression that the reason for the declassification request had been 
clarified and the request will be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Well, I’m not sure, why did you think that? Why 
did you think that the reason for or you say it’s the reason, it’s your 
reason for the request that you say you thought had been clarified? In 
20 
which case, you would 
have been 
the 
person who 
provided 
clarification? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright. Yes, but the reason that had been 
given there, no reason had been given there to justify why after that 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 173 of 233 
 
point you had not been given cooperation. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. Nothing was said to me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You were just told that the request 
must come through General Nhlemeza’s office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had never been told that before all those two 
and a half or more years? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. All the other requests 
came through the various offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and there was no objection to. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And there was no objection to it. In 
this specific instance when I spoke to Brigadier Ntuli, it was arranged 
by Brigadier Van Graan. I was under the impression it had, he also 
spoke to General Zulu prior to me meeting him. I do not know if he had 
prior meetings with General Zulu before I spoke to him. He must have 
given that request to General Zulu because he was aware of the 
request. And she then said, that I must just, I must refer the request to 
her via General Nhlemeza’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But pre… I mean General Mdluli was, General 
Nhlemeza was taking the place of General Dramat. Previous request 
20 
that had come through to General Zulu had come through from General 
Dramat’s office. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she had not cooperated. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 174 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, the fact that this request had not come through 
the office of the head of DPCI not have been the reason why there had 
been no cooperation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But I had to jump the hoops. So, I 
thought I will jump through this hoop as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you wanted to see if there will be a change of 
attitude now. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What then transpired? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, on the 10 t h of March 2015, 
the NDPP informed General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard that they will 
appear in the SCC Chair’s commercial crimes court on the 1 s t of April 
2015. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what happened also but also in 
March 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  In March 2015… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, hang on. Before we get there, we have got to 
20 
follow up on this meeting. At the end of this meeting which involved 
yourself, General Zulu and General Nhlemeza. The meeting ended on 
the basis that the request had to be made through General Nhlemeza. I 
would imagine that after that meeting, you would have pursued that 
through that office. Did you and if you did what happened? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 175 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I did. I did not receive 
anything back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did General Nhlemeza send a request too? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  What I do know is I received from 
General Moodley in March 2015 where he requested me to provide a 
report explaining who had given me the mandate and authority to 
investigate 
crime 
intelligence; 
the 
crime 
intelligence 
criminal 
investigation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay before we get there, let’s just finish the one 
part. So, after the meeting that you had had the three of you yourself, 
General Mdluli and General Zulu you were supposed to pursue through 
General Nhlemeza’s office the request. You say you did do that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, did you do that by way of a letter, email or 
whatever that you sent to General Nhlemeza? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I cannot remember because 
I cannot find the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Relating to that but what I’ve done 
is I have sent the same request through to General Nhlemeza that I 
have already given to Mdluli and Ntuli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And did he ever report back to you to say he had 
sent a letter or passed it on to General Zulu? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 176 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. I did not receive any 
letter. The first letter I received was in or request that I received was in 
March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the one from Brigadier Moodley? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now around about, when was it when this meeting 
was held there of the three of you? Are you able to remember? 
February 2015, March 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was on the 16 t h of February 
2015, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 16 February. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That’s correct, Chair. Paragraph 
190. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. So, you and Brigadier Moodley, what was his 
position again? Where does he fit in? Again, just remind me? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, he was my, he was the head 
of ACTT at the time anticorruption task team that fell. He was the direct 
head. So, he was my direct head. He was the national head of the 
anticorruption task team based in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were under his section or unit? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, he would be the person you reported to? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. I report… Normally in 
the time of General Dramat I would report to both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 177 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  They would give me a call and I 
would report to both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But ultimately, I reported to 
General Dramat. With General Nhlemeza I was reporting to Brigadier 
Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Only. Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Now so, by the time you got this request from 
Brigadier Moodley in March, you say General Nhlemeza had not come 
10 
back to you to tell you whether he had passed on the request, your 
request to General Zulu? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. He hadn’t come back to 
me at that time, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and then you got this request from 
Brigadier Moodley. Okay just talk about it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the request that I received 
from Brigadier Moodley is I have to provide them with a report as to 
who had given me the mandate, authority to investigate crime 
intelligence criminal investigations. Brigadier Moodley informed me that 
20 
General Nhlemeza requested the information. I was not provided with 
the reason for the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this strange to you that you should get this 
instruction to provide such a report or explanation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, what I can state regarding 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 178 of 233 
 
Brigadier Moodley, he also did not know the reason for the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  What I can state regarding 
Brigadier Moodley, he also did not know the reason for the report but it 
was strange to me. But following from the previous discussion that I 
had… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I need to follow that, you say he 
did not know what? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No what I am saying is that when 
Brigadier Moodley asked me for this report, as requested by General 
10 
Nhlemeza he also didn’t have any reasons – no reasons was provided 
to him as to why he needs to ask me for this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, this didn’t come from him as such, he was just – 
he was a conduit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He was a conduit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The person who wanted this report was General 
Nhlemeza? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is what he told you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And that is what he told me and 
20 
based on that I provided Brigadier Moodley with the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but General Nhlemeza had been with you at the 
meeting with General Zulu, I would have imagined that before that 
meeting he would have had a meeting with you where you would have 
briefed him what this was all about, did that happen? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 179 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No Chair and ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t get a chance to give him a briefing before 
that meeting? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I did brief General 
Nhlemeza I am not sure if I speak about this later in my affidavit, but I 
did give him a briefing, a full briefing, explaining exactly what was the 
allegations, and the investigation.   He got very perturbed with me, very 
angry and ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is after the meeting? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That was ...[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you can’t remember? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That was – that I can’t remember, 
I think it was just after the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But I will have to go back to my 
affidavit and listen and I will see exactly what date did I put down 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay so you prepared a report in accordance 
with the request that Brigadier Moodley had told you about? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay do you want to take from there Ms 
September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair.  I do not ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see we are at five past, I think from side I can try to 
go up to five, Mr Roelofse is that fine with you? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 180 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It’s fine with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s with you, is it fine? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Absolutely fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s try and continue, yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then take you to Annexure 
KDR38 which is – starts at paragraph – page 371.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This appears to be an email that is 
authored by yourself sent on 19 t h March 2015 at 15:39, sent to K 
Moodley, Brigadier and there are two individuals who are cc’d with one 
10 
attachment.  It appears that this particular communication not only 
attaches the document which you prepared, but can I ask you to read 
paragraph into the record please. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I will do so Chair, paragraph 3: 
“I would also ...” 
That is the paragraph that you’re referring to? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:    
“I would also like to make a formal request to brief General 
Nhlemeza regarding this matter.  He needs to understand the 
20 
essence of the matter and that it is purely related on – further 
related purely related to alleged criminal activities.  One 
cannot continuously rehash the same issues over and over 
again.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If I can then ask you to turn to the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 181 of 233 
 
next Annexure, which is Annexure 39, beginning on page 373. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   This appears again to be a 
document that is authored by yourself dated 3 February 2014 
addressed to the head of division Crime Intelligence, is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, this is a 
draft report that I drew up and provided to General – to Brigadier 
Moodley for his signature before it went to General Nhlemeza. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you know whether or not your 
communication was in fact sent to the office of General Nhlemeza 
10 
through the office of Brigadier Moodley? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I cannot at this point 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you should ...[intervenes] 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   He would have sent it through, I 
cannot remember whether I received any confirmation of the document, 
because later on he does speak to this. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So let me take you then to 
paragraph 194 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, before that, I saw that you said you 
20 
prepared the document as if it was his, that is Brigadier Moodley, so 
did I see that the document appears to have your name, have I lost you 
or ... 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No, no you are quite correct 
Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 182 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, so I thought if you had prepared it as if it 
was coming from his office you would have his name. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I prepared it as if from Brigadier 
Moodley’s office but I would be the person that would be on the left 
side top as the person to be contacted if there is an enquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But unless we – unless I am confusing the 
documents, the one that we just looked at I think has your name at the 
bottom, where I would have expected you to put Brigadier Moodley’s 
name if the idea was that you were just drafting it for him. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Chair do you refer to page 
10 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page were we on? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   375. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one we have just looked at? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes Chair, that’s the end of that 
particular document, signed off by Mr Roelofse. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think what happened is I 
used one of the old documents that I had, one of the drafts, so this was 
being corrected by Brigadier Moodley before he sent it off General 
Nhlemeza. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, so you – what you expected was that he 
would convert the document that you provided to be on his letterheads 
and then he will put his name at the end. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair, he would 
have given it to his assistant. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 183 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   To do that – to do those changes 
yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you don’t know whether he did that and 
passed that and sent that to General Nhlemeza or do you know? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair he did say to me that he did 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did so yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I did not see a confirmation but 
he did inform me that he did send it on to General Nhlemeza. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And so going back to page 57 of 
your affidavit did you follow up with Brigadier Moodley in regard to this 
communication? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair on the 30 t h of March I 
sent an email to Brigadier Moodley requesting feedback.  Brigadier 
Moodley informed me that he was also awaiting feedback in respect of 
the document that I provided, or the document that he provided as was 
requested.  At the time I had to attend to two matters that were due in 
court on the 1 s t of April 2015 and the 2 n d of April 2015 respectively.   
20 
The one matter related to the pending prosecution of Colonel Barnard 
and General Lazarus, which was already before Court, and the other 
matter related to the re-enrolment of the General Mdluli matter on the 
1 s t of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s go back to your report that was requested by 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 184 of 233 
 
General Nhlemeza through Brigadier Moodley, as I understand your 
evidence ...[indistinct] wanted to know where you got the authority from 
to investigate Crime Intelligence people, is my understanding correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now was that something – is that the normal kind of 
thing that the Head of the Hawks would ask any member of the Hawks 
who was doing an investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I think at this point in time 
within the SAPS there is a misconception as to what – the 
misconception as to management’s role in investigations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   The investigation or a criminal 
investigation is conducted in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, the 
Constitution and the South African Police Act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Now there is a growing concern in 
me regarding that in that senior management thinks sometimes that 
they are the individuals that will tell you what to and when to 
investigate something, not taking into account the various Acts that 
does exist and that does deal with this.   So I do not know whether that 
20 
was his standpoint for asking this, but he was welcome to ask the 
question and I would have explained to him because there was nothing 
untoward in terms of the investigation itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well I understand that question to have been 
based on an understanding that you might not have had authority to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 185 of 233 
 
investigate and that you might have needed somebody to authorise you 
to investigate, is that how you understood it as well, that question? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is so Chair, that is how I 
understood it.  If there’s a – if a crime has been committed the 
authorisation to investigate that follows from the Acts does not follow 
from a member from SAPS saying now you can investigate that or now 
you can’t, it falls within the mandate of the DPCI, I was requested by  
General Dramat to do the investigation, so to me there was not even – 
it was a non-issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, now how did you respond to this question in 
10 
the document that you prepared, without reading, it’s just the gist? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair what I’ve done is in that 
report I would have explained to him again the background as to this 
investigation in other words as from August 2011, how the investigation 
came about, how we were approached by members of Crime 
Intelligence and what we subsequently found after speaking to them 
and our further investigation, that would have been the background of 
my letter, together with the agreement with SAPS the two different 
departments, Crime Intelligence and the Hawks, as happened in I think 
it was September 2011.  That would have been the basis for, or the 
20 
background as to my report to him that – because that would have 
covered the mandate as well as why are we investigating this specific 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then Mr Roelofse with these 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 186 of 233 
 
pending prosecutions against both Colonel Barnard and General 
Lazarus and also with the re-enrolment of the matter against General 
Mdluli is it to be understood that an urgency was being – was created 
due to these looming prosecutions? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair this matter that was 
being, we were instructed to re-enrol the matter and it was based on 
the Supreme Court of Appeal decision, so it becomes very important 
that we adhered to what the Supreme Court has decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And so it became very critical that 
10 
the documentation at this point in time had to be declassified because 
we have to continue with the prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   So because of that I then asked 
Brigadier Moodley to resubmit the – my 23 January 2015 letter which 
was given to Brigadier Mdluli to General Nhlemeza to ensure that his 
office would forward the request for assistance to Crime Intelligence.  
Brigadier Moodley told me that he did send it through to the office of 
General Nhlemeza.  I do not know whether General Nhlemeza 
forwarded that request to Crime Intelligence, I have not received any 
20 
information that it was or was not forwarded.   
 
On the 28 t h of April I requested a meeting with the National 
Prosecuting Authority, General Nhlemeza and myself to discuss the re-
enrolment of the ...[indistinct] matter, the Mdluli Barnard criminal 
matter. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 187 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But by this time had it already been re-enrolled or not 
yet? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It had been re-enrolled Chair 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  For 1 April? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was already on the roll for a 
month at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I also did not receive any 
feedback, the proposed meeting never took place. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   What then happened during May 
2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   In May 2015 Brigadier van Graan 
contacted me and informed me that his legal office had received 
correspondence from General Zulu regarding my request to declassify 
the documents which had – which he then forwarded to me on the 14 t h 
of May 2015.  A copy of the correspondence is attached as per 
Annexure KD40.  It appears from that correspondence that – and in 
terms of paragraph 197.1 that General Flip Jacobs, PC Jacobs, Head 
Operational Legal Support at the Division Legal Services and Policy 
20 
Services, were informed that officials investigating the matter decided 
to approach his office and ignored the request from CI.  General Zulu 
informed General Nhlemeza that if I wanted to request documentation 
from Crime Intelligence I need to do so through his office and that I 
need to explain how I came into possession of the documents to be 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 188 of 233 
 
classified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this issue comes back that you must explain how 
you got the documents you had? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Then on the 15 t h of May 2015 what 
transpired? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair Advocate Rossouw 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, let’s make sure Ms September we tie these 
10 
things together, on the 28 t h of April the witness requested a meeting, 
what happened to that request? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   I received no feedback in terms of 
my request Chair, and the meeting never took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you had directed the request to the NPA 
General Nhlemeza and to General Themeza? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, none of them responded? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   As far as I can remember 
Advocate Rossouw did respond but I can’t specifically remember Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   But I think the importance of it is 
that that proposed meeting never took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Did the office of the NDPP at the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 189 of 233 
 
time get involved in the request for declassification of documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Yes Chair, on the 15 t h of May 
Advocate Rossouw he was one of the prosecutors that was now 
appointed to assist in the investigation, to prosecute the matter.  He 
informed me that the NDPP Mr Nkolisi, this is now my pronunciation, Mr 
Nxesana, had written a letter to the National Commissioner of the SAPS 
at the time General Riah Phiyega.  Mr Ntana requested General 
Phiyega assistance to declassify the documents, that had to be 
provided to the accused defence counsel by no later than 20 May 2015, 
the next court appearance date, see Annexure KDR41.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I then take you to page, to that 
Annexure 41 which starts at page 390.   Is this the document that you 
are aware of which was authored by the NDPP’s office Mr Xolisi 
Nxesana dated 14 May 2015 and addressed to the National 
Commissioner of Police who at the time was General Phiyega? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And whilst this document really 
gives an extensive account can you identify the important features of 
this document please, as you understand it to be. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair it sets out again the 
20 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am sorry, will it say anything that he hasn’t 
dealt with?  I imagine the background and the reasons must be the 
same as the reasons he has told us about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Indeed. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 190 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless there is something new that hadn’t been there 
before otherwise I don’t want us to go back and say something, deal 
with something that he has already told me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   No problem Chair.  If I can then ask 
you to turn to page 396. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair if I may I would also just 
like to refer to paragraph 10 on 393, where the NDPP is saying 
...[intervenes] 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   No I am referring to paragraph 
10, 393. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  393?  Okay let’s get there first, yes? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This is the NDPP saying it is my 
understanding that there is no reasonable risk that the declassification 
and disclosure for official purposes might constitute a breach of State 
Security methods or police investigation and the identity of informers. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Is it correct that at paragraph 13 on 
the next page of 394 Mr Nxasana informs about, or rather confirms your 
communication with Brigadier Mdluli dated the 23 r d of January 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And then can I take you to page 396 
20 
at paragraph 20, the document then puts a date deadline which is 
relative to the next court appearance and requests as follows: 
“Kindly take note that a copy of the classified documents 
would need to be provided to the defence by no later than the 
next court appearance namely 20 May 2015.” 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 191 of 233 
 
And in paragraph 22 it informs that: 
“the investigating officer Colonel Roelofse can provide access 
to the relevant official delegated to declassify the documents 
as per Annexure A a copy of which appears to be attached 
from pages 398 to page 401.” 
Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Do you have any comments to the 
date on which the documents ought to have been provided and also the 
assertion that you could assist in this regard? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I have not – I haven’t 
received any feedback regarding this request, no documents were 
declassified and on the 20 t h of May and subsequent after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The document from Mr Nxasana to the National 
Commissioner is quite comprehensive. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many pages is it Ms September? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   It appears to be 8 pages Chair, with 
a signature on the eight page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it’s quite a, it’s ...[indistinct] and it’s subject is – 
20 
includes requests for the declassification of documents and it is 
addressed to Ms Phiyega that was the National Commissioner of Police 
at the time.  What is it dated?  The date must be at the ...[intervenes] 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The date of it appears on page 397 
as 14 May 2015. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 192 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, as far as you know was there ever a response 
from Ms Phiyega to Mr Nxasana? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair I am not aware of a 
response to the NDPP, I was also not given a response from the NDPP, 
what I can say is that nothing happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   This did not – the request was not 
honoured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that date of this document again? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   14 May 2015, of Mr Nxasana’s 
10 
document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Yes, 14 t h May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay he then left the NPA in I think August 2015 if I’m 
not mistaken, he has given evidence here, and there’s a judgment in 
the Constitutional Court about his departure from the NPA so this was 
May 2015. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   14 May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  14 May 2015, so he might or might not have had time 
to share with you whatever response might have arrived if it did arrive, 
20 
we don’t k now. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair that is so but I would have 
expected that the prosecutors in the matter would have shared the 
correspondence with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, if there was a response. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 193 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   And if there was a response 
either way, whether it was now yes we can declassify or no we cannot 
declassify I would have been informed of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja.  Yes, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Mr Roelofse what happened then 
three days later on the 18 t h of May 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the date you are talking about now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  18 May 2015, which is actually four 
days after the date of Mr Nxasana’s letter, we are on page 58 of the 
10 
affidavit, paragraph 199. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair on the 18 t h of May Brigadier 
Moodley informed me that he had to attend a meeting with General 
Phiyega regarding the request from the NDPP.  Brigadier Moodley 
asked me to compile a report setting out first how the documents came 
into my possession and secondly provide General Phiyega with copies 
of the classified documents in order for her to apply her mind to the 
request.  The original documents would then be supplied once she has 
made a decision. On the 8 t h of June I provided Brigadier Moodley with 
my report and copies of the classified documents as requested.  My 
20 
report was presented to General Phiyega under cover of enclosing 
letters, I attached these documents as Annexure KDR42. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And KDR42 we can find starting at 
page 403. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 194 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   The document that appears at 403 is 
signed by Major General – or not signed but it is marked for signature 
by Major General Nhlemeza, it is dated the 9 t h of June 2015 and it is 
addressed to the National Commissioner of Police by subject title 
declassification of classified documents. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And the document that is in 
enclosed with this document please identify it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair it is on page 404 it is a 
cover letter from Brigadier Moodley which indicate please see attached 
10 
report from Colonel Roelofse and then again then there is this my 
document classified, declassification of classified documents, Silverton 
CAS 155/7/2011 for theft and/or corruption and Lyttleton CAS 
432/11/2001 for theft and/or corruption.  The document is dated the 8 t h 
of June 2015 and once again I explain how it came about that we did 
the investigation, where we received the documents from and I gave a 
background as to the allegations that were made. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   If one then turns to the next 
annexure, which is Annexure 43 at page 424, this is a communication 
that has been sent to Major General P R Vuma dated 10 June 2015, 
20 
what is the purpose of this document for purposes of your evidence? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   Chair this is not – it was not a 
document that was sent, this was a document prepared by Captain 
McLean who was a warrant officer at the time, I requested him to take 
per hand the documentation requested and otherwise the copies of the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 195 of 233 
 
documents that needs to be declassified together with the report to the 
office of the National Commissioner. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And who was the National 
Commissioner at the time? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   It was General Phiyega. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And what happened when General 
Vuma attended the office to deliver the documents? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   She received the documents and 
she signed for the documents on the 10 t h of June 2015. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What then transpired on the 19 t h of 
10 
June 2015?  If you go back to page 59 of your affidavit. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  On the 19 t h of June 2015, I had to 
arrange for the collection of the documents from the office of the 
national Commissioner because there was an issue with the authority of 
the person who delivered the documents which General Vuma received. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So, it was not accurate when you 
said that, on the 10 t h of June 2015 all was good and well for receipt of 
the documents by the office of the national Commissioner? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, it was received by the office 
of the national Commissioner via General Vuma on the 19 t h of June 
20 
2015. In the meantime, I have been reprimanded by General Nhlemeza 
for sending Warrant Officer McLean at the time to the office of the 
national Commissioner to deliver the documents because I still do not 
know exactly the reason why. I don’t know whether Warrant Officer 
McLean wasn’t fit and proper to go and deliver the documents, whether 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 196 of 233 
 
his rank was not high enough. It just didn’t make sense to me and in 
terms of that I was then given an instruction to get the documentation 
back from the office of the national Commissioner on the 19 t h June 
2015. During which those documents were then collected again and 
came back to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, you had caused the relevant documents to be 
taken to the office of the national Commissioner and General Vuma was 
the person in the office of the national Commissioner who had received 
the documents. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But after that you were reprimanded by General 
Nhlemeza for sending whoever you sent there to take the documents 
there. Is that correct? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the basis for reprimanding you? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m still trying to find out, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when he spoke to you, what was the objection? 
Was it that those documents had been taken there or was his objection 
to the identity of the person that you sent to take the documents there? 
Or was it that you sent those documents there without going through 
20 
his office? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the documents were sent 
through his office. The cover letter was prepared by his office. We 
merely facilitated taking the documents to the national Commissioner’s 
office. The letter that was drawn up as an acknowledgment of receipt 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 197 of 233 
 
for the documentation that we are providing to the office of the national 
Commissioner, Warrant Officer McLean drew up that letter. It’s not a 
formal letter. It could have been a piece of paper so that we can have 
record that the documentation were actually delivered and received. 
Now I still cannot understand whether that was his objection that that 
letter of receipt didn’t go through his office or whether it was the fact 
that Captain McLean or Warrant Officer McLean took the documents to 
the office of the national Commissioner. It was just, it’s just didn’t make 
sense to me. The reasoning didn’t make sense. It is something that 
should not have happened. The documents were delivered properly 
10 
through his office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I was about to say you may have skipped 
something that you had mentioned in passing earlier. You in answer to 
a question I put to you, you said that you did get a chance to explain to 
General Nhlemeza after the meeting that you had with him and General 
Zulu. You did get a chance to explain to him what the investigation was 
about. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The declassification. But you, I think you said that his 
reaction was not good. Do you want to cover that because I think we 
20 
may have passed that now? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Okay. Chair, what happened there 
is the fact that when I sat there and Brigadier Moodley was with me, he 
attended the meeting with me. General Nhlemeza said to me the 
following and this is not verbatim. I’m just, this is how I remember this. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 198 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He said to me that, why are we 
investigating this he previous crime intelligence still and he referred to 
one individual that was locked up from the previous… (indistinct). He 
referred to Eugene De Cock and you allowed him to do this. It is now 
our time to do it. And I was, I really I was taken aback. I thought to 
myself, what are you talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat again. I know that you said you are 
not quoting him but just repeat the substance of what he said. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the substance basically 
10 
boils down to it happened with the previous, in the previous 
government. People stole and why am I investigating what is happening 
now. It is now, something to the effect, it is now my time or our time to 
eat and I was totally. I just sat there and I thought this is not 
happening. I’m not hearing correctly. I left the office together with 
Brigadier Moodley and… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was Brigadier Moodley’s reaction to what you 
heard? Did he hear it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was the same, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what did you or Brigadier Moodley say in 
20 
response to this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, what do I say in response to 
that? I mean it is a nonsensical remark. It is not going to take me 
forward. All that is going to happen is that we will get into some other 
altercation. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 199 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Argument. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  An argument. So, I wasn’t 
prepared to go into that kind of thing. So, we shortly after that we left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically, he didn’t want the investigation to 
continue? He wanted it to be stopped. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. He wanted 
it to be stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because based on what he said to you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I didn’t mention this earlier. It is 
mentioned later in the affidavit. He was a friend of General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was a friend? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  A friend of General Mdluli and if 
you and if further my testimony you will see I deal with his assistance 
with the Vosloorus matter as requested by General Mdluli. So, in that 
when that sense I wasn’t surprised that he didn’t want us to continue. I 
was surprised by the words that he used or the reason that he used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And after that remark that was the end of the 
meeting? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That was the end, Chair. There 
was no, there is no point in meeting any further 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But prior to that… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he meant it in all seriousness? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 200 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I remember him vividly 
standing up and grabbing his jacket and coming sitting back down again 
and he said, that I can only work with people that I can trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he said? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   That is what he said. So, it is to 
me it was not the kind of reaction I expected. It was not the kind of 
treatment and reaction that I received from General Dramat. I wasn’t 
used to that kind of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, effectively his remark was, allow us to eat. It’s 
our turn. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you left the office and left that meeting, did you 
reflect on whether this investigation that you had been working on for 
so long had any chance of continuing? Or did you think that you would 
handle, you would continue with investigation as far as you could as 
long as it didn’t stand in your way? Or what was the effect as you 
reflected on this remark and the fact that you had an investigation that 
you wanted to pursue? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I was, it was a difficult 
meeting to attend. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Yes, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry, Mr Roelofse when the 
documents were then collected from the office of General Phiyega, was 
it resubmitted at a later stage? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes Chair, it was resubmitted. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 201 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to go to Annexure 44 
at page 426 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  426. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  This document appears to be a 
document dated the 1 s t of July 2015, signed by Major General 
Nhlemeza and addressed to the national Commissioner under a heading 
of declassification of classified documents Silverton case 155/07/2011 
with further detail that follows. What is this document, Colonel 
10 
Roelofse? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, this document is again a 
cover letter for the same documents that I have to provide to the office 
of the national Commissioner. This document, the difference between 
this document and the previous one, the previous one was generic in 
saying that enclosed please find the following documents. This 
document prepared by General Major and signed by him. If I may read 
into the record it says the following; 
Please find the attached report of the 
investigator, Colonel K Roelofse regarding above-
20 
mentioned declassification of classified documents. 
However, 
this 
office 
is 
concerned 
as 
to 
the 
circumstances that prevailed in the manner in which 
the possessor… (indistinct) officer could have been 
allowed given access to the classified information. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 202 of 233 
 
Albeit the fact that he never had a valid security 
clearance at the moment and at this current juncture. 
Currently acknowledge receipt of duplicate hereof.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So, this is a letter from General Nhlemeza going to 
the national Commissioner of police? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  General Phiyega, is the head of your organization? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you seek these documents but he doesn’t seem 
to be in support of the pursuit of these documents, the declassification 
10 
or is that not the understanding you have from this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, they are just putting it 
mildly this. That’s exactly the understanding that I have and not only 
that. The second part of this letter apart from the fact that he is 
accusing me that I’m not supposed to have the document. The 
classified information albeit the fact that he never had a valid security 
clearance at the moment and at that current juncture which is not true. 
I had a security, top security clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  There was no, there’s no basis for 
him to say this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he didn’t… Did he ever raise the issue of 
clearance with you? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 203 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. He has never raised 
that with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but if you wanted to he could have and you would 
have told him and if he wanted to check without you knowing, he could 
have, he would have found that you did have? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. He had, if 
you didn’t want to ask me he had access to the database which would 
tell him I had clearance or I didn’t have clearance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but also if he had concerns that you might not 
have clearance one would have expected him to talk to you before 
10 
writing to somebody outside of the organization and raising that issue. 
One would have expected that he would have raised it with you first. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  One would have expected that, 
Chair. I think this was done deliberately and was malice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you say he knew that it was not true or he 
must have known it was untrue. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He must have known before he has 
written this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Because it wasn’t true. I would 
20 
have expected at least from a man in his position that he would have 
made sure that if he made a statement like that that it is actually true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Let me go back to when you sent the report that 
he requested through Brigadier Moodley. After he had received that 
report of which dealt with where you got the authority from to conduct 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 204 of 233 
 
this investigation. Did he ever come back to you and say anything like, 
no but this is not you know your explanation is not acceptable? This 
doesn’t give you authority and say anything? Did you ever get any 
reaction from him in writing or did he talk to you about it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. I never received 
anything in writing with regards to my explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  As to why we were busy with this 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was always the request and the 
accusation but there was never a response after it was, after I 
responded to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you mentioned something and we didn’t deal with 
it earlier on when you talked about the meeting that you had with him 
together with Brigadier Moodley when you told you about that being 
their turn to eat. I think you said something like he said, he could only 
work with people that he trusted. Did I understand you correctly? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the context of that remark? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The context is that if he tells me to 
and this is how I understood it on. The context is if he tells me not to 
do something even if it’s illegal then I need to listen to him and if I 
don’t then he cannot work with me because he cannot trust me. And I’m 
not, I won’t adhere to that kind of request. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 205 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to throw more light in the discussion 
how it came in? How did it come in? Was it because he expected you 
not to proceed with the investigation? Was he suggesting that if you 
proceeded with the investigation after that meeting, it would mean that 
he could not trust you? Therefore, he could not work with you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the comments came after I 
gave him feedback in terms of what we are investigating. In other 
words, I explained to him as I did to this Commission. Obviously not 
two long day explanation but I explained to him as to the investigation 
that we dealt with. He became very angry when I explained as to what 
10 
we have uncovered and that triggered the reaction where he asked me 
but to give us the authority or and why are we investigating. This is 
not… You didn’t do this when with Eugene De Cooks. So, why are you 
doing this in our time to eat? And also, in that same within that same 
let’s call it timeframe that is when he stood up and he, and I could see 
he was very angry with me. And he said that but I can’t trust you. He 
didn’t there say to me that I cannot investigate the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, he didn’t put it expressly. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He didn’t expressly put it there to 
me that I cannot investigate the matter. I knew… (intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was it clear to you that he did not want to you to 
continue the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was clear to me that he did not 
want me to continue with the investigation, yes Chair. But in the 
absence of him giving me a direct. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 206 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Instruction. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Instruction, I was going to 
continue with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Roelofse, you will recall that the 
letter Mr Xolisi Xosana dated the 14 t h of May 2015 requested that the 
classified documents would need to be provided to the defence by no 
later than the next Court appearance on the 20 t h of May 2015. Are you 
aware as to whether or not that was complied with? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, it was not complied with. 
10 
My… the last… My last knowledge of the… The last thing that I was 
involved in was the resubmission of the documentation, copies of the 
documentation that needs to be reclassified or declassified. I have not 
received any formal communication verbally nor written regarding the 
decision of the national Commissioner. All I know it didn’t happen 
because when we attended the Court appearance on the 6 t h of July, the 
documentation has not been, wasn’t declassified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is the 6 t h of July 2015. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct to understand the position to be that 
20 
after the meeting that you have told me about between yourself, 
Brigadier Moodley and General Nhlemeza where he made the remark 
that we have discussed. He, that is General Nhlemeza did have a role 
in regard to attempts to declassify the documents. He did write to you 
to General Phiyega. There was that letter that we talked about earlier 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 207 of 233 
 
where he was raising the question of how you came to be in possession 
of documents. So, am I correct to say he did play the role of writing to 
her? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I would more call it he did, I 
think it was, I think it was for appearance sake trying to lure me into a 
situation where I think he will be assisting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But as I said, it is my view of the 
matter. I do not know exactly what was going on as yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your perspective is that he was doing this 
because maybe it would be difficult to open. They say this investigation 
must stop. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. If you look 
at the trend of what happened in terms of my testimony, there was 
always something. There was never a no. There was always just 
something you know, go and fetch the documents. It wasn’t delivered 
properly. Go do this or go do that. There is always something else but 
not the actual reason. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And Mr Roelofse, what was your 
understanding of the reason for the matter being struck from the roll, 
the Mdluli/Barnard matter as you have referred to it in your affidavit? 
Being struck from the roll on the 6 t h of July 2015. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 208 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the reason was quite 
simple. It was the documentation that we had to, the documentation 
that needed to be provided to the defence in a declassified format was 
not available to provide to the defence. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And were there any additional 
accused’s who were added to the matter at the stage by this time 
rather? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. At the earlier 
appearance, General Lazarus was also added in respect of the specific 
case. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to what extent were the charges 
relating to the secret services account of the police? We accept, we 
understand the charges as against, the fraud and corruption charges 
against General Mdluli and Colonel Barnard. What were the charges 
against General Lazarus? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was similar charges because we 
now were looking at, it was fraud corruption. There were additional 
charges as well. There was a comprehensive charge sheet that was 
drawn up and it now know included the other matters as I explained 
earlier in respect of the China trip and the Singapore trip and 
20 
appointment of family members. So, it included that as well. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 
428 which is Annexure 45 to your affidavit? Do you recognize this 
document? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. It is an email that I 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 209 of 233 
 
wrote to and I addressed it to Brigadier Moodley. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so, it is dated the 6 t h of July 
2015 at 14h41 sent by yourself to Brigadier Moodley. And what 
triggered you sending this email? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  The withdrawal of the matter and 
the reason for the withdrawal for the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be an important email. Maybe he could read 
the whole of it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair. Please read this email 
into the record. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:   
“Dear Brigadier Moodley, I have carefully considered my email 
before forwarding it to you. I also wish to reiterate that I 
appreciate the difficult situation you found yourself in. I further 
wish to state ...” ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you like an adjournment? Would you like me to 
take five minutes? Okay let’s, maybe let’s take more than five minutes. 
Maybe let’s take 10 minutes. Oh, we are about to be 5 o’clock. Let’s 
take 10 minutes and then when we come back, we can talk further as to 
what is to happen. Mr Roelofse, I just want you to know that I am 
20 
interested in getting a full picture of how people like you might have 
been feeling when they were going through certain situations. So, I just 
want you to know that I do want to understand the full picture. So, we 
will take an adjournment and come back at 10 past. We adjourn. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases the Chair 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 210 of 233 
 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Roelofse, how are you feeling? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m fine thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are fine? Okay thank you. I think… (intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you switch the mic on please? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think read that email. After you have read it, we will 
talk about the way forward in terms of finishing your evidence. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, it’s fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. This is the email that is at page 428? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. You can read. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Thank you, Chair. The email is 
addressed to Brigadier Moodley.  
I have carefully considered my email below before 
forwarding it to you. I also wish to reiterate that I appreciate 
the difficult position or situation that you find yourself in. I 
further wish to state that whatever I allude to in my email does 
20 
not include you. As far as I’m concerned, you will have tried 
your utmost to help and receive and resolve the situation. The 
above-mentioned matter has been struck of the Court roll 
today. The defence in this matter has successfully argued that 
the accused cannot prepare their case without access to all 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 211 of 233 
 
the documents. In this regard, the defence referred to the 
classified documents not yet handed to the accused. The 
magistrate in his judgment said that the case can only be 
placed 
back 
on 
the 
Court 
roll 
once 
the 
classified 
documentation or documents are declassified. In this regard, I 
would like to refer you to the numerous attempts since 2012 
made for myself and the NPA to get same declassified. I would 
further would like to refer you to a memorandum I compiled for 
Major General Nhlemeza at his request in which I sent out all 
the attempts made to get the above-mentioned documents 
10 
declassified. I have not received feedback with respect to this. 
On 15 May 2015, the then NDPP intervened and requested that 
the national Commissioner to declassify the documents 
mentioned above as it is needed as an Exhibit or as Exhibits 
before Court. On 6 June 2015, I submitted a comprehensive 
report to yourself regarding the request for declassification. I 
understood this was required after attending a meeting with 
the national Commissioner. This meeting was in response to 
the request of the NDPP. This report was handed to the office 
of the national Commissioner on 10 June 2015. In this regard, 
20 
I need 
to 
point 
out 
that 
the report to 
the national 
Commissioner went under my signature. I was informed that 
you were instructed to just provide the cover letter in respect 
of my request. I further would like to point out that the national 
heads for the DPC are attached and an unsigned cover letter 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 212 of 233 
 
to the application in question. I do not mind signing the 
request for declassification but I cannot help to think that I do 
not have the support of the acting national head of the DPCI. 
On 19 June 2015, I was requested to fetch the application in 
question. I was then informed that neither the request of the 
NDPP nor the covering letter of the national head of the DPCI 
was signed. In light thereof, I was informed that the national 
Commissioner indicated she would not attend to the request. 
In light thereof, I resubmitted my application to the national 
Commissioner via the office of the head of the DPCI on 1 July 
10 
2015. I received my application back from the office of the 
national Commissioner of the DPCI, national head of the DPCI 
on the same date. Attached to it was a signed cover letter 
signed by Major General Nhlemeza. Major General Nhlemeza 
states the following in paragraph two of his covering letter. 
However, this office is concerned as the circumstances that 
resulted in the manner in which the possessor i.e. the 
investigating officer could have been allowed, given access to 
the classified information. Albeit the fact that he never had a 
valid security clearance at the moment and at this current 
20 
juncture. He does state in his cover letter that I am illegally in 
possession of said documents and I do not have clearance. 
This information is blatantly wrong and it is clear that the 
intention is to cast doubt not only on myself but also the 
process followed during the investigation. I was never 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 213 of 233 
 
requested to supply the State with my security clearance. This 
cover letter would have placed me in a very precarious 
position if it had indeed went through to the national 
Commissioner. I still have a valid security clearance. This kind 
of mistake could also have an impact on the actual matter 
before Court. If Major General Nhlemeza did read my various 
reports as requested by him, he would have knowledge as to 
how I came into possession of said documents. This is now to 
be rectified and I’m still waiting a covering letter from the 
office of the national head of the DPCI. I pointed out on 
10 
numerous occasions that the effect of the none declassification 
of said documents leads to the case being struck off the Court 
roll or to an application against the SAPS to force them to 
declassify same. We have now the embarrassing situation 
where the case was indeed struck off the Court roll. Under the 
circumstances, I’m in the cross as to what I need to do next. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, that was the email that you sent to Brigadier 
Moodley? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Maybe before we go further, we are at nearly 
20 
17h20. Maybe if everybody is still able to maybe, maybe we can go up 
to six. I’m not sure but I’m inclined to think that if Mr Roelofse is 
available tomorrow morning that we continue tomorrow morning before I 
hear the evidence of the witness who is scheduled for tomorrow. So 
that we try and finish his evidence. But obviously it would be better to 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 214 of 233 
 
take as little time tomorrow as possible but at the same time I can’t 
continue for too long. How is your situation tomorrow? How is your 
availability tomorrow morning? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I will make myself available, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will make yourself available. Maybe let’s go up to 
17h30 and then I’ll see whether I say 6 o’clock but then if we go to 6 
o’clock then we definitely stop. I think I’ll need to go and just sleep 
otherwise this flu is not going to go away. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, okay let’s continue. Did you get a response from 
10 
Brigadier Moodley to your email either by way of another email or 
discussion? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, we probably discussed 
something but I didn’t expect an email back from him with regards to 
the email that I sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. I thought you said something. Did you say there 
is something that happened? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. Sorry, what I said is, I 
didn’t expect an email back from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  But I presume we did discuss it 
afterwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. Okay you were just sharing with him your 
frustration. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 215 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you didn’t expect that there was going to be 
much else he could do himself. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. He was 
facing the same situation as I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. Is Brigadier Moodley still within DPCI? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He is, Chair. He is now the 
provincial head I think in the Free State of the DPCI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 59 of your affidavit, you were 
informed that there was an new national head of corruption who was 
10 
appointed within DPCI.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page are you now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 59. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At the bottom paragraph 204. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
Please 
elucidate 
on 
your 
engagements with this new individual, official sorry. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair this, sorry. Major General 
Zinhle Mononope was appointed as a DPCI national head corruption. 
20 
Brigadier Moodley and I briefed her shortly after her appointment 
regarding the investigation into the alleged criminal conduct of CI 
members. I could see from her reaction that she was shocked and 
expressing eagerness to assist in the investigation where she could. 
She was appointed in the vacant post in which Brigadier Moodley was 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 216 of 233 
 
acting. On the 12 t h of July 2015, I received an email with a letter dated 
10 July attached from Advocate…  (indistinct). The letter was authored 
by the new NDPP Advocate Sean Abrahams and addressed to General 
Nhlemeza requesting a meeting on 13 July 2015 at 14h00 to discuss 
the declassification of the documents which were in my possession. A 
copy of Abrahams letter is attached as per KDR46.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I don’t think that there is any need to 
address that particular Annexure because it certainly confirms what the 
evidence that you’ve just given. What then… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said early on that I thought Mr Nxasana left to the 
10 
office of the NDPP around August but I see that according to your 
affidavit already on 12 July 2015, you were receiving a letter from 
Advocate Sean Abrahams who I take it had been appointed as NDPP. 
So, I hope you have got the dates right. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair, if I may? I have actually been 
able to trace the affidavit of Mr Mxolisi Nxasana that was presented 
before the Commission. And the dates in paragraph three of his 
affidavit informs that his term of office was from 1 October 2013 to 31 
May 2015. Following which Advocate Sean Abrahams was appointed on 
the 18 t h of June 2015 to the 13 t h of August. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, he left end of May? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair which was about two 
weeks after he sent that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After he had written that letter? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 217 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So, this particular letter is then an 
invite calling you to a meeting. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What happened then on the 13 t h of 
July 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I was again summoned to 
attend a meeting at 11 o’clock convened by General Nhlemeza at a 
DPCI head office in Silverton. The meeting was attended by General 
Nhlemeza, General Mononopi, Brigadier Moodley and a person unknown 
10 
to me at the time. Before the meeting started, I was handed a document 
that I had to sign which stated that I may not divulge any classified 
information. This is sometimes done when a group discussion takes 
place in respect of the merits of an investigation. It is done to 
safeguard the integrity of the investigation. I realized after conclusion 
of the meeting that there was no reason for me to sign the document 
like that which I did. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you can just pause there for a 
second. You are called to a meeting on the same date at 2 o’clock with 
Advocate Sean Abrahams. Is that correct? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. This 
meeting is just not happening just before that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At 11 o’clock? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At 11 o’clock. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the 13 t h of July? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 218 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did General Nhlemeza know about the letter that you 
had received asking for a meeting or had he been sent his own copy? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I presume he would have 
received his own copy of the letter I received was via Advocate Riso 
was the prosecutor in the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the letter itself, did mention that General 
Nhlemeza was meant to attend as well? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair, it may assist if I could take 
10 
you to the letter to the evidence of Mr Roelofse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no actually I think the answer is at paragraph 
205. It says the letter was also addressed to General Nhlemeza. So, he 
would have known from the letter. He got his own, I think. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What transpired at this meeting with 
General Nhlemeza on this 13 t h of July 2015? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, in short… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just confirm first. Who was at the meeting? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was General Nhlemeza, General 
Mononopi, Brigadier Moodley, myself and then I think it was the staff 
officer of General Nhlemeza but I’m not sure. I didn’t know him at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what happened at the meeting? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 219 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  General Nhlemeza instructed me 
not to investigate the matter any further and because the matter was 
struck off the roll of the Court roll. I understood the matter to mean the 
CI criminal investigations which included the original Mdluli/Barnard 
criminal matter. General Nhlemeza instructed me not to engage with the 
NPA on the matter. General Nhlemeza appointed Brigadier Moodley as 
the chief investigating officer for the matter. I am instructed to stop the 
investigation. General Nhlemeza informed me that he will attend the 
meeting at 14h00 later that day alone and General Nhlemeza tried to 
intimidate me by asking, by raising a lunch that I supposedly had with 
10 
General Jacobs that needed to be investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the context of that intimidation you talk 
about? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, he was not speaking 
directly to me. He was speaking to General Mononopi addressing her 
butt speaking about me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He wanted you to hear but talking to her? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He wanted me to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, he was asking her how far is 
20 
that investigation with regards to myself and General Jacobs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  And from the gist of what he is 
trying to ask from her, what he’s asking her is that we apparently had 
lunch together and. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 220 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would it be a problem to have lunch with General 
Jacobs or Jacobs? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chairperson, welcome to the 
twilight zone. I really do not know. That’s what I asked as well. I said I 
did not have lunch but if I had what would have been the, where is the 
wrongdoing in that? What did I do wrong? I never got an answer. I do 
not know whether investigation was done or not but I think that was 
said for my benefit. So, that the context of that comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, so now for the first time you are getting a clear 
instruction from him that you should stop this investigation. You should 
10 
not continue with this investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And but on the basis of what he said at the meeting is 
not as if he was saying the investigation must not be continued. He just 
wanted somebody else to conduct the investigation and not you. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, again that was for 
appearance sake because later on I deal with that. But again, Brigadier 
Moodley was transferred probably a month after that and no one else 
was given the authority or was asked to continue with the investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so but you say as at that meeting you had the 
20 
suspicion that putting Brigadier Moodley into the investigation wasn’t 
meant in any serious way for purpose that he should pursue the 
investigation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just for appearance. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 221 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is what I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how you viewed it. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is how I viewed it. Chair, 
Brigadier Moodley was not, he knew about the facts of the case. He 
was not involved in the investigation. It was a massive investigation. 
You don’t just give that from one person to another without proper 
handover and explanation. I would have been probably busy with the 
case for the next six months just to handed over to Brigadier Moodley. 
That’s why I knew it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not meant in a serious way. 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  It was not meant in a serious way. 
I did not expect that he would transfer Brigadier Moodley but that 
indeed happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he say at this meeting why he was, he didn’t want 
you to be the one continuing with investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. He didn’t give me any 
reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, what would have been the 
point? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He wouldn’t have given me even if 
he had given me an answer, I wouldn’t know whether that’s an honest 
answer or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Apart from what you have put here as what 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 222 of 233 
 
transpired, was there any other, were there any other things that were 
discussed at this meeting or was the meeting just for purposes of him 
telling you this? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, that is what I suspect. 
There was not much discussed after this but what actually, what was 
very, what was very worrying to me is the fact that General Mononopi 
whom we briefed and who expressed an opinion regarding this that she 
didn’t do anything to intervene. I understand Brigadier Moodley’s 
position because he was in the same situation as I am. He was also set 
aside and not listened to. So, I was actually, I was very, I was 
10 
perturbed by her, by the fact that she did not even mention the fact that 
this is wrong you can’t do this. She didn’t say a word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, was Brigadier Moodley a lady, a woman? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Brigadier Moodley was also a 
man. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m talking about Major General 
Mononopi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Mononopi because she was the head of your unit 
now? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and at the first meeting that you had had with 
her where you briefed her about this investigation, she had appeared to 
be interested in assisting. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. I had the 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 223 of 233 
 
impression that she was genuinely shocked when hearing the extent of 
this and that she wanted to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So, nobody else said anything of substance 
really other than what General Nhlemeza said. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Ja, Chair it wasn’t a discussion 
about it was just given this is what I’m saying and this is what you’re 
going to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, there wasn’t actually a 
discussion that took place. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. So, and he didn’t say why he was going to be the 
only one attending the 2 o’clock meeting with the NPA on the matter 
when one you were the one who had been investigating the matter. But 
even if you are not supposed to attend that meeting now because you 
were off the case. Then Brigadier Moodley who was going to investigate 
the matter why he was not going to be taken along. He didn’t give you 
an explanation. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He didn’t give any reason; he also 
didn’t invite him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and he knew nothing about the case? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Brigadier Moodley… (intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or at least from what in terms of documents that you 
had. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That’s correct, Chair. He would 
have known from the case in terms of the memos and the feedback that 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 224 of 233 
 
I gave him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s all he would have known? Unless there was 
something that he had elsewhere. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. He didn’t 
have access to the actual docket. So, he didn’t read through the 
affidavit. He didn’t have that kind of access. He could have if he asked 
but he was the head and he dealt with his own issues as the head of 
the or the acting head of that unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course, as I recall now the letter from the NPA 
calling for this meeting its purpose was to discuss the issue of 
10 
declassification of documents. Isn’t it? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And without those documents being declassified the 
case could not proceed.   
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was against the, was he against the 
declassification in terms of what he had pronounced leaving out your 
own analysis of the situation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, he didn’t say anything. He 
didn’t pronounce on the declassification itself. He pronounced on the 
20 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That would include then the 
declassification. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 225 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, that is how I… That is what 
transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He stopped the investigation which 
then as far as I am concerned also stopped the declassification 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay yes continue. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I note the time but I’m guided by you 
Chair. I note the time but I’m guided by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Maybe let’s go to quarter to. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Roelofse, if I could ask you to 
turn to Annexure 47 which starts at page 433 please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  433. Is it correct that this is an email 
authored by yourself which you sent to Brigadier Moodley dated the 
15 t h of July 2015 at 17h38? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is the purpose of the email? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  To show that I am working 
overtime, Chair. The purpose of the email was to deal with the meeting 
20 
that transpired on the 13 t h. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so, this was then a recordal of 
your understanding as to the outcomes of the meeting that was had 
with General Nhlemeza and others? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 226 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Two days before. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In the middle of the page you inform 
or you record rather that the following instructions were issued 
regarding the above-mentioned investigations at the meeting with Major 
General Nhlemeza on 2015-07 at 11 o’clock. And in doing so, you then 
distinguished between two case numbers, sorry three case numbers. 
The first two is under one line first being Littleton case 432/011/2011 
and Vosloorus case 342/02/199. Which criminal investigations were 
these? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, the two that I mentioned on 
top are the ones that was already in court that proceeded in court. I 
think it is again my opinion regarding this. It would not have been, it 
would have been very suspicious if he then asked me to step down from 
these cases as well as it was already in court and we were leading 
evidence at the time on these specific matters. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so, you record it to be your 
understanding that you remain to be the investigating officer on these 
matters. Is that right? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is how I recorded it, yes 
20 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The next case number that you 
referenced there is Silverton case 155/07/2011. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which case is this? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 227 of 233 
 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  This is now the CI investigation, 
the one where which started with the BMW and then it included the 
other investigations that were supposed to be re-enrolled. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you turn the page at page 434 you 
make a few assertions. In the middle of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  434 which is the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you please read the full 
assertions that you make? 
10 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At the top of the page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell him exactly where. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So, it’s in the middle of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Starting with? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it starts with the words, I do not 
know what the intention is of such a threat. And the following word 
begins firstly. Following sentence, sorry begins with firstly. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Firstly, I did not have lunch with 
the individuals as mentioned. I think the last time I saw Major General 
Jacobs was about two years ago. Secondly, if I did see him and had 
20 
lunch with him what would be the transgression? Surely, the 
transgression cannot lie with whom I have lunch. Thirdly, if that is not a 
transgression, I would like to be advised of what I am accused of. In 
the same vein, I would expect that Major General Jacobs would be 
advised of same. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 228 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the last point? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I’m giving notice that I intend to 
take this matter further as it is the third incident I am being falsely 
accused of in less than four months. In this regard, I refer to the… 
(indistinct) saga and accusations that they illegally obtained classified 
information and is by definition illegally in possession thereof due to 
the fact that I did not have security clearance. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you in fact take this matter 
further as you recorded there? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, I gave it some thought and I 
10 
thought, I just came to the conclusion it’s not going to get anywhere. 
So, I didn’t take it any further. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER: 
 
And 
did 
you 
receive 
any 
correspondence to suggest that what you recorded in this email as your 
account of what transpired at the meeting was inaccurate in any way? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We can go back to page 61. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was Brigadier Moodley’s response if any at the 
meeting were General Nhlemeza said he was the one who should take 
over the investigation. Did he just keep quiet? Did he say okay? 
20 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Brigadier Moodley I think the 
circumstances didn’t allow him to say, to say much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say anything, ja. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Or to say anything. I cannot even 
remember if he did say anything. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 229 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, I cannot remember offhand 
what was said by him if indeed he did say anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between that date and the date when he was 
transferred, did he ask for a meeting to discuss the handover of the 
investigation to him? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair because I know that he 
was also, he also knew that he was not investigating officer. He was 
never intended to be the investigating officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, your assessment is that both you and he were of 
10 
the same view that General Nhlemeza was not serious in saying that 
you should take over the investigation? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Is there anything that Brigadier Moodley said to 
you which made you think that? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Chair, we would have discussed it 
afterwards because he would have asked me. He did ask me actually 
for the classified documents and he said to me that’s the only thing that 
he can do is to hold on the classified, hold onto the classified 
documents that needs to be declassified. And we put that, we placed 
20 
that 
into 
his 
safe. 
So, 
that 
was 
the 
extent 
of 
what 
he. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He did because nothing else is 
going to, was going to happen with regard to the instruction by General 
Nhlemeza. 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 230 of 233 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I just like to refer to one point 
which I actually forgot, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  Which I address in this email. 
Something that General Nhlemeza said. He stated in, he stated during 
the meeting Major General and this is now my quote from this. Major 
General Nhlemeza would meet the NDPP alone on 2015-07-13. Major 
General Nhlemeza will inform the NDPP to appoint new prosecutors in 
this matter. So, that was the extent in terms of what he was going to do 
10 
at the meeting with the NDPP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I may have missed that. What did you say 
he was going to do at the meeting? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  He said he is going to say to the, 
informed the NDPP, not ask, informed the NDPP to appoint new 
prosecutors in this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, did he say why he would do that? What was 
wrong with the prosecutor who was involved and where did he come in 
on the selection of prosecutors? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  I do not know, Chair. That was his 
20 
comment and it wasn’t just one prosecutor. At that point in time there 
was two prosecutors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That worked extensively on the 
matter that has drawn up a comprehensive charge sheet and that knew

the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, one he didn’t want to you to continue with the 
investigation yet you had been involved in the investigation for years? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now he didn’t want prosecutors on the matter who 
had been involved in the matter for years? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  At point in time probably a year, 
yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, for quite some time. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That’s correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might not because the investigation would have 
preceded the matter going to the prosecutors. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  That’s correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but he didn’t want them from what he said? 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  No, Chair. I do not know why 
because he hasn’t met them before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR KOBUS DEMEYER ROELOFSE:  So, I would know why he want to 
make that comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.

ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Guided by you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at quarter to. I think we will stop now. We are 
left with about, what? 13 pages. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, it’s about 11 pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 11 pages? 
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 232 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the pace at which we have been going is such 
that maybe it would be unrealistic to think we can do 10 pages in two or 
three hours because today we did about 13 pages. We started at 47 is 
it? Page 47. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, Chair. The progression has been 
different on the different days since we started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I’m wondering, no I’m not blaming anybody. 
I’m talking about our pace all of us and probably I should exclude the 
witness. He has no control on who asked him questions when and how 
10 
many questions. But I would really prefer us to finish the evidence of 
this witness rather than break it up. But maybe I think we must continue 
tomorrow but it would be on the understanding that if at all possible, I 
hope we can try and finish within two hours. But what I’m thinking is 
that if you can this evening look very closely to the remaining pages 
and the Annexures that may need to be referred to. Maybe there might 
be a way of selecting the important things without doing any injustice to 
the case, to the evidence. And then let’s see whether we can finish 
within a short time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe we could start at 09h30. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 10h30. I don’t know if there is a chance of 
finishing at 11 but I’m very poor when it comes to estimating time. So, I 
don’t trust my estimates very much.  
19 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 167 
 
Page 233 of 233 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I’m guided by you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, I think let’s start at 09h30. Hopefully we will 
finish about 11 or at the very latest 12 or 11h30. Ja, two hours to 
11h30. But I think there might be a chance if you look carefully at the 
remaining pages of the statement and identify really important things 
otherwise other things one can read later because he has confirmed 
that what he says in the statement is correct. And the Annexures on the 
Annexures except those were reading them is quite important because 
of the importance of the contents. Otherwise he could just give the gist 
of what each Annexure says without reading it. So, maybe we could try 
10 
that. Okay we are going to adjourn Mr Roelofse. We will start at 09h30 
tomorrow. Hopefully we can finish within two hours or so. Okay we 
adjourned for the day. We adjourn.
