ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I just would like my colleagues from 
Bloemfontein to put on record advise you as to what they have been 
able to do. 
10

ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If that is in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Document yes let us do it ja. 
MR JACOBS:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
MR JACOBS:  Chair I would just like to place it on record Chair will 
remember yesterday there was a request or a discussion with regard to 
the affidavit.

MR JACOBS:  The unsigned affidavit I can put on record is in line with 
20 
the signed one that is in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JACOBS:  Do you also remember that there was a request with 
regards to the annexures and the readability thereof Chair.  We have 
gone through an effort I will not go into detail but we can – the

Page 3 of 187 
 
annexures that is attached to that affidavit is visually in a better form 
now and can be read and we have handed over such to my learned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much that is very good I really 
appreciate that. 
MR JACOBS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you ready to proceed? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes I am Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Thabethe the oath you took yesterday continues to 
10 
apply until you have finished your evidence okay? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Thabethe when we were having our 
hearing yesterday we were discussing Paras.  I indicated to you that I 
have a real interest in how Paras got involved with the Department.  In 
your memorandum you had indicated the memorandum to the Free 
State Premier you had motivated to go to India.  We discussed that in 
quite a bit of detail but there are one or two other aspects related to 
that memorandum and I would like to explore with you.  One of the first 
20 
ones – in fact what I think I should do is just to very briefly summarise 
where I think more or less we were on the issues relating to Paras.  So 
we had dealt with Mr Narayan’s travel expenses being paid for by the 
Department, yes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 4 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then in the evidence you gave yesterday 
we also established that Mr Narayan as at the 28 February 2012 had 
not been appointed to the Advisory Council of the Premier? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You also explained to the Chairman on the 
Chairman’s question really that in conceptualising the dairy farm 
project for the Free State your intention was to extend dairy farming to 
local communities, emerging farmers in the Free State who would then 
not only supply milk to the dairy but also be equity beneficiaries of this 
project, did – is that? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was that your evidence?  Excellent.  Part of 
the motivation you set out in that letter for identifying Paras as the 
ideal strategic partner was that – and correct me if I am wrong or if I 
misunderstood you, you liked their business model because they 
collected milk from community members and processed this milk in their 
own processing plant.  This is what attracted you to them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And that is what your evidence was okay.  
Now two things I want to clarify with you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please Ms Gcabashe remind what page that document 
is? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  If you will just give me one – I do apologise 
Chairman.  Chairman I found quite a few clear copies of the same 
documentation in the Court Record. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 5 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So I know I am complicating your life. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are looking for those ones ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But if I might ask you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To look at the Court Records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The – Chairman we will be back with you in a 
minute with that particular page reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
10 
ADV 
LEAH 
GCABASHE: 
 
But 
the 
context 
is 
that 
particular 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That had the million millions on it.  That is the 
one we looking for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So in that memorandum you – you had set out 
a particular motivation but I would like to take you to paragraph 40 of 
your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Ms Gcabashe you can tell me the page of the 
20 
one that was not so clear that we were using yesterday if that is 
easier?  I can use it for – so – until we get the clearer copy where it is. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  1323 File D – Reference File D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reference Pile – File B? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  D – D for Donald. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 6 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  D for Donald.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is the page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  1323. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   13? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Yes, no I found it that is the one that 
has got R1 000 000 000,00. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Indeed so Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I would at the same time ask you while you 
hold onto page 1323 of Reference Bundle B to also pull out your 
witness bundle HH10 which has your affidavits.  Your bundle – yes. 
Which we call the witness bundle yes.  If you could please go to page 
109 we are looking at paragraph 40 of that document.  Chairman if you 
want to look at the clearer copy that has been put right at the end of 
your file it is paragraph 40 that we will be looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It has the number at the top MPT – reference 
MPT109 right on the top right hand side if you have the same document 
20 
I have Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I – I thought the document you are 
referring to was the affidavit of which I now have a clearer copy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is indeed that one Chairman.  So if you just 
go to paragraph 40 of that we are on the same… 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 7 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I went there but I did not see the heading that you are 
talking about that is what confused me. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  My apologies Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page – I am looking at 40. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  40 that paragraph.  And it starts off with the 
goal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it.  It start with the goal was… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So Mr Thabethe you have noted in this 2018 
10 
affidavit that – and this is what you have written: 
“The goal was to procure and establish a dairy farm 
for the production of milk to set up milk production – 
I beg your pardon – milk procurement centres at 
which local farmers could sell and supply their milk 
and to set up a production and processing facility 
where the milk could be processed, marketed and 
sold.” 
You have seen that paragraph? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now if we go back to page 1323 which was 
your memorandum you noted there in paragraph 2.2 that there were 
three dairy farms that you had envisaged setting up.  One in Vrede, one 
which you – would be called the Sesotho Integrated Project and the 
third one would be in QwaQwa, am I correct? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 8 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the question is, in respect of these three 
dairy farms had you intended having all three elements that you 
mention in paragraph 30 of your affidavit that is the production of milk, 
the establishment of a procurement centre and the production of a 
processing facility.  Is that what you had intended for the three dairy 
farms? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair originally when we – we 
allocated a budget of R17 million was to deal with the three dairies to 
assist the smallholder farmers.  That was only to assist them on a 
10 
smallholder dairy farmers.  Now having learnt that small dairies were 
not successful we – as we proceeded we then changed the idea.   We 
did not close them down but we changed the idea of not only supporting 
the smallholder farmers to establish dairies.  That was originally what 
the money was intended for.  But then we came with an idea of not only 
helping dairy but also to do processing and procurement which meant 
that we looked for a bigger option.  Keeping in mind that we had three 
areas that we needed to support. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can I – if the Chairman will allow me to 
interrupt you?  Maybe I should make my question clearer.  I am simple 
20 
interpreting what is written in this letter and I do not want you to run 
too far ahead in terms of the developments that took place at whatever 
phase and point in time.  I am really here at the date on which you 
made the submission which was the 24 February. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 9 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As at that point in time you had three dairy 
projects in mind. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And the question was for all three had you 
intended to establish not just a procurement centre and processing 
facility but also you were going to make sure that they would have – 
have milk produced at the centre.  So you had three elements that you 
had pointed to in your affidavit. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The plan was not to do the same thing 
in all three. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ah that helps.  But the plan when you 
submitted this document. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was to have three. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The budget that existed was for three. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  Because I want to be sure that the R17 
million for the three dairy plans I want to understand that the plans 
would be similar or would the plans be different plans? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No they will be different Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you will later point us to whatever 
20 
document you have supporting what you are saying about three 
different plans.  When we get there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You see because we debated the R17 million 
the cost of R17 million yesterday which was money that had been 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 10 of 187 
 
allocated for three dairy plans.  Just again interpreting what you said to 
the Premier when you submitted this document. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja I just want to understand what the Premier 
understood you to be requesting from him. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja.  We also yesterday discussed what I 
called putting the cart before the horse.  So what I was expressing 
yesterday was that there ought really to have been a pre-feasibility 
study before you went off trying to put together a dairy farm and you 
10 
disagreed with me and said there was no need for a pre-feasibility 
study before you spent R17 million on plans and more money on other 
things.  Did I – are you with me?  I am not misinterpreting what you 
said yesterday? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No maybe let me repeat.  I am – my 
understanding was the issue of when – what we were discussing was 
the issue of spending the money before the feasibility study. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then my argument was that to do the 
feasibility study you need the money. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And what I had proposed to you was before 
you even start allocating money you really need to have gone through 
an exercise where you decide on whether you will have the money, 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 11 of 187 
 
whether you have chosen the right idea etcetera, etcetera and I just 
thought of a better term overnight.  And one could call that a pre-
feasibility study.  I understand that you did do a feasibility study so I 
am not contesting that.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The idea I was putting to you was that of 
doing some kind of check on whether this really was the root you 
wanted to go.  A less expensive way of spending government money.  
That is – so I am simply tidying up the language I used yesterday in 
saying my proposal was about a pre-feasibility study which I would 
10 
have thought would be less costly. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is true Chair and that is exactly 
the process we followed as you can check in the document there are 
two feasibility studies. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We will get to them.  They are – we will get 
there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then again still staying with this particular 
visit you lodged this motivation with the Premier on the 24 February 
2012.  I am simply looking at when you signed the document.  So that 
20 
is when you would have given it to the Premier. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now at that stage that is prior to getting 
permission from the Premier to go on that trip to India had you been in 
contact with Paras? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 12 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When did you first start contacting Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If I – I may not remember exactly but 
it was around December when I started interacting with Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is December which year?  2011? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  2011. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you arrive in the Department in August of 
2011.  We know that MEC Zwane mentioned this project to Mr Roy 
Jankielsohn somewhere around November – October/November 2011.  
In December you contact Paras.  You of course had conducted your 
10 
desktop study. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you then contact Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who suggested that you should contact Paras 
at that point in time? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was my initiative Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Did you telephone them, did you email them, 
what did you do as you contacted them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I called Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Where did you get the telephone numbers 
from? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair in their website they have the 
telephone numbers. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who in Paras were you able to contact the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 13 of 187 
 
first time you made contact? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I contacted their office which was in 
New Delhi.  That – then I requested to talk to somebody who could 
assist me with regard to their business. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You did not think it prudent to use the South 
African High Commission to try and contact Paras or to assist you?  
You are a man of protocol.  You did not try using the South African High 
Commission? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair you do use them when – when 
you already know what you want to do so that you provide them the 
10 
information of what you want to do.  Because you need to clear the 
business that you interested in before you contact the High 
Commission. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So when you contacted Paras what idea did 
you have in mind at the time?  Because it was before the 24 February 
so you were not looking for a strategic partner I see that in the letter of 
the 24 t h.  What did you have in mind when you contacted them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Clearly what I wanted to do was to 
visit and go and see their operations. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So by December you had taken a decision to 
20 
go and visit Paras and look at the facilities? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The – my contact was to find out 
whether they would agree there would be possibilities of allowing us to 
come and have – and see their operations. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you recall who then gave you a response 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 14 of 187 
 
as you – who did you speak to telephonically and who responded to 
your enquiry? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I think in the documents eventually 
when I called … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No I do not want eventually I am still talking 
about that first call.  I really do not want to get this mixed up.  When 
you first called that is what we are talking about. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I called the number it went into 
their office and then I then requested somebody that I could talk to who 
could assist us with the operations that they are having in terms of a 
10 
dairy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who did you say you were when you called? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I had explained myself that I am 
calling from South Africa as a head of a Provincial Government 
Department of Agriculture so I explained myself who I was and then I 
then requested to talk to somebody there who could assist. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And what the response continue you were 
explaining? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They actually gave me the name of a 
person who could assist. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Give us that name please Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The person that – who was the head 
of the office was also indicated I think it was – let me just check the 
correct name from my affidavit?  My apology Chair for delaying I did not 
anticipate. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 15 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  No, no you can look for the name. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe can – might decide that to move on to 
other things then during the tea break you might look at it more if her 
plans in terms of her questions permit that.  But – have you found it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hey no no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not yet. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I know that the one name I have come across 
10 
is that of Mr Gajiender Kumar. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Kumar yes that is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Would that – that is the one name I have 
come across. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes that is the correct – that is 
correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja. Is that the person you contacted? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That was the person I was told he 
was the head of the office at that time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay.  When was the next time you talked – 
20 
and you spoke to him on that day? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I was able to talk to him on that day. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And he was positive in his response? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  He was very positive.  He welcomed 
us to come and see.  We spoke about quite a number of things of which 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 16 of 187 
 
some of them he was highlighting that a lot of people come and visit 
their factories, steal ideas and all those kinds of things.  Those were 
the things that he was saying.  He was wary about just to permit people 
but he does not have any problem to people coming to see and discuss 
with him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Let us continue.  Now you then had to make 
preparations to go to India I presume? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair I – after I have spoken to 
him that was not the only time I had spoken to him that was the first 
time I had spoken to him.  After the December holiday I also spoke to 
10 
him late January giving an indication that we would then confirm that 
we would want to come,.  We would inform him as soon as we get the 
necessary approval that we will be coming. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay.  You then prepared the motivation for 
the Premier whose response you received on the 28 February? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And again just for my own understanding in 
your mind what you wanted to do was go and do some form of due 
diligence inspection of these people who you were interested in, their 
company? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Their company yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Because I know there are legal and 
commercial due diligence exercises.  Is that what you had in mind? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You then get a response on the 29 t h but you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 17 of 187 
 
fly on the – I beg your pardon on the 28 t h and by the 29 t h you have a 
ticket and Mr Narayan has a ticket to fly to New Delhi.  How did you 
manage to arrange for that trip in such a short space of time?  Your 
approval you get on the 28 t h, you leave the very next day on the 29 t h.  
Just help us understand who was this efficient in making sure you could 
leave on the 29 t h? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair if you look at the memorandum 
there had been some time that I had submitted it.  Now you – knowing 
that you had dates that you have recommended you would not sit back 
and say because I did not have a response therefore I am not making 
10 
the necessary arrangement.  So you do the necessary arrangement in 
case you receive the approval.  Because those dates we agreed with 
the people that we are visiting.  If not then you will then have to 
renegotiate new dates.  So those approval – those arrangements you 
make ahead so that if you get the approval the last day of your 
departure you are ready to be able to go. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So you - you do those arrangements 
ahead of time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you had purchased your tickets already 
20 
by the 29 t h - by the 28 t h - let me just go a day back - when the premier 
gave his approval? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it is not the purchase Chair.  It is 
- it is a - what is the correct word? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  A reservation? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 18 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a reservation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You reserved seats? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  You - you talk to the travel 
agent.  They reserve those seats for you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Those particular details Chairman are on 
page 1-3-2-5 of the document that we are looking at.  What is of 
interest Mr Thabethe …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sorry Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What is of interest …? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  1-3-2-5.  So it is the same memorandum.  
You are quite correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The same memorandum which was on the 
reference bundle.  Mr Thabethe are you there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You found the … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I have … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Flight details. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the - you see because it is dated 
24 February but again so these are quotes that you have received … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For these flights?  What I noticed was you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 19 of 187 
 
left on 29 February.  You arrived in New Delhi on 1 March the next day 
at 10 - in fact at 14:45.  At quarter to three in the afternoon.  So I 
presume you got to your hotel at about four/5 o’ clock. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On 1 March.  By 3 March - so one day 
passes.  That is probably the day you visited. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On 3 March at 11 o’ clock in the morning - 
10 to 11 you are leaving New Delhi. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What were you able to achieve in more or 
less the 24 hours you had in New Delhi Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair as - as I have indicated the - 
the purpose of the mission was as I have indicated to confirm that there 
- there is an existent the - of - of the company itself because if - if you 
on the web you may believe the company exists when it does not exist.  
It was for me to go there and confirm.  We had a meeting with them. 
They took me through their company, through a presentation.  
We visited the site and I confirmed the product that they were saying 
they were producing and a number of other issues that I was able to 
20 
say yes indeed this company exists and if they are in agreement with 
us we can do business with them.  That - that was the intention Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At what time did you arrive at the 
company’s offices on 2 March? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I do not remember Chair but it was 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 20 of 187 
 
in the same town. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You went there in the morning? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We went there in the morning.  We 
started in the office where we had discussions and then after that we 
then went to visit their factory. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now they have a number of what you are 
calling factories.  Now I am assuming that you are interested in 
processing plants. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They - they have a number of - of 
factories spread throughout. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please define a factory so we understand 
what we are talking about Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the processing plant is where 
they receive the milk where it is brought in by the tankers and then it 
goes through all the processes until whether they make cheese or they 
make yoghurt whatever that they want to make.  So that is the 
processing facility we visited. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you went to that particular processing 
facility that is in - you say - in New Delhi? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  In - it was in New Delhi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well she had asked you to tell her more about the 
factory.  Is that what you were referring to when you said you went to 
their factory? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  It - it - Chair it - it is - I will 
alternatively use a factory or a processing plant. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 21 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It refers to the same … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no she just wanted to be sure that she 
understands what you are talking about when you say factory. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And was it Mr Kumar himself who took you 
on this tour of the facility? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who formed part of his delegation when 
10 
you met him? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - he had a team of people that we 
sat with in the office and then when we went on site it was only him and 
another gentleman. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You - you - if you have the names 
Mr Thabethe it is useful for you to mention the names of the other 
gentlemen or ladies who were party to what you were trying to achieve.  
It just helps.  Do you know who he was with because we know that you 
were with Mr Narayan? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They introduced themselves to us but 
20 
I cannot remember now Chair but they introduced themselves to us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It would also be useful if one understood 
at what level of seniority you were - you were dealing in this place at 
this point in time.  That you were not talking to somebody who did not 
have authority to engage you on the issues you were interested in. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 22 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair our understanding was that the 
person that we were dealing with was the head of the office. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As in the CEO? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As in the CEO and that - that is how 
also I had addressed him when I also sent letters to him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you were able to get the attention of 
the CEO of Paras even though he did not know you.  You had not met 
him before obviously? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  I - I had managed to get CEO in 
a number of times on a call.  If they are willing to talk to you they will 
10 
talk to you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did Mr Narayan have any contribution to 
make to ensuring that you were able to get hold of the CEO and get 
consultation or discussion going with the CEO? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chairperson that - that happened 
later but from the beginning I had done it myself and I was - I was very 
fortunate that he had a certain level.  All - although his English was not 
very good but he was able to talk English. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What value add did Mr Narayan bring to 
what you have just set out for us arranging the meetings, being able to 
20 
talk to Mr Kumar? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the language issue was - was 
very key because when you get there to be able to clarify some of 
these things properly you need somebody who understands the 
language.  So he was of very big assistance even when we were in the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 23 of 187 
 
meeting.  Some of the people that were making presentations they did 
the presentation in their local language because they were not able to 
speak English. 
So he then assisted in translating from the local language to 
English for my understanding. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How many presentations were made to 
you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They - they made one presentation 
and the other presentation was made when we were in tour just 
explaining to us what was happening. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that the presentation that you - you 
brought back to South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is the document that is in that bundle I 
think if you look at page 2-0-6 at Annexure FR14.  There is a document 
there that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What is the EXHIBIT number? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is HH10 your witness bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay and page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  HH10, page 2-0-6 Chair.  We will have 
20 
better copies hopefully Chair by lunchtime but I only want you to 
confirm whether this is one of the presentations that was made to you 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because you annexed it to your papers. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 24 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was hoping by tea break. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Possibly Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  2-0-6 you said? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  2-0-6.  It is really just the front page of a 
presentation but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And this is why I just wanted to establish 
whether this is one of the presentations.  Had you taken a presentation 
across to Paras? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No we did not.  We - we were in a fact 
finding mission.  So we - we went to expose ourselves to what they 
had. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then in relation to your fact finding 
mission you say they took you through the company’s books etcetera.  I 
presume these were written in the English language? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes it was Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you were able to sit down and go 
through their structure whether they are liquid etcetera? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  How much time did you spend doing that?  
That would normally be your due diligence exercise just to make sure 
these people actually are who they say they are as you - as you have 
indicated. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we started there Chair in the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 25 of 187 
 
morning and they - they took us through the company, the presentation.  
Then immediately after that we - we went on site.  My - my big interest 
was to understand how they operate if they are there and also to go to 
the site so that I have exposure to the site where they are doing the 
processing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now you also - the way you put it in your 
affidavit - this is the 2018 affidavit which is in HH10 at page 2-3-8.  You 
say that you brought back your presentation.  I just want to understand 
what you mean by that.  So you will find that in paragraph 10.  It is the 
last sentence of paragraph 10. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sorry Chair.  2-3-8? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes but that of course is the copy that is 
not very clear.  If you want to look at a clear copy simply go to 
paragraph 10 of that particular document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now.  That is not in EXHIBIT HH10.  Is it? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman so your clear copy was put - I 
would like to think at the - right at the end of your file.  It is the only 
additional document that has been put into your HH10 because … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is a clear copy of what I am reading.  I 
beg your pardon Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My error. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 26 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is actually 2017 affidavit that I am 
looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the new one?  The clear copy? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the affidavit which has a clear copy? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is a clear copy Chairman but it has 
always been in your file.  So there are three affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is was the last one - the 2017. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think I have got it.  2-3-8 you said - page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I have got it, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And it is paragraph 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My error was in calling it the 2018 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Affidavit Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is the 2017 one.  So that last sentence 
20 
is rather ambiguous.  When I read it I thought that you had taken a 
presentation to India and you were now bringing back to South Africa 
your presentation. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sorry Chair.  What - what paragraph? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The last sentence of paragraph 10.  I am 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 27 of 187 
 
simply confirming Mr Thabethe that the presentation you brought back 
to South Africa … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was a presentation you received in … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  From there, yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is not one (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is your copy of the presentation they gave you? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They gave me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you have identified the document we 
were talking about a few minutes ago as the particular presentation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On your return to South Africa - so again 
we know that you - you had discussions with Mr Kumar.  You say that 
you prepared a report with recommendations on the dairy project 
20 
concept.  Did you do that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I did. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you prepared it for purposes of 
lodging that recommendation with the MEC? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair on my return I then did 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 28 of 187 
 
a submission to the Executive Council so that they can officially agree 
that we - we interact with - with the company.  Also to present my 
recommendations to them in terms of initiating this relationship. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You - you did no further work on this 
matter Mr Thabethe other than prepare this recommendation?  You did 
not sit down and - and assimilate and understand and check a few more 
things.  You simply prepared a recommendation on the strength of what 
you had heard and seen at Paras in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I do not understand the question. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will repeat it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the question is whether apart from the 
observations you had made when you went to visit Paras and apart 
from what you had been told there about their operation.  There was 
any further work you did before - when you arrived back before you 
prepared a submission for Exco. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  There - there was not any 
further work because any further work that I would do would not have 
been given a blessing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hence the first thing to do was to 
20 
request that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then you can proceed with any other 
work … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.1 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 29 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If you are given the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As the accounting officer had you taken a 
decision that Paras was the only company that you were going to do 
business with.  I am not talking about a blessing from anywhere else.  I 
am asking you as the accounting officer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I am interrogating why you as the 
accounting officer did not do further work after this preliminary visit to 
India to find out if you might not have other options within South Africa 
10 
or outside of South Africa. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair that work was done 
before I went to India.  You will remember that we had already done 
that assessment and we had already on - based on that assessment 
was to go and visit and confirm.  In my return that was confirmed.  So 
there would not be any reason to do another assessment after you have 
already done the assessment and you have picked what you thought 
would be feasible and you have visited and you have confirmed what 
you had checked before. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I would have thought Mr Thabethe that 
20 
having visited the facility you would want to just by way of example 
decide on whether you still wanted to have three dairy projects, three 
that were similar, slight different ones because you had now had an 
exposure to a company that did things in a manner - you say - you 
approved of and this is why I ask the question.  Did you not apply your 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 30 of 187 
 
mind a fresh? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that would not have assisted 
me to do before I have the blessing.  That exercise was actually done 
after I received the approval.  Hence a submission was also made to - 
to Treasury to reassess the budget because I had originally been 
allocated a budget for three projects.  Now I have an approval to do a 
bigger project of which then I can make a decision to say which one do 
I start with. 
So that was actually done after the approval was granted by 
the Executive Council. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Why was it necessary to go the Executive 
Council with this proposal? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it is - it is not only this 
proposal. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no.  Why was it necessary to go to the 
Executive Council on this proposal? 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe let me put the question differently. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why was it necessary for you to get Exco approval for 
this proposal whether you got it by going to council or not but why was 
20 
council - Exco approval necessary for this proposal? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair let me start by 
saying all projects gets approval from the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When did you make that submission to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 31 of 187 
 
Exco - the date? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I need also to go into my 
document so that I can check … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The date? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The date … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Of - of the submission Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman will you allow me to be of 
assistance by rephrasing the question … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just to cut it shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that the proposal you took to Exco 
when Exco in return then gave you the resolution of 13 June?  No.  The 
resolution of 13 June is - is a - in all your court papers.  I can find it.  I 
am just trying to help you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To remember the … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Te date. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The date. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe - maybe remind him what the resolution of 
13 June says. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The resolution of 13 June says that you 
can implement the project.  It also says that more money must be found 
to support the project.  That is the resolution that - that came from 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 32 of 187 
 
Exco on 13 June 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that help to you remember when you might have 
made the presentation to Exco? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I - I remember that one 
but there were - there were other presentations that I did before that 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Soon after I returned from India … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then I made a presentation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And then the one that is in - she is 
referring to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Was the one where I - I was already 
indicating that this project that I am doing does not have enough 
money.  I request that I be assisted otherwise if I will not be able to get 
additional funding it may not be possible for me to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I have the document here if it 
makes sense.  Just at least to give you the page reference number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Reference Bundle A page 3-2-3. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Reference Bundle A. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 33 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Reference Bundle A page 3-2-3 and I am - 
I am just asking you to confirm that this is not the product of your 
reporting back to Exco. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  This is not the first 
presentation but it is one of the presentations I have made. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
So 
when 
Exco 
approved 
your 
recommendation did they take a resolution of any kind? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would - and you cannot remember when?  
I have not seen that resolution in any of your court papers. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I had Chair a number of these 
resolutions.  This was not the only resolution that was taken.  There 
was a number of them if I am not mistaken.  There could be about three 
or four of them.  I am not certain now but there was a number of them 
in - in the documents of the department that Exco had resolved 
because this project had been discussed quite a number of times and a 
number of resolutions were taken. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us go past the resolutions and take 
your word for it that you did make the presentation and that the 
legislature resolved or rather - I beg your pardon - Exco resolved that 
20 
you could go ahead.  That is what they resolved? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You then invited Mr Kumar to visit South 
Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 34 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we go there Ms Gcabashe.  Let us - I 
just want to go back - no leave it here for now - to your visit to Paras.  
You said yesterday that the key thing that really attracted you to Paras 
was their collection of milk from small farmers.  Is that correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you were in India what did you find was 
special that they were doing about collection of milk from small fryer - 
farmers that really you needed to - to know that they were doing?  You 
see when say the collection of milk from farmers I do not see what is 
special about that but maybe that is because I am not an agriculturist. 
10 
If you do research and find that a certain company collects 
milk from small farmers and you are in the Free State.  I would imagine 
that all you - you need is oh that might be a good idea.  So let us look 
at how we could do that here if it would be viable to do it.  I am not 
sure that that is something really that should be key to any - anything. 
Are you able to help me understand that?  I mean you have 
small farmers in Thembalihle or Thembalihle or wherever and you would 
have the dairy - the dairy farm somewhere.  If you decide that it would 
be viable that the farm should collect milk from farmers either you are 
going to send a truck or a car or whatever to go and collect - collect it 
20 
or you will say to the farmers you bring the - your milk to the farms.  So 
I am not sure that I understand why that would really be key. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Thank - thank you Chair.  The 
model that they have been using it is - it is not only collecting the milk 
but the support systems also that goes to the farmers because they 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 35 of 187 
 
would recommend to the farmers the - the quality of the milk to be at a 
certain level for higher butter fat content.  This is how you need to feed 
them.  This is how you need to manage. 
So they are over and above collecting the meat.  They have 
extended the support system to the farm.  They will have their own 
veterinarians going there assisting them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry.  I have also understood you to be 
saying - to be talking about collecting the milk … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just heard now as if you are saying meat. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No.  My apologies sir.  It is milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Milk? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Meat? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay milk? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is milk Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Let us … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  The - the support system - what 
was very interesting is the support system also.  So that they do not 
20 
just deliver milk.  It is quality milk that they are going to be getting 
from them.  So you - you - they also assist them because the - the dairy 
cattle (indistinct) they will then be able to assist them in - in the 
breeding of this cattle so that - assist them with the process of artificial 
insemination so that you also select the best of the best in terms of 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 36 of 187 
 
milk production. 
So that your herd that produces milk for you becomes top 
animals.  So it was not only coming to say do you have milk or you do 
not have milk but to set up a system that makes sure that you do very 
well and you are producing high quality milk because for processing 
purposes you do need that milk and you need your hygiene system to 
be - to be very high because milk in terms of hygiene if you do not keep 
those standards of hygiene your milk gets rejected in terms of the 
bacteria content.  So those are the support systems that were also, so I 
saw that they were very good, that interaction with the farmer, not only 
10 
going there, their own words will then go to the farmers, make 
recommendations to them how to improve their systems on their farm 
so that they have good quality milk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I still do not see why you need to go and – go 
to India for that, that should be key, because if you are going to 
establish a project which will require somebody else to supply you with 
a certain product obviously you must have your requirements as to what 
requirements must the product meet, in order for it to be acceptable to 
you, so you might say well the quality of the milk in the case of a dairy, 
milk that you are going to collect from the small farmers these are the 
20 
requirements, and if they have difficulty in meeting those requirements 
in a private sector situation you might not have any interest in helping 
them, you say I will only deal  with those who meet my requirements, 
that is how business operates, those who cannot meet my requirements 
I will not have anything to do with that, but in this case because you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 37 of 187 
 
are government and you want to assist the small farmers you might 
then say well what we will need to do is see how we can assist the 
small farmers to give this farm quality milk, that part I understand, but 
it seems to me that all you need really is people who know what 
advices should be given, who would know what needs to be done for 
small farmers to provide quality milk.  I am just not sure that I see this 
spatial key thing that I think you had in mind Paras would be  having 
about the collection of milk and I am trying to understand it and put 
myself in your position. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, thank you Chair.  What the Chair 
10 
is explaining is exactly what we intended to do, Chair I had indicated 
that we had started in the country to explore that idea, because our 
main idea is to support these farmers that we know they are going to 
meet those standards, and we have to support them, we have to 
develop them and make the money available for them to be able to get 
to that standard.   
 
Now if we do invitation locally to say this is what we want to 
do and you are not getting the support, because the standard of the 
supply of the milk are there, in the country, this is how you have to 
deliver the milk for it to be consumed.   It is there and these farmers 
20 
are struggling to do so, so we come in and we want to say, we want to 
assist them, can anybody who want to work with us join us in doing so, 
and you do not get that locally.  Then you begin to look somewhere else 
and say where else can I get help to assist our own farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well part of what you have said might be helpful in 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 38 of 187 
 
the sense that I think you say in terms of what the requirements would 
be for the milk to be of the relevant level of quality, that you knew, you 
knew what is required. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what you needed is somebody who would assist 
in helping the small farmers to do what is necessary in order for their 
milk to be at the right level of quality, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now is my understanding correct that you say 
you did approach various entities or organisations or companies within 
10 
the country to say we would like to help as the Provincial Government, 
or as the department to help small farmers here in the Free State or in 
Vrede to do what is necessary in order for them to produce quality milk. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say nobody was interested? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are the entities that you approached? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair we have organised meeting 
with a number of them, if I can mention we had discussions with Nestle, 
we had discussions with Parmalat, we had discussions with Clover and 
20 
if I am not mistaken we had discussions with Dairy Belle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were not prepared to assist in your efforts to 
effectively help the small farmers to produce quality milk, they were not 
prepared to be involved in such a project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   They did not indicate interest Chair 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 39 of 187 
 
to work with us in that project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you write to them or did you speak to them or 
both? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   We spoke to them Chair, we invited 
them, Chair will remember we have indicated that we did a lot of 
consultation before on these projects and to the legislature, to a lot of 
other people, inviting and calling them to participate and work with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that – and around when was that in relation to 
your trip to India, was it before or after, I guess it was before. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It was before Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to give some estimate, it must have 
been 2011 I guess? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I think – it was 2011 Chair, the 
process I think we did for two months consultation, I think it ended 
somewhere mid December, when we had started in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what reasons did they give, if they gave any 
reasons, for not being prepared to partner with the Provincial 
Government to assist small farmers? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair what we had been doing was in 
kind invitation to them, to join us, because we had already realised that 
20 
some of them were collecting milk in the Free State and if I am not 
mistaken there were specific farmers that they had signed contract with 
and very few of them were small farmers, and the few that I had 
mentioned which were in Qwa-Qwa which were also in the other place 
is in the Harrismith area, they had signed contracts, we had assisted 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 40 of 187 
 
those small farmers to get to a certain level on their farms of their 
small diaries, but those farmers were complaining that they were not 
making money because of the transport issue, so their main interest 
was to collect the milk, that is what we picked up and the development 
part of it became a problem, because we did not want only them to 
collect the milk but also to participate in developing these small 
farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one of the things you said you found Paras did 
was to send their own vet to the small farmers in India, they would send 
their own vet. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, they had a technical team which 
included vets, there are those that will also assist them with their 
grazing pastures, so they had a team that will then visit them and 
assist them with the technical knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just difficult for me to understand that you would 
not be able to get people to assist with this kind of thing when so many 
people accept that there is a need for transformation in various sectors 
and there is a need to contribute and so on, that is part of my difficulty 
but your evidence is you tried, nobody showed interest? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair we have tried not only in 
20 
the dairy industry but also in other aspects of agriculture, we did find it 
very difficult, hence in developing these farmers at certain stage you 
can help them to produce but they may not have a market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you tell them that the you know there would 
be money for them if they came on board, they will get money as well? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 41 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   We did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were not interested? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   They did not indicate any interest 
Chair.  Like I say Chair not only in the dairy also government has 
money to assist smallholder farmers, but you struggle with your money, 
you give them the land ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You say I have got money, I will give you money, I am 
not asking you to do this for free, they still are not interested? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is the problem, you buy, we 
have been assisting farmers with farms, we have the money to assist 
10 
them to develop hence the land that you give to the farmers the 
majority are in waste. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is just interesting you know somebody in South 
Africa is in business, you say I want to do business with you, you will 
get money from me, I am not asking you to do this for free, they are not 
interested, but somebody in India is interested.  Can you see that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair I must also mention we had 
good examples of cooperation between but there were pockets of them, 
where you get a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the country? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There are areas where you get a 
white commercial farmer with the knowledge assisting the neighbouring 
black farmers and we had been saying if we had issues like that we 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 42 of 187 
 
would then support financially so that those farmers develop, so you 
have pockets of these where you get that kind of support. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   And we are willing to make money - I 
am no longer ...[indistinct] we were willing to make money available to 
those systems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman can I just make one small 
addition to the questions you have been asking. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Mr Thabethe all the things you describe 
you say took place between August 2011 when you arrived, August 2011 
and December 2011, all these assessments of what people could do, 
could not do, what they were complaining about, what they were not 
complaining about, took place between August and December 2011? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair I did mention yesterday that 
some of the studies had been done before I arrived, they were already 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think you did make that point. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And you will be able to assist us get 
some proof of what you are talking about from the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I can – ja I can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess if you are given access? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chair the Department has been very 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 43 of 187 
 
helpful, so I think if Mr Thabethe just gives us an indication of where 
we will find the documents he is referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   I am sure Dr Masiteng, who is the current 
Acting Head, will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can appreciate, okay yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I must just correct the other 
place was not Harrismith, it was Ficksburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the one you were struggling to remember and 
mentioned Harrismith? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, now if you can request the 
Department to give you the study that was done between the 
Department and Germany on the Ficksburg proposal they will be able to 
give you a very comprehensive study that was done, which the 
Department has. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   We are going to ask them to give all of 
them to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might help if you are able to mention somebody 
who is still in the Department that would know the document that might 
help. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The current Acting HOD Dr Masiteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he knows about it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   He knows about it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 44 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, we will take ...[intervenes]  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I am limiting my interaction Chair 
with the Department because when I was suspended I was given strong 
conditions not to to talk to the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, that was of course when you were still in 
the employ of the Department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No, when I was suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well when you were suspended you were still in 
the employ of the Department isn’t it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t cease to be an employee of the 
Department when you were suspended isn’t it?   You only ceased to be 
an employ when your contract expired. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay, no that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay alright but I think the bottom line is 
that you are prepared to do whatever you may be permitted to do to 
assist to obtain the information. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay we will take the tea adjournment and we 
will resume at twenty five to twelve.   
20 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes thank you, we may proceed. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 45 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Now Mr Thabethe 
before I actually tidy up the visit of Mr Kumar can I just get a bit of 
context to your relationship or the reason that you – you approached 
Paras.  I am looking page 237 of HH10 which I your witness bundle.  It 
is the 2017 affidavit that you deposed to and I am looking at paragraph 
8.  So it is page 237 HH10 and paragraph 8 thereof.  Are you there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Here you speak of your analysis of India 
being identified as the highest milk producer and you talk about there 
being an existing bilateral agreement on agriculture between South 
10 
Africa and India.  Then you say see attachment MPT3.  Now I know we 
do not have those annexures but can you just elaborate on what you 
were referring to here? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair the – let me start with the 
issue of the existing bilateral agreement.  This was an indication that 
agreements were signed between the two departments.  It covered a 
whole range of issues but it also indicated that relationships between 
the two departments can be created relating to issues of agriculture 
which were covered in that agreement. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I point you to an MOU that is part of 
20 
the Court Papers in fact the copy I am holding here can be found in 
Court Records Chairman.  The Court Records file. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  B – Court Records B and it is at page 659.  
What we tried to do here Chairman was stay with the same numbering 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 46 of 187 
 
so whatever is written in in the black khoki pen will be same number 
that we as the commission have used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We just tried to – instead of changing the 
numbers we stayed with their index to make our lives easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  659 you said? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  659 Chairman.  Have you got it Mr 
Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct I have it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is this the agreement that you are 
10 
referring to which was signed on the 4 June 2010? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is this – is this the correct document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct document. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We referring to. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we can safely assume that MPT3 is the 
document that is on page 659 of the Court Record? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV 
LEAH 
GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
Now 
the 
heading 
here 
reads 
20 
“Memorandum of understanding between the government of the 
Republic of India and the government of the Republic of South Africa on 
agricultural cooperation.”  Correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Why do you call it an agreement – a 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 47 of 187 
 
bilateral agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair this might have been maybe the 
correcting quoting but this is the document we are referring to as 
attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the issue with that Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is not an agreement Chair that is the 
first thing about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is not an agreement it is a memorandum 
of understanding Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the – oh the emphasis was on agreement rather 
than on bilateral. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Well yes because I am assuming that the 
relationship that was being carved with Paras was based in part on 
what Mr Thabethe understood this document encouraged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no my – I thought that when you were asking 
him why he was calling it bilateral agreement the emphasis was 
bilateral but that is not what it was.  It was about agreement or 
memorandum. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now it is important Mr Thabethe to clarify 
this because this document has been relied on my understanding of 
these papers as a document that encourages South Africa including 
organs of state like the Provincial Government and the Department to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 48 of 187 
 
engage the Government of India or companies in India for various 
purposes.  But what it actually says is first you will find the purpose I 
have no difficulty is with rather it is to promote scientific and 
technological capacity building.  Then the competent authorities it is a 
government to government memorandum of understanding. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Scope of application says the competent 
authority shall subject to the domestic law enforce in their respective 
countries endeavour to facilitate the necessary support and facilities to 
implement 
joint 
agricultural 
development 
programmes. 
 
More 
10 
importantly article 5 speaks to a joint agricultural working group.  Now 
article 5.1 are you there?  5.1 article 5 sub 1.  This is important. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It says: the joint agricultural working 
group herein after referred to as the JAWG shall be established to 
implement the provisions of this memorandum of understanding.  Now 
when you made reference to this document in your paragraph 8 in 2017 
were you aware that this document has no legal force in this country? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair if I may respond to the 
question?  The establishment of the dairy does not rely on this 
20 
document.  This document offers protection in case if you have a 
relationship with a country and you get into problems you are able to 
interact because you have got an existing agreement.  So government 
can assist you to facilitate if you have challenges.  Hence we then 
being quoting this document.  We have not been saying this is the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 49 of 187 
 
document that allows us to the do the process but it provides the 
platform for us when we have got problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It enables you not to be asked who in the country 
have you ever seen dealing with that country. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did you come about to have dealings with that 
country?  You say well it is a country with which South Africa has an 
established arrangement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is the precise point Chairman.  South 
Africa does not have an established arrangement with India not in 
terms of this document.  There may be another one but not in terms of 
this document.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So is there no memorandum of understanding such as 
the one that is reflected on that page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman the correct interpretation of this 
particular document is that the joint agricultural working group is the 
vehicle through which this particular document or this agreement rather 
will be operationalised.  Now 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no my question is, that page – what was the 
page where that memorandum appears? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  65 the memorandum itself Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so my question is. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is on 659. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 50 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is are you saying that there was no such 
memorandum this is a fake thing or something – did it not exist, was it 
not entered into between South Africa and India that document or is 
your point on the content of the memorandum? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There are two points Chairman.  The latter 
but more importantly the misrepresentation in the affidavit by calling it 
a bilateral agreement.  A bilateral agreement and as Mr Thabethe is 
aware goes through various hoops before you sign a bilateral 
agreement between two countries.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay let us try and get this clear.  So it is 
10 
accepted that there was a memorandum of understanding between the 
two countries, is that part correct? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That there was one that was signed 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes because this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was signed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that part is fine? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The part which is in contention is whether it is 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 51 of 187 
 
an agreement, is that part of what is in contention? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The reliance of the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the document? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Irrespective of what it is called whether agreement or 
understanding. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No it is important to have the right label 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because it has different. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It has different legal standing depending 
on what it is.  A memorandum of understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can never be a bilateral agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but that is why I said I want to find out 
whether another point of contention is whether it is an agreement or 
not. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  And then the reliance whether reliance 
20 
on it was justified? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Those are the points of contention? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely Chairman. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay alright. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 52 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you – you want to add? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No I was simply going to say contextually 
it was also important because Mr Thabethe represents the Provincial 
Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When he is interacting with a private 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And provision for that is made in this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the memorandum? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will take him to it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you understand – you understand the points of 
difference so I think: 
1. It is whether that memorandum of understanding is an agreement 
obviously that raises the question when you say bilaterally the 
whole question starts from being an agreement because if it is 
not an agreement then you do not even go to whether or not it is 
20 
a bilateral agreement.  But of course it is between two countries 
as I understand the memorandum. 
2. The second point of contention is whether there was justification 
for reliance on it to the extent that there may have been 
justification on your side for relying – or there may have been 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 53 of 187 
 
reliance on your side on it.  You understand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I do not know whether you would then want to 
take from there now that there is clarity. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I just want to point out that article 6 – so 
we have dealt with article 5 which is the implementation article.  Article 
6 at G says cooperation shall consist of but not be limited to the 
following and item G says: promotion of contacts between the relevant 
10 
public and private enterprises, organisations and other such fields as 
may be agreed upon by the parties.  So you are a public entity, Paras is 
a private entity.  Had the implementation mechanism been operational 
you would be relying on G, am I correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is correct Chair.  Can I – can I – 
can I maybe mention something? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Our reference to this document was 
for protection in an event where we have a problem then we will revert 
to this document and request the Department of Agriculture in India to 
20 
assist because they – the forms of cooperation have been indicated 
that document that it could be public to public or public to private and 
so.  So that in an event where you are no longer treated fairly then you 
go back to the Department and say, we need your assistance in this 
area and this agreement will then assist you.  Because we are already 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 54 of 187 
 
– because there were already set-ups that were formed, meetings that 
were happening between the two country departments where you were 
raising your problems, they raise their problems and you are able to 
resolve those problems and proceed.  Hence the document refers to 
establishments of those systems. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Thabethe if you look at article 12 it 
reads thus: 
“The memorandum of understanding shall enter into 
force on the date on which each party has notified 
the other in writing through the diplomatic channel of 
10 
its compliance with the constitutional requirements 
necessary for the implementation thereof.  The date 
of entry into force shall be the date of the last 
notification.” 
Now those constitutional requirements that are necessary have not 
been concluded and you are aware of that are you not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair maybe I am not reading it 
correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the question is are you aware of that or not?  Let 
us start there.  Yes you are aware or no you are not aware and then we 
20 
can take it from there.  What Ms Gcabashe is saying to you is that 
before that memorandum of understanding could be operational – could 
be put into effect certain things had to be put in place.  They are set 
out in the memorandum and she has referred you to them.  And as long 
as those things had not been done the memorandum of understanding 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 55 of 187 
 
could not be of use and she is saying you are aware that those things 
had not been done.  Are you not aware that they had not been done as 
yet when this happened? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am not aware that they have not been 
done Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I – I am – the reason I raised 
this aspect as one of concern is because I have assumed that the 
Premier and the MEC would have taken comfort in the fact that they 
were told that there is a bilateral agreement that supports what they 
want to do with the private company in India.  And that is really where 
10 
the concern lies.  You interacted with the MEC – with EXCO.  You – I 
know we will get some of that documentation in due course you have 
not been able to produce it and when they considered the matters you 
brought before them as I understand your paragraph 8 you would have 
said to them do not worry we actually have a bilateral agreement.  So 
there is this protection which you are referring to now that we would 
have should things go terribly wrong.  So you are misleading them in 
the information that you are giving them essentially and yet they are 
the people whose decisions, whose views you have relied on. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja Chair I had attached these 
20 
documents for everybody to see to agree not to agree.  So it was at the 
disposal of everybody.  Including the people that could have advised 
differently to say but we do not agree with you.  This document has 
also been attached to a number of other documents that we had been 
legally doing.  Hence I am saying Chair the reference to this document 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 56 of 187 
 
was for protection purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let us talk about that protection because 
in part that is what Ms Gcabashe is talking about but she may – at this 
stage she might be talking about a certain aspect of the protection.  Let 
us talk about another aspect of protection. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a protection that I said to you, you may have 
been thinking of and you agreed.  Okay?  Now the point – part of the 
point being made is I will – or at least that is what I am thinking.  If you 
are going to rely on an agreement or on this memorandum of 
10 
understanding at least you would be expected to check that it was 
operational already.  Because if it was not operational it could not give 
you any protection, do you agree with the latter part? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so did you check whether it was 
operational before relying on it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair the document was already 
operationalised because ongoing meetings were happening between the 
two departments.  The Department of Agriculture in South Africa and 
the Department of Agriculture in India.  So this memorandum of 
20 
understanding was being operationalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you heard Ms Gcabashe referring you to a 
certain clause I think it was 5 if I am not mistaken which sets out what 
needed to be done before the memorandum could be operational.  Do 
you not agree that those requirements that she drew your attention to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 57 of 187 
 
were requirements that had to be met before the memorandum could be 
operational?  Do you not agree with that part?  Irrespective of what 
may have been happening factually namely maybe there were meetings 
taking place notwithstanding the fact that maybe those requirements 
had not been met.  Leave out what may have been happening factually.  
If you look at that clause and requirements being set do you not agree 
that those requirements would have had to be met before the 
agreement – the memorandum could be operational? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair that is the part that I am – I 
was not agreeing with.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just talk – talk to that, let me hear that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  My understanding of that was you 
cannot do business with a country until there is a signed bilateral 
agreement country to country.  That is the one which I said I do not 
agree with that one.  Because at – until you get to the country to 
country you must have examples of cooperation’s that have been 
successful that you can be part of your motivation for the signing.  You 
may not rely all – you cannot say we will only do business once country 
20 
to country has been signed where there is an objection.  Unless there 
is an objection that we do not encourage country to country but in this 
instance there has been no objection because the Minister when he 
signs an agreement he gets dedicated to enter into that agreement.  So 
I did not see any problem for this to happen. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 58 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but just to make sure that we understand each 
other.  Are you saying that the clause that Ms Gcabashe read to you 
has reflecting requirements that had to be satisfied before the 
memorandum of understanding could be operational?  Are you saying 
you do not agree that that clause says that?  Or do you want to be 
referred to it?  Ms Gcabashe do you want to continue from there? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In his affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman can I – can I again just 
elaborate a little bit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On the points that you are raising. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What underscores my concern with the 
manner in which you have used this document is the fact that in 2010 
when this agreement was entered into you in fact worked at the 
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry, did you not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So you knew about this document because 
you worked in that environment? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You then moved to the Free State to 
principles who know that you have come from a particular national 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 59 of 187 
 
environment. They accept you into the Department of Agriculture / the 
Department of Rural Development on the understanding that when you 
bring information to them such as a memorandum of understanding that 
was signed in relation to agriculture they can trust the representations 
that you are making to them.  You understand what I am saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I understand. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is precisely the point I make.  
Because you knew that a joint working committee first had to work 
through all the legalities, the constitutional issues you knew that this 
document would only come into force at a later stage yet you relied on 
10 
it in 2012 and continued to rely on it now in 2019. 
MR 
MBANA 
PETER 
THABETHE: 
 
Chair 
the 
memorandum 
of 
understanding had a timeframe period and this timeframe period was to 
establish these committees to make sure that becomes operational.  
Our reference to the document was to say there is already an 
established relationship so the two countries are talking to each other.  
That is what we were saying here.  We were not saying the country has 
– get to a stage where we have a relationship that is not bound by 
timeframes.  And we have attached the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay just – just so that we make progress.  From 
20 
what you say it seems to me that you accept council’s proposition that 
the structure contemplated by the memorandum had not been 
established, is that correct?  You accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The JW. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 60 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Had been established Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had been established? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it in operation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was in operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay it is just important that when a question is being 
put to you you deal with it first even if you have some elaboration so 
that we know where areas of difference are.  So you say the structure 
to which she referred had been established? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does that mean that your understanding therefore 
is that that memorandum of understanding – let me rephrase that.  Is 
your understanding therefore that everything, every requirement had 
been met that needed to be met for the memorandum to be operational? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Otherwise Chair there would not have 
been meetings between the two countries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no let us get it right.  Are – is that a yes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no I am saying – I am confirming 
Chair that it has been met. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they have all been met? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because meeting has been ongoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman because it is our job to make 
enquiries as a commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 61 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We actually made enquiries in government 
and I have an email from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That reads as follows: 
“The MOU for the RS – Republic of South Africa and 
India was signed by the parties on the 4 June 2010 
and never came to force though the implementation 
mechanism in the form of the joint working group on 
agriculture is ongoing.” 
10 
So and this is from the Director who heads the Directorate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My understanding of this Chairman is that 
it never came to force and if a simple enquiry by the commission can 
elicit a response from the Directorate responsible for that part of the 
world I do not see why a former colleague who worked in that 
department could not just have made enquiry before relying on a 
document and alloweing his principles to believe that they could rely on 
a particular document.  I – that is where my difficulty lies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us - let me just go back to … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page 6-5-9 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  6-5-9. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  I would like to add Chairman and to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 62 of 187 
 
you Mr Thabethe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That that paragraph 8 I refer to in your 
affidavit of 2017 precedes the visit to India paragraph.  So I am 
assuming - it is the only inference one can really draw that when you 
went to visit Paras you gave them the same impression with respect to 
the relations between India and the Republic of South African and that 
is of real concern because they took your word for it as did our 
provincial representatives/Government representatives largely because 
of your history in that national department. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair can I - can I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Respond to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I do not agree Chair.  I am - I - I 
thought I was explaining to say putting - putting it in force would mean 
eventually that the - the two countries have got an agreement and the 
difference between putting this agreement in force.  It means the 
systems were activated.  That - that is my understanding. 
The systems were activated and the response she is reading 
20 
says so.  That the systems have been activated.  They are ongoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe let us - let us - I may have also 
contributed to some of the confusion.  I had understood - no I think my 
understanding was - was correct.  5.1 - Article 5.1 says: 
“A joined agricultural working group shall be 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 63 of 187 
 
established to implement the provisions of this 
Memorandum of Understanding.” 
So from that you can see that what is said is that for the 
implement of this memorandum you need this group. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Now my understanding which may have been 
wrong of Ms Gcabashe’s question to you or one of the questions much 
earlier was that she was saying this group had not been established 
and therefore there could be no - the memorandum could not be 
operational. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I may have misunderstood that part but you - you 
did say recently that … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The group who had been established … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I think the email that Ms Gcabashe has read 
confirms that part. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the group had been established. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is factually correct it would seem therefore that 
the group that was supposed to implement the memorandum was there. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether or not they were implementing the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 64 of 187 
 
memorandum … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The memorandum, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might be another issue but that they had been 
established seems to be accepted as factually correct. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I am happy to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To just get an affidavit from this particular 
directorate … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I can also confirm that when you look 
at the DIRCO website - my colleague has just shown me - you have 
agreements that have been signed.  There are Memorandum of 
Understanding there as well.  This particular one is reflected on the 
site with the ones that have been brought into force a note is there 
against that particular agreement. 
With this particular agreement there is no note that says it 
has come into force. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I really am simply questioning the 
diligence of this very senior public official. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well may - maybe before we look at the diligence we 
look - we need to look at what it is that needed to be done in order to 
put it in force if the establishment of the group was not enough to put it 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 65 of 187 
 
in force.  So let us cover that because maybe that is where the - the 
trick is. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So if you then look at Article 5.2 it reads 
as follows: 
“The heads of the JAWG shall be senior officials.” 
Sub 3 reads: 
“The JAWG shall be responsible for establishing 
working groups, approving and overseeing their 
10 
work 
plans, 
assessing 
the 
outcomes 
of 
implementing programs of the Memorandum of 
Understanding, submitting proposals for the future 
development and improvement and recommending 
solutions to overcoming problems and difficulties.” 
That is where the protection element that Mr Thabethe - that 
you referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we - we will have to check with him … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This does not give him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether that is what he was talking about. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that - is - are - is - is - are the things mentioned in 
Article 5.3 the things you were talking about when you said you would 
rely on this memorandum for protection if something went wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  The - the items that are 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 66 of 187 
 
being mentioned here were programs of the working groups that they 
will - they are going to work on but it - it does - it does not say all - all 
investment opportunities that exist between the two countries have to 
go through this working group.  It - it does not say that. 
So it - it says these are the key areas that - they will be dealt 
with and the meetings between the two working groups will be 
continuously dealing with - with those things and that is my 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just articulate again what it is that you regarded as 
protection that you thought was necessary for your - for arrangements - 
10 
arrangements relating to Paras in relation to this memorandum. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Protection will mean there - there is 
ongoing engagement between the two countries.  If - if you were to 
raise a concern you have a platform that you can get into and raise 
your concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the protection because the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - it - it is there.  It is in 
existence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is the protection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you were talking about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you - you could then go to approach national - 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 67 of 187 
 
the National Department of Agriculture … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And say we have an agreement with a private entity in 
India … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we have these problems.  See whether the 
Government of India can assist us or not. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I believe it can be cleared up by 
10 
an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Might I just point out though that Article 8 
of the same Memorandum of Understanding deals with the details of 
joint implementation programs.  So that is a completely separate 
section.  The details of the joint implementation program but be that as 
it may Chairman the - the concern really is what Mr Thabethe - the 
concern is what you did given that you the Head of a Department and 
accounting officer in relation to your reliance on this document to give 
comfort to your principals and to give comfort to a third party that some 
20 
protection would be a forward. 
Some - some - afforded because there was a vehicle for 
resolving any difficulties that might arise.  This document does not give 
you that protection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you are free to - to comment and defend your 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 68 of 187 
 
position if you want to do that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank - thank you Chair.  Chair I do 
not agree that the document will not offer any protection because it 
offers you a platform to raise your concern because if - if the 
Government of that country can then engage and you are able to 
engage them the problem will be where you do not have a platform to 
engage then. 
Then you have a problem.  You do not know who to talk to.  
Therefore I say it does not mean that this document was just signed for 
the sake of signing.  It - it is for assisting the country. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it might - you - you say it might not be strict 
protection or guaranteed protection but you say it provides - it provided 
a channel through which you could ask the Government of India to do 
something if Paras gave you problems? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of what it is that the Government of India 
could do or could not do that you do not know? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it could be that there was legally no protection it 
could provide but you say at least a request could be sent through 
channels? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 69 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I just say Mr Thabethe that one of the 
reasons this agreement - I beg your pardon - this Memorandum of 
Understanding and its interpretation is important to the matters of the 
Vrede Dairy Project is because there was a debate on whether you had 
established a private/public partnership in engaging Paras and Estina 
or whether some other form of agreement had been entered into. 
Now the memorandum - there was that debate.  Maybe I 
should stop there first.  There was a debate.  Was there not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - there were suspicions Chair 
that we have entered into an illegal public/private partnership but at 
10 
that stage we had an agreement signed and it was not that.  So I do not 
understand where it came from because there was an agreement on the 
table and the agreement was not a PPP agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No I think Ms Gcabashe simply wanted you to 
confirm that there were people who were saying is this not a public you 
know a private - public/private partnership agreement and others saying 
it is not.  I think that is what she is talking about and you are 
confirming that … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is so. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And this particular Memorandum of 
Understanding could either have afforded a vehicle or protection - the 
protection you speak of had it been in operation or - and people should 
have understood its status or it would not have and that is - that is 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 70 of 187 
 
really the bottom - the bottom line.  The manner in which you have used 
this document.  That is - that is really the only contentious point. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I do not agree.  The - the 
debate was not on the basis of this document and it did - it has never 
referred to this document to be have been used for that debate.  That is 
why I say I do not - I do not agree because later it was also confirmed 
that indeed it is not after all documents were - were made available. 
So it - it might not have been referred to this document 
because this document was released later not before the debate but 
when the inquiries were done it is only then that they saw this 
10 
document.  So it might not have been used or relied on for the debate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I am moving onto a new … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I was about to say we have spent quite some 
time … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On this document, ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Gajinder Kumar 
- you then invited him to come to South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When did he arrive in South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I need to refer back Chair to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Feel free to do so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Page 288 of HH10 might be of assistance 
to you.  Your paragraph 12. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 71 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  258. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I hope I am getting - oh, no.  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Two - 238 not 288, 238.  That is the 2017 
affidavit. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair.  You say 
it is paragraph - Chair? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  1-2 - 12.  You then invited the Chief 
Executive Officer of Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say 238? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  2-3-8 Chairman and it will just be 
paragraph 12 of the - the clean document.  I beg your pardon 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  No, no. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is page 238 period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think all this discussion about that 
memorandum has confused me. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is just page 238 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am - I was - I was looking at the black 
20 
numbers instead of the red numbers. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So yes I have got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then paragraph 12 thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 72 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
You 
just 
needed 
some 
reminder 
Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I was - it is referring to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red numbers hey.  Have you got it?  The red 
numbers page 2-3-8. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I have got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I thought it - it was referring me to 
10 
the attachment which indicates the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  This paragraph does not give the 
dates because the question was when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I thought you might be able to remember 
once you looked at the manner in which you had noted it in your 
affidavit.  In any event would it have been early in the year, would it 
have been … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Later in the year, would it have been 
towards the end of t2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair in my founding affidavit those 
dates were - were indicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were given. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 73 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Can I - can I look for that one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because it has the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I do not know whether you need the particular 
detail Ms Gcabashe whether just the month might do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The month is in order Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember - was it early in - in 2012, 
February/March? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was it in the previous year? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I do not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I cannot remember. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Would it have …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it soon after you had come back - you had come 
back from India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was - it was after I had come back 
from India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But reasonably soon or two/three months later or - 
after you came back?  You will not be held to that as long as it is more 
20 
or less - gives us an idea. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It could have been a month or two 
Chair.  It was not a very long period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be good enough. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But I can … 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 74 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that - is that good enough? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is good enough Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is an introduction to a totally different 
topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Line of questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It - so it would have been before you 
10 
signed the agreement of 5 June? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Right.  Who suggested that Estina partner 
Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair during the visit of the - 
the Indian company … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Paras.  They - they indicated interest 
not only on the model but also to invest into the project.  Then my 
concern to them was that it - it would be very difficult to interact and 
20 
enter into an agreement with a foreign company.  For us to be able to 
do that they must register in South Africa or have a partnering company 
that they - we can operate with. 
That - that is what we indicated to them.  That we will not be 
able to do so because if - if you enter into an agreement with a 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 75 of 187 
 
company that its laws do not apply in South Africa we are going to 
struggle.  They had to register or identify a company which they can 
work with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence therefore that when you went to 
India Estina had not been identified yet as a company that would be 
involved in this dairy project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that stage when you went to India is the 
position that you were not contemplating as yet that Paras would need 
to be registered in South Africa or that they would need to work with a 
10 
local company.  At that stage is it something that only came up when 
they visited South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair.  What I 
can also indicate is that it was also our interest to raise their interest 
for investment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which during the visit they indicated 
that they can work with us but they had not confirmed if they would 
want to invest.  Hence we then invited them to say this is where we 
want to do the project.  This is how we want to do the project.  Are you 
20 
interested?  Can we use your - your model because we did not want 
also to be accused of using a model that we do not have permission to 
use? 
On - on those basis then I invited them to come and we had 
discussion with them.  We took them to the site where we in turn 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 76 of 187 
 
thought we will have the project put up and then they indicated the - 
the interest and we - we therefore indicated to them how would - we 
would want them to - to work with us.  Either to register or to have a 
company in South Africa that they could work through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you were in India having discussions with 
the Paras officials was your contemplation simply that you were - you 
wanted to see how their model worked and you would then come back 
and seek to apply it in south - in South Africa and that their 
involvement in the project would be limited to the fact that you were 
using their model and maybe where you have problems you could 
10 
consult them but that - that is where - how far they would go? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It - it was both Chair.  In an event 
they would have said no we do not want to be an investor in the 
project.  We - we would then only get permission from them to use their 
model. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you wanted to use their - your first prize 
was permission to use their - their model … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Their model, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And them being an investor in the program? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and you discussed these while - while you 
were in - in India with them … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a possibility? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Correct Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 77 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they indicated some inclination one way or 
another? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The - the use of the model - 
they were actually saying it will open up for them because in - in their 
presentation they have also indicated to us that they - they were 
exporting milk from India to - I am trying to recollecting now whether it 
was Nigeria or - but I think it was Nigeria where they have been putting 
milk. 
They would say then if - if you have a system similar to us 
they believe that this milk could then be taken from South Africa to 
10 
Nigeria because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They would have guaranteed - 
because in their presentation their qualifications and their certificate 
indicated which qualifies particular products in terms of the registration 
and ISO numbers.  So those were the things that we wanted them to 
assist us to guarantee those levels of quality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I think I may have asked you this question 
yesterday but I want to ask it again because I am trying to look at this 
issue from different angles including your angle okay.  Could you just 
20 
tell me again what the important features were of this model of Paras 
that you wanted to implement in - in South Africa in terms of this 
project?  What were the special features? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair where - where - when we 
did our initial research we realised that in the model they were 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 78 of 187 
 
collecting milk from the small farmers and - and that is what we 
intended to do versus the other models that we have been looking at.  
The system of collecting the milk plus the additional support that they 
have been given. 
So that was key for us because we have - we have not seen a 
model similar to that being - being implemented somewhere and - and 
that is what we wanted to do.  When we went there we then established 
other advantages that were not part of our - our presentation like the 
support system that they have been giving to the farmers.  They would 
not only collect the milk but they had a system of supporting them and 
10 
making sure that these enterprises were growing. 
So those - those were - were also good enough for us to say 
if - if you had to become investors would these features also come with 
you so that you assist that we the expected.  Some of the issues that 
were there were - were the certification that international certification 
for their milk which you could use to export the meat and sell it 
anywhere like they were doing so. 
Those were additional features which if they are not party to 
you - you would not use them.  They can only be used by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  I do not understand this thing that you would 
20 
require permission from them to collect meat from the - from the local 
farmers.  Are you able to …? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not - not the collection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You - remember when you market milk 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 79 of 187 
 
it has ISO standards which is accredited to you.  Certain levels of - of 
hygiene and so on.  You need them to assist you to achieve that 
standard because they have been there.  They know how to deal with it.  
Then they will provide support to your farmers to produce milk of that 
standard of certification. 
That is what I am trying to say.  Not to collect the milk.  You 
can collect the milk but it may not reach the standard … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Which they had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of actual certainty of content what was 
10 
special about what they did to put the milk at the right quality level?  
Was that something that is unusual in South Africa what needed to - 
what they were doing to make sure their milk was at the right quality? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair they will never tell you.  It is - it 
is - they - they - that is the information that you never get to know.  
They will never tell you how they achieved because they are in - in the 
competition.  There are things that they do to get them to a particular 
level.  They will never tell you.  If - if I may use an example Chair. 
KFC will never give you their ingredients to get to what you - 
you eat as KFC because they do not want you to do it.  It is their 
20 
intellectual property.  If you want it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, I understand that.  I am sorry.  I am 
interrupting you Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I understand that but in South Africa there are big 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 80 of 187 
 
companies which deal with milk and that milk must be at a standard 
which is acceptable nationally in the country. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you were not looking at exporting the milk that 
you would produce from this farm.  You were not looking at that.  So 
whatever the standard is you - you had no reason to what any standard 
that would be beyond the standard accepted nationally in South Africa.  
That is my thinking. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now the companies here in South Africa must 
10 
be able - must be able to put - must be able to say this is what you 
need to do if you want your - the quality of your milk to reach this level.  
Why - why - what is special as a feature in that with regard to Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  This is the debate that we 
have had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We had invited them but they did not 
respond to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But you say you are also not able to articulate and 
you must just be -  you must listen to me carefully because I don’t want 
20 
to put words into your mouth, you must be able to say if you say that’s 
not correct.  You’re not able to say what the content of the feature is 
that you were looking for in their model insofar as putting the quality of 
milk at a certain level.  You simply say there is something they do, I 
don’t know what it is, and I know they won’t give it to me but I like it 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 81 of 187 
 
and that’s what I want. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   You are correct Chair, the general 
hygiene standards are set and those general hygiene standards are set 
by Agriculture, but in each and every company there are features that 
you’ll never know, that they will not disclose to you other than the 
general hygiene standard that you must set but those general hygiene 
standards that are set Nationally needs expertise for you to be able to 
achieve that, now if you have a group of small farmers you want them 
to achieve those standards, you need to provide expertise support to 
them for them to be able to reach those standards. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    So in the end it appears to me, that really for all 
intents and purposes, your evidence amounts to saying, and I want you 
to be able to say whether you agree or not, amounts to say really, the 
only reason why we find ourselves having to work with Paras was that 
the local companies were not interested in helping us? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Now Mr Thabethe, Mr Kumar arrives in 
the country and you talk to him about a local partner, had you not 
mentioned the local partner aspect to him…[intervention]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Ms Gcabashe I’m interrupting you again, I 
think that answer also says, in effect, that really there might have not 
been any significance in their model because if the local companies 
were prepared to work with us, what they would have given us would 
have been adequate for our purposes as well. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 82 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   What I believed Chair, was that 
between us and them we could have worked a model. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Just repeat that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   My belief was that between us and 
the companies in South Africa if we would have agreed we would have 
agreed on a model and our model was very simple, provide support to 
the small farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but I think it emphasises the point that I wanted 
to clarify with you that, actually the only reason why, on your evidence, 
the only reason why you end up where you say you end up with Paras 
10 
is because local companies are not interested in working with you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you Chair.  I was talking about Mr 
Kumar and the question was whether you raised the issue of a local 
partner with him when you were in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   My apologies Chair…[intervention]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Did you raise the matter of a local 
partner with Mr Kumar when you were in India? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair, if they were to have 
20 
interest then they would, either come and register as a company in 
South Africa, operating under the laws of this country and if not there 
must be a company in South Africa that they would be able to work 
through. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    In your paragraph 12, at page 238 to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 83 of 187 
 
239, you talk about touring with Mr Kumar, you call him the CEO here, 
the next sentence is talking about the interest he had developed, the 
following sentence says, 
 
“It is when that, the Paras dairy CEO was informed that his 
 
interest of investment in South Africa should be through a 
 
South African registered company”, 
 
So it’s either you informed him when you were busy touring the 
vicinity of Vrede or you had mentioned this to him when you were in 
India, it can’t be both or if it is, maybe just explain it to the Chairman? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I’m trying to find the document Chair 
10 
is it on HH10? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Your affidavit, the one I’m reading from? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 239, Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja same affidavit that we have been looking at, page 
239 of HH10, the one that has got paragraph 12, that we were dealing 
with a little earlier, page 239 the red numbers not the black numbers. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I’m struggling Chair because there’s 
been a divider here, it ends in 235…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think Ms Molefe will help you – you have got 
20 
it?    
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So Mr Thabethe, if you read the first 
three lines of paragraph 12 you will find that you say that you informed 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 84 of 187 
 
the CEO of Paras that any investment should be through a South 
African company when you were touring the Vrede area. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I asked you earlier on if you had 
mentioned the same issue to Mr Kumar when you were in India, and you 
said yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. I’m not sure if I 
had to capture both of them, that I had said it on both side but what we 
have indicated here is, that when he was here we’ve indicated to him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Much as this isn’t written in the most 
10 
elegant English, with all due respect, what’s written here? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I studied bantu education, the 
English that I might have written here, might not have been the best 
English. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No I doubt whether Ms Gcabashe intended to say 
anything 
about 
the 
quality 
of 
your 
English, 
I 
doubt 
if 
she…[intervention]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    It’s the construction, the formulated here 
chair, and all I’m saying is, when one reads this, Mr Thabethe, it’s got 
nothing to do with Bantu education, when one reads this, you are left 
20 
with the impression that it is when the Paras Dairy CEO was informed, 
it is only then when he was here on tour…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no Ms Gcabashe you referred to 
English…[intervention]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can I read it to you Chairman? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 85 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no hang on, you referred to English, and the – 
his answer suggests that he understood from what you were saying that 
you were saying that the English used, was relevant to whether it says 
what he is saying or not and he therefore said, look I studied Bantu 
education.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman can I read the sentence into 
the record, as it is written here? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    This is the relevant sentence, it is 
preceded by context. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja just read it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Mr Thabethe, this is what’s written here, 
 
“It is when that, the Paras Dairy CEO was informed that his 
interest of investment in South Africa should be through a South African 
registered company”,  
 
What should really, on my interpretation be reflected here or 
recorded here is,  
 
“It is then, not when – it is then that the Paras CEO”, 
 
So it’s that confusion that arises from the use of the “it is 
when” as opposed to “it is then” because my interpretation is, “it is 
20 
then”, and this is why I say it was not drafted particularly elegantly, are 
you with me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I still thank that Mr Thabethe was – it was 
legitimate for him to mention what he mentioned, so maybe it’s how – 
you might not have intended what he said, but I think maybe what 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 86 of 187 
 
should happen is, put to him, what you understand this to mean and let 
him answer without any reference to English, maybe we’ll make 
progress if we do it that way. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I believe I’ve now done that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja well do you still need an answer from him? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I still need an answer from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja I don’t remember what the question was, so do 
you remember what the question was Mr Thabethe, do answer if you 
do? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair, I had answered it by 
10 
saying that we had indicated when we were in India and also when we 
were here. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You go on to say, Mr Thabethe, in the 
next sentence, 
 
“In the discussion a proposal of signing an agreement with the 
South African company was put forward to Paras, Paras Dairy had to 
develop a project proposal which was presented through the South 
African owned company”, 
 
So my question is, that second leg of the discussion, did it 
20 
take place in India and in South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair now this is an affidavit that I 
had signed way after, which I was narrating, what had happened, so 
here I was explaining what had happened not…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hang on one second, let me just go back, was the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 87 of 187 
 
question when something happened? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    This further discussion, yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so, I think you may be wanting to explain 
something but the question is when and the answer might be before this 
and that happened or after this and that happened and then if you are 
then asked why, you said that then you can explain if it’s necessary, so 
the question is about when. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Can she repeat the question Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    The paragraph – the sentence that I 
10 
read, refers to discussions that took place at the time that you were 
either touring the Vrede area or around that time, are you agreed with 
that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Right, then the question was, these 
further discussions on the South African company did they take place, 
both in India and in South Africa? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair the discussion on a South 
African company, either being them registering or bringing another 
country took place when we were in India and when we were here.  
20 
What we did when we were here we emphasises after he has raised his 
interest, we then emphasised on it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You go on to say – I’m just trying to 
make progress, really Mr Thabethe, further down in the same paragraph 
that the Paras CEO left the country and at some time appeared Estina 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 88 of 187 
 
company, please tell us about that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair after the CEO of Paras left, the 
company called Estina came to discuss with us that they have been 
appointed, or their relationship with Paras, they would want to take the 
engagement further.  I then said to them there is no problem but I need 
confirmation from them that they are a company that had agreed with 
Paras that we’re going to interact with, that’s what I did. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Yes and then you asked for written 
confirmation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Did you get that written confirmation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I did get an agreement that was 
signed between the two companies. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Again can I refer you to another 
memorandum of understanding?  This one you will find in the reference 
bundle A, I beg your pardon 284…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he was not paying attention when you 
mentioned the page, it’s reference bundle A and page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Page 284 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   284, give it to me I’ll find the page, thank you. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Is this the agreement – what you call an 
agreement – this memorandum of understanding? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s the top number, you have two numbers page 
numbers but it’s the top one they’re both black this time, have you 
found it? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 89 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I’ve got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright, 284, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Is this the document you’re referring to? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this was not the first document 
I got, this was a confirmation of the agreement that has been entered. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So this is not the confirmation that you had asked 
for and received, this was a later agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So MPT11 is a completely different 
10 
document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There should be another document 
Chair, where – that says, we confirm that Estina is the company that we 
will work with, so there should be two documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Would it be a letter or an agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s a letter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It’s a letter? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Who gave you that letter Mr Thabethe? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair the letter was given to us by 
Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Did you ask Paras for that confirmation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   After I’ve received the letter we then 
checked with Paras who will provide us with the memorandum of Estina, 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 90 of 187 
 
so they confirmed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So they confirmed that, what they had 
asked Estina to give you a letter? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They had confirmed that they are – 
the partner company in South Africa is Estina.  So then Estina wrote to 
us to confirm that this is the company of preference by Paras.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So that letter from Estina was emailed to 
you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I don’t remember how it was received 
Chair, whether it was – I can’t recall now but we did receive a letter. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I’m trying to get documents from the 
Department because you do not have the access that we have and this 
is why we ask, because I want to contact the department for these 
documents…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes he can’t remember, he can’t remember if it was 
emailed or sent or hand delivered or sent by post. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes but there is a letter Chair that 
we received. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You, in paragraph 13, talk about a 
verification exercise that was done…[intervention]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we back at 239? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    We’re back at 239 Chairman, paragraph 
13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Page 239, paragraph 13. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 91 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Did you do a due diligence on exactly 
what Estina (Pty) was? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair what we checked whether the 
company, indeed, was registered in South Africa. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can I ask you to stop, don’t forget the 
next point, how did you go about doing that, what document did you ask 
for in checking that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair we have a system in 
Government, we check it ourselves, we go into the register of 
10 
companies and we go in there and check each company and we do 
confirmation by doing so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Continue, so the first thing you did was, 
you did a check through your system? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes and we also checked compliance 
to tax because we may not interact with a company that is not 
registered, so the two key documents that we pulled from the system is 
your confirmation for company registration with company number and 
also the business of the company, that it does, that will be in the 
company registration.  Then we go into the tax system, we check the 
20 
compliance of that particular company and those are the two exercises 
that we do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So you were able to establish that the 
business of Estina was the business of carrying on commercial, 
industrial business, services, sales and support, this you will find, 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 92 of 187 
 
Chairman, in Estina’s memorandum of association which is in the Court 
records at page 565 and 566 – Court record, so it’s the Court record 
file B, for Bernard, Court record file B, 566 has the main business of 
the company.  Don’t go – you’re going too far Mr Thabethe, I’m peeping 
from this side.  So the first document you have there is the certificate 
of incorporation, am I right, what you have there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair 565 is the memorandum of 
association. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Yes correct, then we are talking about 
the same document, continue to…[intervention]. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But this is not the company you get 
fro the system, this is not the document you get from the system. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay maybe you should tell me what you got from 
the system? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The company registration document 
it tells you the name of the company, the director, what is it registered 
for, it’s the – I’m just trying to get the correct name, it’s the 
CIPRO…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    CIPRO document – CIPRO? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s the document I’m referring to 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    That document told you what about the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 93 of 187 
 
business of the company? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It indicated that the company was 
registered for agriculture, farming and related activities, I think there’s 
a copy Chair, on page 586. 
CHAIRPERSON:    586? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, yes, the main business, main object, 
agriculture, farming and related activities. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You are aware that when this company 
was registered, it was registered as a commercial company, what I’d 
10 
read out earlier and  that it then changed, not only the directors but it’s 
main business in or about – and I’m doing this from memory, October 
2012, I can simply confirm it but from memory, having read these 
papers, October 2012 but before October 2012 it was a commercial 
company doing business, doing – it had nothing to do with agriculture, 
would you dispute that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I would not but the document 
in front of me tells me something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:      Yes maybe the question – maybe let’s say this, this 
document was it, in 2012, that you found it, you got it in the system? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair for us to be able to deal with 
any company in Government, we had to deal – because the first thing 
that you do, you collect documentation because you must register them 
into the system in terms of Treasury, so you collect the documentation 
to make sure that they enter into the Government database, so you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 94 of 187 
 
cannot deal with them unless you have registered them into your 
database, so you will need these documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand that, but that wasn’t my question, 
I understand that you have been giving evidence since yesterday, so -  
no, no my question is, when was it when you got this document from 
your system or from CIPRO, it was in 2012, isn’t it?     
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It was in 2012 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja where about in terms of month, I’m not 
necessarily talking about dates, just the month? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I would not Chair – because I do not 
10 
directly deal with it, it’s the supply chain part of the department that 
deals with it, so they do that and then they compile those documents, 
they don’t necessarily bring it to me to say, this is what we have done 
because it is part of the exercise that they do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chair can I be of assistance, in term of 
the MOU that he says followed on after he received the letter and 
presumably after he did the verification exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh just put that to him so that…[intervention]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So you would have checked on or tried 
to verify who Estina was, after you received the letter from Estina 
20 
saying that Paras is partner, after you had seen that the MOU between 
Estina and Paras had been signed, the one that you said was not the 
first MOU, yes or no? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair you do that after you have 
received the confirmation that this is the company that you are going to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 95 of 187 
 
be working with.  Then you go and you check them into the system.  
Then if there is a problem in the system then you would know because 
they will come back to tell you look this company is not registered.  Or 
this company is not tax compliant.  Then that is the due diligence that 
we have to do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I simply want to point you Chairman and 
Mr Thabethe you too to page 563 of the Court Record.  563 of the same 
Court Record.   
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which is a notice of meeting and it reads 
10 
as follows: 
“Estina 
Proprietary 
Limited 
Registration 
number 
2008/015033/07.  Please take notice that a meeting of the 
members of the above company will be held at the 
registered offices of 144 Catherine Street, Block AA, First 
floor Grayston Ridge Office Park, Sandton at 8:30 to 
consider the following resolution. 
1. That the main business – that the main business and 
main object be changed to agriculture, farming and 
related activities. 
20 
2. The change of the registered office to be 144 
Catherine Street, Block A, First Floor Grayston 
Ridge Office Park, Sandton, 2146 dated at Sandton 
on this [blank] day of October 2012 signed by Mr 
Kamal Vasram.” 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 96 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe let us – maybe just to go straight to 
this.  It would appear that prior to October Estina could not have – 
Estina’s business or main business could not have been registered as 
agriculture, farming and related activities if this document is true. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is true that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I accept it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have said that you did not see the document 
at 586 yourself it was other people who would have looked at whatever 
document needed to be looked at? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question that arises is whether you were told 
by anybody that Estina’s business was in the agricultural sector at the 
time the checking had to be done to find out who is Estina and what do 
they do?  Were you told by somebody that or were you not told 
somebody that or were you told something else? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No I was not told Chair the business 
of the company but the compliance had to be checked if there was a 
20 
problem with the compliance then I would have been told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – but were you told anything about whether it was 
tax compliant? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you told or were you not told about that part? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 97 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair the – they would tell you if it is 
not compliant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh if they did not tell you anything it would mean that 
it is compliant. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is compliant yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But did you – were you not interested in 
understanding what Estina’s business or main business is after you had 
been told that they would be involved in your Department’s project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not really Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would you not be interested in that? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair my interest was in Paras 
because that is where the expertise is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Estina was being used as a company 
that is local. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That I would then be able to deal 
with.   Because my interest was which I had verified was Paras.  Paras 
was using Estina if I may mention it as a conduit to be able to do 
business in South Africa. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That has been my key understanding 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you only interest in Estina was whether they were 
tax compliant? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 98 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing else? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The expertise that I wanted was in 
Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what they were involved in you were not 
interested really that is Estina? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not really Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whether they were people who were doing illegal 
things and so on you were not interested in terms of their business? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair it is a very difficult one to 
10 
answer but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am interested.  You are the head of a 
government department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The government department – this government 
department wants to engage in a very important project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has identified a company far away in India as the 
one that they want to be involved with but it is necessary that they 
should be a local company with which that Indian company gets 
20 
involved.  And I would have thought that to say the least you would be 
interested in whether this company is involved in the same sector and 
even if it is involved in the same sector what experience they – they 
have and what type of company are they and how are they run, who are 
their directors?  Will you be dealing with a credible company?  Will you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 99 of 187 
 
be dealing with credible people who run this company as a Provincial 
Government?  Will your association – will the Provincial Government’s 
association with this local company not embarrass the government?  I 
would have thought that you would be interested in those types of 
things that is why I am asking. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thanks Chair.  We have not done it 
because we had never done it with any other company that we have 
been dealing with.  We have been dealing with companies we had never 
gone to that extent of researching requirements were that you check 
compliance.  So we – it did not come that we need to do that because 
10 
we had never engaged in that exercise before. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – what you are confirming is that even if they 
were not – their business was not in the agricultural sector you did not 
mind getting them involved in this agricultural project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair because they were not my 
main focus.  I just needed them so that when – when we – if I may use 
an example?  If we litigate we litigate a local company if we have got 
problems.   
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do not check what they do other than whether 
they are tax compliant whether they are a credible company, whether 
20 
they – they are run by credible people you might litigate with an entity 
that really you do not – you should not even be involved with because 
of the type of business they do or the type of people who run it.  And 
you might litigate and find that they have got nothing.  You might have 
lost a lot of money and now you litigate to – against them to recover 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 100 of 187 
 
anything find that they have got nothing because you did not do your 
homework. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chair we had never gone into the exercise 
before.  That is why it is very difficult for me to respond.  Because we 
had not done it before and it has never been a requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but put aside what a requirement is does it not 
make sense that you would need to do that.  I mean if you as Mr 
Thabethe wanted to get into business with somebody and you were 
going to put a lot of your own money into a certain project would you 
not want to do some homework on – on a person that was going to be 
10 
your partner?  Would you not want to do that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say what type of person is this?  Will I be tainted if 
I am associated with him or her? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja my response Chair would be we 
had dealt with companies in South Africa but we had done that 
research. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you are not answering my question.  Would 
you as Mr Thabethe if you were wanting to go on a business project 
and you were going to put your own money and a lot of your money in it 
20 
would you not want to do a proper check on anybody that would be your 
partner in that project before you signed a deal to – to have that person 
into your project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am not able to respond to the 
question Chair. I – because I… 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 101 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What are you not able – well either – you can tell me 
that no, no as  Mr Thabethe I am – if I want to go into business and I 
would just go into business with anybody I would not do any check.  I 
would not check whether this person is credible.  I would not check if 
this person has spent ten years in prison for fraud and so on.  I would 
just go into business.  If that is what you do you must tell me that is 
what you do. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would not check if this person owns any property.  I 
would not check anything if we lose money because of decisions that 
10 
he makes or things that he does in the project and I need to recover 
money from him he would have nothing.  He does not own anything.  
You must tell me that is how you would do – do it if that is how you 
would do it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair personally in my business 
which I might have done it.  I have never done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I want here Mr Thabethe is your 
assessment of what needs to be done before certain decisions are 
taken because remember in the example that I am talking about if you 
were going to go into business as Mr Thabethe you would be needing to 
20 
protect yourself.  You would be needing to protect your money.  You 
would be needing to protect maybe even your family in terms of 
financial security.  Here you are using tax payers’ money you are the 
head of a department.  You have power to use millions of tax payers’ 
money.  You are put in that position as head of department because you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 102 of 187 
 
must be somebody who has a certain level of understanding of things.  
A certain level of experience maybe just in life but also about what the 
department is about, agriculture and you have got you know degrees in 
agriculture.  Can you be trusted to make the right decisions and to do 
the right things before decisions are made in order to protect tax 
payers’ money that is what it is about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thank you Chair.  In government 
there are regulations on how do you go about doing that and we limit 
ourselves to that and that is what we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you 
10 
1. You did not do any such check and because you believe that it 
was not necessary to do the check – that kind of check. 
Is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no, no Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is important that you must – you must say if what 
I am saying I understand your evidence to be that you should say no, 
no that is not what I am saying.  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am not saying it was not 
necessary Chair I am saying it was not the requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you see sometimes the law and government 
20 
and regulations put requirements but sometimes particularly when you 
are in a senior position the people of South Africa must trust that you 
have the right judgment to say just complying with these requirements 
is not enough.  I must ask for more particularly when there is a lot of 
tax payers’ money that may be put into something. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 103 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I hear you Chair.  My difficulty is that 
I could not set my own requirements I had to live within what has been 
given.  Hence we could not go beyond that because the difficulty in 
government you do less you have a problem.  You do more you have a 
problem.  You have to stay within the line do what is expected of you.  
So you never know when you will be wrong whether doing more or 
doing less so it is better to stay within what you are required to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so let us go back to necessary.  You said you did 
not say it was not necessary you said it was not a requirement.  As you 
stand here, as you sit there now do you say it was necessary to have 
10 
done the kind of check that I am talking about or do you say it was not 
necessary? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am trying to think Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I am trying to think because I am 
trying to recollect on what basis would I say it was necessary or not 
necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your inclination is to say it was not necessary. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am trying to – yes I am trying to 
think Chair on what basis would I – because if I say it was not 
20 
necessary what informs my answer.  That is why I say I would need to 
recollect properly and check whether the answer will be yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your inclination is to think it was not necessary 
but that is not your final answer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No, no let me not respond to that 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 104 of 187 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you would like time to think about it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I see we have gone beyond Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us take the lunch adjournment.  We are at 
twenty past one we will resume at twenty past two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe are you ready? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I am Chairman.  Chairman before we - 
we resume I would like to indicate that when we broke at lunch time 
Mr Thabethe’s attorneys - legal representatives approached me to say 
that they had objected or they were objecting to my use of the sentence 
that the reports - that the statement - that the affidavit was not written 
in the most elegant English. 
They too felt that it was unnecessary.  They explained that in 
fact their client had himself drafted that document.  They had not 
drafted it - a lawyer had not drafted it.  I accepted the explanation on 
20 
who had drafted it Chairman.  I also asked Mr Thabethe to come a little 
closer because I wanted to understand how he had received what I had 
said. 
He indicated he had been hurt by the comment.  Hence his 
reaction - his own reaction.  I then unreservedly apologised to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 105 of 187 
 
Mr Thabethe because that was not the intention.  It never is to make 
anybody uncomfortable about the manner in which they express 
themselves.  I also asked him to please convey my apologies to his 
family because I live in a community of people Chairman and I assume 
he too lives in the community of family. 
I then also made the offer that when we start I would publicly 
so that where his family is as well I would and whoever else heard the 
comment and interpreted it in the manner in which he did should know 
that it was not personal or intended to hurt and again Mr Thabethe my 
apologies.  I hear your sons are here as well. 
10 
Apologies because (African language) he is - he is an 
(African language) and really I am - I am not going to be soft as I 
indicated to you but the intention is not to use intemperate language or 
to affront your dignity in anyway and please if I do - if I do please 
object Mr Thabethe.  I can only learn from it when I am corrected.  It 
can only build my character.  It cannot destroy me but I do apologise.  
Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Ms Gcabashe.  I do not know whether you 
want to say anything Mr Thabethe or not really.  I just do not want to 
cut you off in case you wanted to say something in response. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I would only say I accept her 
apology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Thank 
you 
Ms Gcabashe 
and 
thank 
you 
to 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 106 of 187 
 
Mr Thabethe and his legal representatives.  I am aware that the whole 
issue was handled in a very constructive manner from all sides.  I just 
want to acknowledge that there is a lot of cooperation coming from all 
sides in regard to Mr Thabethe.  His lawyers have been very 
cooperative throughout the proceedings.  So Mr Thabethe has been 
helpful as well.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We may proceed then. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Back to asking you some robust questions 
Mr Thabethe.  I know you are ready for them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has - he has never been readier. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  He knows.  No, no I did say to him 
and we agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Back to business as usual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before - before he - we continue he owes me an 
answer. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh, yes he does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Thabethe you have had some time to reflect 
on the question I put before lunch.  Have you got an answer? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja, thank - thank you Chair.  I - I 
would agree with you Chair that even over and above the requirement 
one would additionally do additional search of information.  So there is 
nothing stopping anybody to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, thanks and looking back you would concede 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 107 of 187 
 
that you should therefore have done much more than just checking 
whether Estina was tax compliant? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  Given the current 
situation I would concede that we could have done an additional check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well could have done is one thing but should you 
have done that is - that is the more - one I am more interested in.  So 
in other words do you - do you concede that you should have done 
more than just checking whether they were tax compliant? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - and one reason why it would be important 
10 
to do that because you - you referred to litigation for example earlier 
on you know.  If you wanted to recover some money from Estina as a 
result of being involved with them in the project and you found that 
they have got nothing.  Then the department would - will - would suffer 
a financial loss that may have been recoverable if it was a company 
that had the right financial base and so on.  You - you appreciate that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe can I 
just add my views on exactly the same topic and also it is something for 
20 
you to - to reflect on and I hope give us a response.  You see four 
issues arise for me in relation to the due diligence on Estina.  The first 
issue is interrogating the nature of the business that they conducted. 
If you want to have reference to the documentation you - you 
find the due reference on page 5-3-5 of the court record.  I do not think 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 108 of 187 
 
it is necessary.  We dealt with it earlier.  Unless you really want to look 
at that document and again at 5-4-1.  The second issue that arises is 
the address of the Sole Director - Mr Kamal Vasram.  It is a Sunninghill 
address. 
So when you received the - the letter confirming they were 
the partners to Paras.  What I would have thought would be you find the 
CIPC details or the Certificate of Incorporation and find that in fact the 
address of this Director appears to be one that is - could possibly be 
one he is running from home.  I am not saying it is in fact one where he 
lives but the address is not the same as the address that appears on 
10 
the documents in October 2012. 
The third issue Mr Thabethe is the - of course the change in 
Director.  Mr Kamal Vasram changed and Su Jong took over as a 
Director.  These issues are important because you have set up an 
Agri-BEE or you are intending to set up an Agri-BEE entity that would 
benefit emerging farmers. 
So if Estina is as a company not completely above board 
number one, if you are putting something close to 500 million - well let 
us call it 300.  Let me take the Paras bit off.  300 million into a project.  
You want to be sure about who you are trading with, who you are 
20 
dealing with.  Am I making sense to you and this is only in terms of why 
I would have expected you to interrogate the issues.  That is the only 
reason I give you the history. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair I am - I am … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 109 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is a statement.  I have not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  I was - I was thinking whether to say 
Ms Gcabashe maybe you should take those three one by one.  Maybe it 
might be easier to - to follow.  I was - I had forgotten which - which was 
the - I - I was - I had forgotten that which are the first and the second.  
So I am wondering whether that might … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have helped - that might have also caused 
Mr Thabethe some uncertainty. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My apologies. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is because I am not trying to rush.  The 
issues you - you have identified Chairman as you interrogate them with 
Mr Thabethe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am simply confirming that as an 
evidence leader. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I make common cause with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is really all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are adding the figure - the amount that … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And - and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was - the department would put it in. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 110 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
So 
- 
so 
Mr Thabethe 
the 
- 
basically 
what 
Ms Gcabashe is saying is when you as the Head of Department were 
going to takes - take R300-and something million of taxpayers money 
and put it into a project with this entity - Estina.  She would also expect 
you to really check to a certain - check much more than what you did 
and she refers to the address of the Director and so on. 
So - but she - she is following upon on what you and I 
discussed earlier.  I take it that you - your answer would be having 
reflected you - you agree that when you are going to put so much of 
taxpayers’ money into a project you should do a better check than the 
10 
one that you did. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair I - I have agreed on 
- on that.  The - the only input I would want to make is that it should 
not sound as if we were going to put this 300 million at a go and it 
disappears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is - that - that is a point that you - you are 
entitled to make, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  I would - I would only say 
if there were to be anything wrong … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It would not be that entire amount 
because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You would pay money, something 
done … 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 111 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If you are happy then you proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm, hm. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So it could be a certain amount but 
not entirely the full amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I accept that Mr Thabethe, ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But let us go back to page 2-3-9 of HH10.  
That is your statement - your affidavit.  Page 2-3-9, your statement or 
10 
affidavit.  It is the 2017 one. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm, the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the page that follows the one that has 
paragraph 12, hey? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact it is - most of paragraph 12 is on 
this page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is on that page, ja.  It is the page that has got most 
of paragraph 12 that we have been dealing with - page 2-3-9 the red 
20 
2-3-9. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have dealt with 12.  We have dealt 
with paragraph 13. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 112 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We are now dealing with the agreement 
that Estina brought to you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that is the agreement of 5 June 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please correct me if I am wrong my 
understanding is that the agreement as drafted was then taken to the 
State Law Advisors.  Am I correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are not referring to the contents of 
the agreement.  You are just - you are on page 2-3-9 but you are 
10 
making reference to the agreement? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and I am at page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Paragraph 14 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will point Mr Thabethe to the actual 
agreement in a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is just understanding who drafted it. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair the - the paragraph 14 she 
20 
is referring to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is - is not taking all the - the steps 
that - I think it - it is at the end of what has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 113 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is at the end of what has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But her question is who drafted the agreement that 
paragraph 14 refers to. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair the - the original agreement 
was drafted by Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now Mr Thabethe help me with this one.  I 
have always understood that where Government enters into contracts - 
into agreements - Government will draft it in a way - that agreement - in 
a way that will protect Government.  The other party will not draft it.  
Am I wrong about that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not all the time Chair.  Where you 
have capacity you do draft and where you do not have the capacity the 
other party can also draft. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Was there an agreement between 
yourselves and either Paras or Estina as to who would draft the original 
20 
affidavit? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They had indicated Chair that they 
would - they would assist in drafting the agreement and then present it 
to us. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where …? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 114 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I guess - I guess that must mean not that they 
would assist if they were going to present it to you.  They would draft it 
… 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  They would draft, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then present it to you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now I am interested in your comment that 
this was really at the end of a process.  I take it that you are indicating 
that you would have had discussions with them about what should go 
10 
into the agreement Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair because 
we - we already both of us had documents at hand.  That document 
would have been then in line with whatever documents that we - we 
were having. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  When you speak of having documents in 
hand you would have had your own draft agreement and they would 
have had their own before the final agreement was generated by 
Estina? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain Mr Thabethe. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Document - documents mean you - 
you all have (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Notes? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You … 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 115 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Notes you mean.  Like your own notes … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what should go into the agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we all know what the intention is 
and it is the same.  Then the - the agreement can be drafted. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Did - do you know whether Paras had 
anything at all to do with the drafting of this original agreement of 
5 June? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair my - in - in all our documents 
my understanding of interacting with Estina was interacting with Paras 
because it was their company identified presented to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the question is whether you knew whether this 
agreement was drafted by Paras without anybody from - no - by Estina 
without anybody from Paras being involved in that drafting or in - in the 
preparation of that document or is the position that you do not know but 
for your purposes as long as it came from Estina you took it as coming 
from Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  Your last explanation … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That is the correct one? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is - is the correct one yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not know whether anybody from Paras had 
been involved in the drafting of the agreement but as long as it - it 
came from Estina you took it that for all intents and purposes it was 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 116 of 187 
 
coming from Paras? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The reason that becomes an important 
consideration Mr Thabethe is because my reading of the Memorandum 
of Understanding between Paras and Estina is that it is a one year 
Memorandum of Understanding.  Was that your understanding as well? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second issue arising from the 
Memorandum of Understanding was that Estina would be the agent of 
10 
Paras.  Was that your understanding? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The third issue that arises from the 
agreement is that Estina would look for business opportunities 
including in the agricultural sector for Paras.  Was that your 
understanding? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am trying to think Chair.  Not 
outside this agreement.  I would not be interested in other businesses 
that they would have looked for Paras outside what we were doing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for the sake of convenience the 
20 
Memorandum of Agreement is in Reference Bundle A.  So it is reference 
bundle - Reference Bundle A at page 284. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Indistinct). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your mic Mr Thabethe.  Thank you.  I am 
looking at page 289 of that document where Clause 4 deals with the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 117 of 187 
 
duties and responsibilities of Estina.  I will not go through all of them 
but simply highlight that the first one says: 
“Estina shall identify and secure opportunities 
whereby the company can participate for the project 
implementation in both Government and private 
sector.” 
You agree that is what is recorded here? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I really do not want to go into all of them 
because I do not believe it is necessary.  I am just illustrating the point 
10 
I make about Estina being an agent looking for business opportunities 
for Paras - the company being Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But let us move beyond this document and 
of course this particular document - I beg your pardon Mr Thabethe.  I 
am looking at page 2-9-5 right now and you have Ms Sanjeev Gautam 
who signed on behalf of Estina and you have Mr Gajinder Kumar who 
signed on behalf of Paras and though my copy is a poor copy I believe 
this document was signed in May 2012 but I will correct that if I am 
wrong if we find a better copy.  The copy I have is rather poor. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Thabethe might be able to say whether that was 
the correct month.  Do you have any recollection … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it was signed in May? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I think it is correct Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 118 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The copy is very poor but I - I 
think it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact if I might correct myself my 
colleague … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Has just pointed out that if we look at 
page 285 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It says that the Memorandum of 
Understanding is dated 11 April 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So at least it is in the same - more or less 
same ballpark period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well that - would - would that necessarily have 
been the date of signature or it could be a date of the preparation of 
the document and - and it does not matter probably for our purposes 
but I am just saying there may - may well be correct if maybe if there 
are different dates for preparation and signature? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It really does not matter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will bring it to your attention … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If we do find a better copy. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 119 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  So again my colleague is 
making the - the point that at page 286 just to deal with the date. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At page 286 you have under definitions 
MOU date as meaning and referring to 11 April 2011 being the date of 
execution of this MOU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So at least we - we do not need to debate 
that date.  The agreement - the very first agreement - I am just looking 
10 
at the cover page which is page 6-1-9 Mr Thabethe.  It is called a 
Partnership Agreement between the Department of Agriculture Free 
State Province South Africa and Estina (Pty) Ltd.  Are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I also want to get there.  6-1-9? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of Reference … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A, Reference Bundle A? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  B, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  6-1-9 of Reference B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Did - did you know whether we will still need 
20 
the court record bundles … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This afternoon? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes please Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 120 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do not put them too far away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Bring it to me.  I will - must the - I will find the 
page. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  if - if you can repeat the page sir. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The page number is 6-1-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  6-1-9 on Reference Bundle B. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman.  6-1-9 is written on the 
top right hand corner.  Can I ask my colleague - are you good? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have - I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you good?  Thank you.  So I was just 
reading the first two entries there.  So it is a confidential document.  It 
is a Partnership Agreement between the Department of Agriculture Free 
State Province South Africa and Estina (Pty) Ltd.  I would like to pause 
there and ask was this by agreement that you would have Estina (Pty) 
Ltd written here rather than Paras. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Yes Chair.  Remember my - my 
original explanation that if - if you go to this kind of agreement you 
would not then include the international company.  You will only then 
20 
put it with the local company. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you explained then that because of 
jurisdictional issues you want to be sue the local partner? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that is why by agreement you then 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 121 of 187 
 
had … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  With Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Formulated it this way? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am going further down and you say here: 
“In relation to the implementation of a dairy project 
at Vrede.” 
Can I pause again at Vrede?  Now I know that the - the broad 
discussions you had had identified Vrede. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am - that is correct; but you had not 
identified the land that you wanted to allocate to this farm or had you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we had already done so Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You had not gone through the formalities 
of acquiring that land as at June 2012? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Not - not yet Chair.  It - it has not yet 
been formally made available to us but - I - I want to use the correct 
word.  In - in discussion there - there was - there were no objection to 
us having the land. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who would you have had this discussions 
20 
with Mr Thabethe and please I ask you this because on my record your 
visit to the Phumelela Local Municipality was on 12 June 2012?  I do 
not want to confuse you.  So who did you have these discussions with 
prior to signing this 5 June agreement? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair, we - we had already been 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 122 of 187 
 
having interaction with the municipality and the intended beneficiaries 
prior to this because by the time we were formalising we had already 
done a lot of meetings.  Going into Vrede Municipality organising 
meetings for us, talking also to the beneficiaries. 
So already the - the land in question was already available 
but the formalisation of the release of the land had not been done 
which we then later requested that it be formalised. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Two - two things arise Mr Thabethe and I 
am going to chop them up. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will start with the beneficiary issue.  My 
understanding is that as at 5 June there was no formality with regard to 
who the list of beneficiaries might be.  Please correct me if I am wrong. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair we had had the - the list of - of 
who will be the - the beneficiaries of the project because we had 
interacted with them.  We had categorised them into groups.  There 
were those that were interested in pigs.  There were those that were 
interested in vegetables and so on.  So we had had meetings before. 
So we had already known which of those that would have interest and 
we had a list of all of them even before we had formally went back to 
20 
them to say now give us your names and ID numbers for the purpose of 
financing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Mr Thabethe I want to interrogate the 
informality of that, I agree with you, you had been to Thembalishe 
township. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 123 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    With MEC Zwane at the time and other 
officials. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    To speak with beneficiaries, I agree. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You have had asked them to indicate 
their areas of interest as you have just said, who wanted cattle, 
farming, who was interested in poultry etcetera, etcetera. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So this is why I say I am taking issue 
with the informality of the approach and the status of those people as 
beneficiaries of a rather important agreement where the formality of 
registering them as beneficiaries had not been completed.  Are you with 
me? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja, Chair we had the list of the 
beneficiaries, my understanding of formally registering them should 
only come when the National Department says to us we agree in 
financing this endeavour with you, provide us then with your list of 
beneficiaries  with the following details.  It is only then that you go and 
20 
collect, it does not mean that we did not know that, we knew them but 
in the form required we had then to go back and collect that additional 
information, they knew themselves also, so it was easy for us to call 
them and collect the required information. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You see Mr Thabethe my difficulty with 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 124 of 187 
 
that proposition is that fortunately one can look at the history now and 
find that to date in law they have never been beneficiaries, yet your 
intention when you went to see them was to make them beneficiaries of 
this program. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before he responds maybe the in law part 
might confuse because he is not a lawyer, I am saying you are not a 
lawyer Mr Thabethe even though you did not tell me you are not one, 
maybe you are, but can I take it that you are not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No I am not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so he might not be able to say whether you are 
10 
correct or not correct when you say in law there have never been 
beneficiaries, so you might wish to put it differently. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you Chairman.  I will do that.  All I 
am communicating Mr Thabethe is they have no legal recourse as 
beneficiaries, they did not when  you were there in June of 2012 and 
earlier actually today they do not have a legal document that makes 
them beneficiaries, but I know your intention from what I have read was 
that you wanted emerging farmers to be beneficiaries. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair the processes that should 
have unfolded maybe to achieve what is called in law. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The in law part? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The in law part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Did not happen because we were in 
the beginning of the project and one of the responsibilities that we had 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 125 of 187 
 
requested Estina to do was to register a company on their behalf where 
you will then put them in and officially then make them beneficiaries, 
but we did not get to that stage.  The intention was correct but we did 
not get there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You see Mr Thabethe when I look at the 
face of this document the only beneficiary here is Estina because it is 
the registered company that is in business with the Department of 
Agriculture, you would agree with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I would not agree, because we  
have just agreed now that the relationship was to stand for a year, after 
10 
that the company of the beneficiaries will take over, but what I am 
explaining is that we did not get to the – the interventions were before 
we could get there, then the projects came to a stall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what counsel is saying is as at the 5 t h of June 
2012 when you on behalf of the Department of Agriculture signed – well 
one of you I think may have signed later, but at any rate as at the time 
of the signing of this agreement between the Department of Agriculture 
and Estina beyond the beneficiary in terms of this agreement, maybe I 
should not say beneficiary.   
 
The only entity or person that really stood to benefit in terms 
20 
of this agreement was Estina, and not anybody that you may have 
contemplated would ultimately benefit, simply on the face of the 
agreement, but I think that – I hope I have put it accurately ,that that is 
the gist of the proposition. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I would agree Chair with your 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 126 of 187 
 
statement if it was not covered in the agreements side with Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   But that was covered in the 
agreement that they would not be the only beneficiaries, but they would 
be ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, in the future. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In future yes, so it has been covered 
in the agreement signed by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, for the future. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   For the future yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You see Mr Thabethe I am again still 
looking at the front cover page of the agreement, you have a company  
called Zana Investments Pty Limited trading as Mahoma Mobung Dairy 
Project.  I don’t know if you are able to explain who Zana would have 
been and what the intention was in setting out the last bit trading 
Mahoma Mobung Dairy Project.  I fail to understand exactly what this is 
about. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this is exactly what I have 
been explaining, because we wanted to make sure that this company 
20 
becomes the beneficiaries’ company so hence I was saying we register 
this company so that we include it, so that Estina do not become the 
sole shareholder but we are saying in this agreement Zana Investment 
become the stipulated aggregate BEE where we are going to put the 
beneficiaries. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 127 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Zana Investment Pty Limited that you say 
would be the vehicle to benefit the beneficiaries? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can you recall Mr Thabethe who the 
director or directors in the plural of Zana Investments might have been? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair it was a shell company, we 
wanted it registered so that once we have completed all the processes 
then we will take all the beneficiaries and register them into the 
company, so it – like we have indicated it is a shell company, it is not 
10 
yet completed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Mr Thabethe the interest I have in this 
shareholding structure really is quite important and it is important 
because fortunately we have the benefit of the history what is now – 
what happened over the years.  As you correctly pointed out earlier 
government put in money in phases into this project, that is correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    And the idea was to put 114million into 
this particular project over a three year period? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    The beneficiaries, the 100 beneficiaries 
of Vrede, Memele and Warden who have no legal standing at all have 
not seen any benefit from the 114million that you put in, in the first 
year or the second.  You would agree with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair let me go back again. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 128 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   This agreement in front of us was the 
original proposed agreement that I had agreed on.  We had already 
interacted with the farmers so that they have an understanding that 
they are going to become beneficiaries, and we had registered the 
company and we had incorporated the company into the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Zana? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is Zana.  The second agreement 
Chair, I want to get to that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I am happy with that. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I want to get to that.  When we were 
activating the process this agreement was then given to the State Law 
Advisors which were not comfortable with this agreement.  A new 
agreement was drafted that I then signed from the State Law Advisors.  
That agreement does not look like, I was very comfortable with this first 
agreement because it covered all the elements that I was looking at, 
but if the legal people advise you this is the correct one to sign then I 
signed that one, but still with the intent, purpose, of achieving this, 
because I have been advised legally that this agreement did not protect 
the State, hence the second agreement.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Gcabashe said she was happy that you were 
going to the second agreement and that might be because she plans to 
go there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    It is because the issue I want to raise 
DCJ ...[intervenes]  
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 129 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Goes with that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    It is really related to both agreements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let me allow you to ask and then – ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you DCJ.  And that is really the 
issue around the deviation, because this arrangement, I am still on my 
page 619, the cover page, which sets out the parties, this arrangement 
was not done in terms of the SCM policy document that we discussed 
yesterday.   Your view please? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Hence Chair I wanted to object 
yesterday because I saw it was coming. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you did not want to object, you wanted to put your 
views and we said you would get a chance. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, yesterday I was told I should 
not go there yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you have been ...[intervenes]  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Now I see it’s going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have been waiting for the opportunity. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it is your opportunity, use it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Please. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair because I wanted to take 
you through this, we have gone through a number of processes in the 
supply chain processes of providing support to farmers.  I will be very 
short in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second, I am debating in my own mind with 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 130 of 187 
 
myself Ms Gcabashe, whether what I wanted to deal with I should deal 
with now, because once you go to the issue of the deviation that’s quite 
a very important part and it might take us some time, or what is your 
feeling? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Please ask your question Chairman 
because I know that Mr Thabethe has been waiting for mine since 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I will give you the chance to the deal with that, but 
let me ask a few questions on the first agreement first.  Am I right to 
think that this agreement of the 5 t h of July, I think one of you signed it 
10 
on the 7 t h. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, one of you signed on the 5 t h, the other one on the 
7 t h, but I will refer to it as ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the agreement of the 5 t h.  Is the position that 
you signed it without getting a lawyer to look at it and see whether it is 
an order if you sign it for the purpose for which you were seeking to 
sign it, that would be okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair in departments you have legal 
20 
people but not at a level that you may require, but when I went through 
it, it covered the intent of what we have been looking for.   We could 
not see any major issue, I also asked this to the State Law Advisors if 
there was anything in particular that they would have raised which was 
a challenge.   
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 131 of 187 
 
 
The only issue that they raised to us was that it did not protect 
the State, that was the issue that they had raised to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The mic Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course that is a major issue, is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It is Chair but given the position that 
we did not want this to run very long, because we wanted a special 
purpose vehicle which is Zana to eventually take over, because that will 
be the company where the money would go, so this was about initiating 
the process, get it going, getting the company registered, so that when 
10 
we do finances of the farmers it goes to the correct place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was there no money that the Department was 
going to put into this before that vehicle was put in place? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of money is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It was money but not a substantial 
part of the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much was it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There was R30million that we wanted 
to put in so that it sets up the process going. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say that is not a lot of money? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In comparison with the total cost of 
the project Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, alright, yes, but the issue of the interest 
of the government in the agreement would be a major issue because 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 132 of 187 
 
what it could mean is that Government, if the agreement were to 
continue as is it could mean that Government could lose millions of 
money because the agreement does not protect Government’s interests 
is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that proposition correct? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair that was the advice that I was 
given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you accepted the advice? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I accepted the advice Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you say now you are at the point where you 
are interacting with the State Law Advisors after you have signed the 
agreement.  I am at the time when – before you signed the agreement, 
so my question is did it not occur to you that before I sign such an 
agreement that could see Government put in millions of money I should 
get advice from maybe much more senior lawyers than the ones you 
had, maybe let me ask the internal lawyer or legal person that dealt 
with the matter in your department are you able to indicate what kind of 
seniority he had or she had at the time? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The lawyer was at a Deputy Director 
20 
level Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A Deputy Director level? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes and the lawyer, the State Law 
Advisors in the office of the Premier was at the DDG level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deputy Director General level? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 133 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Deputy Director General level yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the difference was quite huge. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It was quite big Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the lawyer that you had internally was it 
somebody who was an admitted attorney, an admitted advocate, was it 
somebody who had practiced, who had not practiced or – do you know? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know how long he had been or she had been a 
10 
lawyer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Normally Chair although I will not be 
precise the people that will be serving in government would be those 
that are fresh from school. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   So I would not be familiar with their 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The particular one, but you – but it is fair to say that 
person would have been quite junior? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  My concern therefore is why as head of 
department you would have seen it as fine to rely on the advice of such 
a junior person for such an important project involving millions of 
Rands and not go to an experienced lawyer, maybe the State Law 
Advisors who were quite senior? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 134 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair even though I would not have 
followed the process at some stage you have an understanding that if a 
lawyer does not feel comfortable they consult, that’s what I know, a 
number of times they will tell me that we are busy consulting, 
sometimes they will consult senior advocates and so on and so on.  I 
was not sure in this case if they would have done the consultation or 
not, but my belief is that if they feel uncomfortable with any activity 
they do consultation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that presents me with a difficulty Mr 
Thabethe because it says to me you may have consulted somebody who 
10 
may have left varsity just a few years before, had not practiced law, 
and that person may not even have consulted any more experienced 
lawyer and you gave this person this very important agreement, they 
looked at it, just because they did not convey to you that they were 
uncomfortable you were comfortable.   
 
I would have thought that the important thing would not be 
whether the lawyer is comfortable, it is whether you, the client, is 
comfortable that this person is the type of person who has got the 
knowledge, experience and expertise that would make you comfortable 
to base your decisions on his or her advice.   
20 
 
Do you understand where I am coming from? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so in other words I should not say look at this 
agreement tell me if it is fine and if the person says I think it is fine 
and does not indicate any discomfort then I am very comfortable.   No, I 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 135 of 187 
 
want to know about how much does that person know in this field for 
me to be able to be comfortable.   
 
If I do not know how much the person knows I have no grounds 
to be comfortable, but if I speak to other people whose opinion I trust 
in the area and they say no, no, so and so is a very good lawyer, he is 
experienced in these matters, he has been around for a long time, then 
you might have comfort, or if you know more about that person, but 
where it is somebody you don’t know, you just know they are in the 
department, you know they very junior, that you know, and this 
agreement relates to a very important project in the department and in 
10 
the Province, but you are happy to rely on their advice.  That is my 
difficulty. 
 
I would have thought that your judgment would have said this 
is a very important project, if I am going to sign agreement I must have 
advice from senior and experienced lawyers, do you want to comment 
on that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, thank you Chair.  I agree with 
you Chair, that would have been a good thing to do, in a number of 
instances we had referred some work, the lawyers have indicated that 
they would need an external lawyer to assist them.   
20 
 
Then I developed this understanding that the lawyer would 
indicate to you if I am not comfortable with this I need additional help.  
A number of them where they have been comfortable we proceeded with 
that, so I trusted the judgment that they would then provide to me, but I 
agree with you I could have also used my own judgment. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 136 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you accept, don’t you, that looking back it was 
wrong to entrust something so important or to base your decisions to 
sign or not to sign this agreement on the basis of the advice of 
somebody so junior and somebody whose experience and expertise 
really in the legal field you did not know? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I agree Chair, I already accepted it 
when the State Law Advisors advised me in this regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Thank you Chairman.  Mr Thabethe you 
were in the process of giving an explanation on the deviation, just as 
10 
an opening gambit, there are a number of issues that arise. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    But you were about to start explaining 
the deviation. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Yes, go ahead sir. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Because this practice Chair was not 
only the practice in the Vrede Dairy project, this was the general 
practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, please remind me what practice you are 
20 
referring to, I may have missed something? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   The one that I want to explain Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, alright. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 137 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Money gets allocated to the 
Department to provide support to farmers, we ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I’m sorry Mr Thabethe, if you could just, 
we know that there are different sources, it will help us if you are 
specific about which monies would come for farmers, just with each 
allocation just explain where it comes from, sorry to interrupt. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   We – there were three kinds of 
allocations Chair, the Provincial equitable share, which was termed 
Mahoma Mobung, would be allocated to the Department for farmer 
support.    
10 
 
From the National Department of Agriculture we were receiving 
conditional grant.  The one called CASP which was the Conditional 
Agricultural Support Programme – Comprehensive Agricultural Support 
Programme.  And there was another conditional grant which was called 
Ilima Letsema.   These two were part of the DoRA allocations that will 
then come with conditions to us.  A very strict condition that will be 
earmarked only for the benefit of the farmer.  We would then in the 
Department allocate this money under transfers. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Why would you allocate it under 
transfers?  I do not want you to lose your train of thought sorry but it is 
20 
important for us to understand that. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Thank you Chair.  We – we had 
allocated the money before in the Department under transfers and we 
will then receive the money as approved by National and the Province 
then we transfer the money directly to the beneficiary to implement the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 138 of 187 
 
project.  I do not want to go into details but we struggled.  We moved to 
the next as advised.  We allocated the money… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay – okay I am sorry Mr Thabethe I do not want to 
– you to go too far without me understanding this part.  There were 
funds that you would receive from different sources or maybe from one 
source. There were funds that you received from Treasury and were 
there funds that you received also from the National Department of 
Agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The – Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Generally speaking. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja there were three… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sources. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Sources of the funds of support of 
farmers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in particular funds provided to give support to 
farmers? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja three sources. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Three sources yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is the ones I have mentioned Treasury, National 
20 
Treasury, Provincial Treasury and National Department of Agriculture? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No only two Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only two? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The two will come from the National 
Department of Agriculture. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 139 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The two conditional grants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And the one that comes from the 
Provincial Treasury comes from the Equitable Share. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – but those are the three sources you talk 
about? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Those are the three sources Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And you were saying that you would 
receive those funds and put them under transfer, is that correct? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes as we receive them they already 
come – they already get allocated to specific projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So you know when you receive the 
lump sum you know where it should go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  So originally then as we receive the 
money we will then disperse it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And send it to the project for 
20 
implementation.  It means from us – from transferred we send the  
money to the account of the beneficiary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And our responsibility will be then to 
assist the beneficiary. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 140 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in this – in this instance when you say 
beneficiary you not talking about a person or a farmer you are talking 
about the project for which it is intended or not really? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is both Chair.  In some instances 
the project will be registered in the name of a company or a CC or 
whatever form, a trust and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Entity ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  In some instances the project 
will be registered in the name of an individual farmer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Okay thank you. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted clarification I interrupted you.  You may 
proceed unless Ms Gcabashe wants to ask something before but I know 
interrupted you while you were continuing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No please continue. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thank you Chair.  We – we had 
problems with that because the beneficiaries were not sticking to the 
business plan.  Then we had discussions with Provincial Treasury.  We 
changed the gazetting from transfers to goods and services.  Now 
hence yesterday I was saying there is a difference between transfers 
20 
and – we allocated the money to goods and services.  Goods and 
services… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But can I – yes you are about to explain 
what those are. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Goods and services then meant 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 141 of 187 
 
to us to say the Department is responsible for the procurement process, 
you cannot transfer the money.  If you want to spend the money you 
have to spend the money through the Department.  It means you must 
do the project on behalf of the farmer and hand it over to the farmer.  It 
means you must advertise a tender.  If say for an example you had to 
build a dairy for this farmer then you must go and advertise a tender, 
you must get bidders and then they must go and erect the – on the 
farmers land.  Now once you have completed you must enter that into 
the asset register.  It is a requirement.  Any money you have spent in 
government under goods and services it must go into your asset 
10 
register.  Now you have a problem of having an asset in a land that 
does not belong to government.  You have that problem number 1.  And 
after you have done so you have to dispose that asset to the farmer 
and you cannot dispose it as a government because you have gazetted 
this money under goods and services it means you have to dispose 
these assets any – any asset that has a certain amount of value you 
have to dispose it through the legislature.  You go through Treasury 
and it goes to the legislature.  Looking at the number of projects that 
we were giving support to the farmers we felt that it – it gave us a 
problem because we had a very huge asset register of assets that did 
20 
not belong to government.  Secondly we had a problem on the grant 
itself.  Because the grant was saying this is not meant for the benefit of 
government.  So you cannot take money that has been given to a 
farmer and you put it in the asset register of government that you 
cannot do that.  Then we move back to transfer given those challenges 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 142 of 187 
 
that we had.  You cannot register – it was a condition of the grant.  You 
cannot register that asset in government.  But if you have registered 
that money under goods and services you cannot escape from not 
registering that asset under government and then dispose it to the 
beneficiary.  We had a huge problem with the audit after we have done 
– because the reconciliation became a problem.  You go to a private 
farmer, you have bought a tractor for this farmer and this thing is in 
your asset.  You go there you arrive the farmer has sold the tractor.  
Now that is in your asset but you have told the farmer this is your 
tractor.  He has sold the tractor and you cannot account on the tractor 
10 
because it is not – you were not in control of that tractor.  So we 
decided we have a problem again.  We have to go back to transfers.  
Because transfers actually says this money is not yours.  We are giving 
it to you to pass it onto the farmer. But this time we are not going to 
transfer the money to the farmer.  We will develop an agreement as a 
Department and find service providers who will assist the farmer.  
Because if you give the money to the farmer the money does not get 
spent what we want to do.  We will get a service provider that we will 
then – we will implement the project on behalf of the farmer but we 
protect the farmer by us as government signing an agreement with the 
20 
service provider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say to the service provider we are appointing 
you but actually you are acting on behalf of the farmer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 143 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now we – we sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you appreciate what I am finding tricky. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I hear you Chair.  I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You appoint – you appoint representatives of the 
farmers on their behalf. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  But they – they sign an agreement 
with us that they agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You make sure they give you the mandate to… 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The mandate yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We sign the agreement with the 
service provider but they sign an agreement with us to say we are 
agree that you appoint somebody to implement the project or not now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then we had the control 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now that is what we did.  Now coming 
now to – to this process.  Now all the other projects that we had done 
20 
we as government we had been advertising and saying we need 
implementing agents to assist our farmers.  Then they would tender and 
then we will then go back to the farmers and say we have the following 
implementing agent.  Implementing agent A we believe we can put in 
this district to assist the farmers of this district and so on and so on.  
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 144 of 187 
 
We will then transfer the money to the implementing agent then they do 
the work and they report.  We will not transfer all of it we will transfer it 
so that we also safeguard ourselves that if anything happens to this 
implement agent we have not lost all the money.  So they will and do 
the implementation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But can you pause just there please Mr 
Thabethe.  The process you are describing would have followed on in 
terms of the SCM Policy in that there would be a bid process, a 
competitive process etcetera, etcetera. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The – Chair the money that is 
10 
allocated under transferred does not require that process.  Once the 
money is under transfers you pass it on.  You do not go through a 
bidding process.  That is the allocation.  It is a transfer it is not – you 
are not supposed to go through the bidding process.  So you receive a 
transfer.  It comes with the condition that it is for this particular project 
you transfer the money to that particular project.  We – we had – why 
we did that it was because of the previous experience.  We then – we 
came up with a system that will help us to make sure that this money 
goes to the intended purpose. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Again I am going to ask you to pause.  So 
20 
you are here referring strictly to CASP grants and to Ilima grants.  Are 
those the ones you are illustrating now?  Where it would come in on – 
with certain conditions and you simply pass it on? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  Also the money that we had 
received from the Provincial Equitable Share we gazetted it under 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 145 of 187 
 
transfers because our understanding is that it will serve exactly the 
same purpose.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which – which part of the PFMA/Treasury 
Regulations permitted you to gazette it?  I understand the first two the 
CASP and the Ilima.  The third one I do not quite understand.  It is in 
terms of which particular regulation that you could do that or provision 
in the PFMA? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair the allocation of the budget. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh I see. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is done by the Department. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You decide how much you want to put 
where as you present your budget to Treasury. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it is the broader exercise of how you 
are allocating your budget as a department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  As a department that is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So – excuse me.  Let me go back to the two I think 
they are grants Ilima and CASP. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you saying that Supply Chain Management 
prescripts do not apply to those ones because you are not procuring 
services or goods, is that what you are saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so – okay so for those ones those two types 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 146 of 187 
 
those goes to a transfer – I guess when you say transfer it means 
transfer account? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is an item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is an item oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair where you then gazette the 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So – so it is not your money? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are supposed to transfer it to somebody? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To somebody that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay and you say in regard to that Supply Chain 
Management does not apply? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the checks and balances that relate to 
that type of transfer the CASP and the Ilima transfer is that the 
National Department monitors and can withdraw? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Those grants. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  What – hence 
20 
in the past we had problems.  When the National Department comes 
and say we have allocated to the Province the approval of these 
projects we want to go and see them.  You said to us you were 
supposed to buy a tractor, you were supposed to put a windmill or 
fences whatever that was approved can we go and see.  Then when you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 147 of 187 
 
had done a transfer you go there and you do not find those things. You 
cannot explain.  Then we said but the problem is that we should have 
put controls in place and those were the controls that we had put in 
place to make sure that the money that has been invested we are under 
control we will be able to get those assets.  And I can confirm Chair it 
improved.  We were able even when the Portfolio Committee comes and 
say how far have you gone with your [indistinct] can you show us those 
projects we were able to show. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But let us then talk about the DoRA 
allocation that would come into Province the vote of the Department of 
10 
Agriculture and Rural Development would be Vote 11, am I right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now from Vote 11 you would then have to 
budget and decide on where you are allocating what you have? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair by the time the DoRA 
allocation from National Department comes you – we as a department 
on the Province we had already gone there and presented the projects 
and the names and the amounts.  If then there was what we called the 
National Assessment Panel at National. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Now the National Assessment Panel 
will then approve those projects. Then money will be allocated to the 
province as per those approved projects.  If the value…… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can .. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  If the value of the projects that we 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 148 of 187 
 
had submitted and got approved was equivalent to R100 million we will 
then receive the R100 million.  We would then have gazetted that 
money under transfers in the Province. So when the MEC goes and 
reads his budget speech he will then be able to say under farmer 
support we have this amount of money and this is the list of the 
projects that we are going to support.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now the intention of Section 217 of The 
Constitution coming down to PFMA Treasury Regulations as we 
discussed yesterday is to introduce equity into the system. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV 
LEAH 
GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
Transparency 
into 
the 
system, 
competitiveness in terms of just making sure there is value for money. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  With DoRA grant help me with that one?  
Because I think I more or less grasp the conditional grants.  How – with 
the DoRA Equitable portion grant how do you monitor the manner in 
which that money is spent? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair when that budget gets released 
you already know to whom is it going.  So there is no competition 
because if the money gets allocated to us and we know from this total 
20 
amount of this budget so much is for that project for so and so, this one 
is for so and so.  We received it and under strict conditions from 
National that you can only use it for the intended purpose.  Now that – 
that is what we have.  Now the correct thing to do is just to pass it on 
to the project and to the owner but we wanted to make sure that it is 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 149 of 187 
 
used for the purpose intended.  So we were putting systems in place to 
make sure that this money get used for the intended purpose. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Describe any one of those systems that 
you are referring to?  To help – just to illustrate the point. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The one that I have explained Chair 
was that we will then identify an implementing agent.  We will appoint 
an implementing agent then make the implementing agent implement 
the project on behalf of the farmer and the Department will then be 
satisfied to be able to report to say yes indeed this money was 
allocated to this particular farmer and this is what has been achieved. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am back at my issue that I raised with 
you yesterday in a different context about form over substance.  The 
form being you have done your part.  You have appointed an 
implementing agent.  You have transferred the money to the 
implementing agent.  And this is a very good example the agreement 
with Estina. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They were an implementing agent.  We 
can deal with the other issues later. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But in this agreement by way of example 
you then have sub-contractors who can be employed. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What control would the Department have 
over not only the appointment of sub-contractors but the payment of 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 150 of 187 
 
those sub-contractors?  The verification of their invoices etcetera, 
etcetera?  You see Mr Doctor Masiteng described this as a something 
similar to a turnkey project. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain I just want to understand 
the monitoring how you know you got value for money from that 
implementing agent you appointed and that your beneficiaries are 
satisfied customers of the Department? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja thank you Chair.  We have to 
receive monthly reports from the implementing agent in terms of the 
10 
progress.  We normally say – we say to them you must use our systems 
but we cannot take those systems into government.  We say before you 
buy do three quotations.  Do compares do not just go to a shop and say 
because they want a tractor I am therefore buying this tractor and I am 
delivering to the farmer.  We say to them do your due diligence.  When 
we do our monitoring we come in and we say you have bought this 
tractor the farmer where are the quotes that you have got?  Then they 
will be able then to provide it to us and say we have done a quotation 
here and here hence we have bought this tractor. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In the Department whose job was it to 
20 
monitor that expenditure?  I know it could not be the HOD because he 
sits right at the top? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  On the ground whose function was it to 
monitor that expenditure? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 151 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That becomes the responsibility of the 
Chief Director but he has got extension officers on the ground that 
works directly with the project that interact on a daily basis with the 
implementing agent to assist the implementing agents to make sure that 
projects gets delivered.  So on a daily basis when they do not – they go 
and do quotations the extension officer is there; is able to advise both 
the farmer and the implementing agent.  In certain instances for an 
example if you are to acquire cattle for the farmer they also bring the 
farmer along to look at the cattle that they are buying for him if he 
agrees he says yes these are the cattle I want then the procurement 
10 
process goes on.  So there has been checks and balances on the 
ground done by the extension officer and also the Chief Director has 
that responsibility.  Because he is responsible – there are directors in 
the district, extension officers and then the Chief Director overseas the 
whole process.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I know I am moving forward rather rapidly 
I am still going to come back to the technicality around the deviation.  
But can I debate this checks and balances issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well hang on Ms Gcabashe I also still want to stay on 
these. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we call it deviation maybe we do not call it 
deviation that he was talking about.  Let me ask some questions before 
you move on.  When you said in respect of the two I think grants CASP 
grants and the other one. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 152 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ilima Letsema Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ilima ja.  When you said you would then – you would 
get a service provider who would then effectively assist the farmer but 
you get an agreement from the farmer that a mandate that you can 
appoint the service provider.  That was in regard to Ilima and CASP or 
did I misunderstand? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It was with regard to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That example did it apply to that or did it apply to 
more than those two? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It applied to all the three. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the three? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now the third one being the one you get from 
Treasury. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The one – that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that the one you said is from DoRA is DoRA? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  DoRA just remind me I – the DoRA. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is not the DoRA one Chair.  The 
DoRA is the two that comes from National. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It is from the division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the DoRA one this does not apply to the DoRA this 
example does not apply to the DoRA? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It applies to all of them. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 153 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To all of them. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  To all of them but the one that comes 
from the Province is the Provincial Equitable Share. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Equitable Share. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja it is not the one that comes from 
National. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now were you saying that the Supply Chain 
Management prescripts and policies and procurement policies apply 
when you are going to use the Equitable the one from the Equitable 
Share but not to those that come from CASP and Ilima and DoRA is that 
10 
what you are saying or have I misunderstood? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  No Chair.  What applies is where you 
have gazetted it.  It does not matter where it comes from but when you 
do your budget gazetting where did you allocate the money? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you talk about gazetting. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – I take it that means publish what you said in a 
government gazette, is that right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  The MEC has – 
you submit that the MEC goes and present the budget Vote and then 
20 
the legislature must pass it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And then it goes to the gazette. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in his budget vote the MEC would indicate what 
would fall under transfers? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 154 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say if funds fall under transfers then 
procurement prescripts do not apply? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you saying? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja that was – that was correct until 
April 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then National Treasury released a 
new instruction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Instruction Note. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And saying actually does apply. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The new instruction notes was then 
saying this is now the way it has changed now since May 2018 but they 
have said it was retrospective from 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  And then that has now changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  There are systems that they have 
20 
been put in place now to say even if the money has been put under 
transfer these are the following processes that you need to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now what is it that excluded the requirement for 
procurement procedures from application if funds that were going to be 
used fell under transfers where – what is it that was the basis for the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 155 of 187 
 
view that if funds have been put under transfers then procurement 
processes do not apply? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair there - there were kinds of 
enterprises that you would not go and bid for.  Like when you transfer 
money to a farmer.  Like for example you transferring Government 
money to an NGO to implement a process for you.  You will gazette that 
money under transfer and - and you note which NGO you want to - to 
transfer the money. 
So you will not go and publish a tender to say I - I need - I 
need somebody to come and bid for this money for this particular 
10 
purpose.  You had already - it is - it is for example like you have got - I 
- I want to use another example … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well obviously … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you invite bids when you have not made any 
decision … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About who the person is that you want to be involved 
in the project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if you already know then going - doing bids 
even if the procurement processes are applicable would be just going 
through the motions? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is our understanding sir 
because as - as the money came we - we had already approved 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 156 of 187 
 
projects to say this money is going to this particular farmer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes; but if you are going to appoint an implementing 
agent even in the example of a farmer.  You - you might - the funds - if 
you are going to transfer the funds to the farmer you might not be 
buying goods or services from the farmer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you are going to appoint an implementing agent 
who is going to do certain things in order for something to be 
successful.  You are going to be getting services.  Is it not? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair there - there is no direct benefit 
10 
from Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why do you appoint the agent then … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If - if you - if there is no benefit for - for you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because our previous experience of 
giving the money directly to the farmer we had experienced problems.  
So we had to come with a - a solution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why do you not leave it to the farmer to appoint 
whoever they want to appoint?  Why do you insist that you must be the 
ones who - who appoint? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair exactly the problem of 
accountability.  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you get a benefit or do you not get a benefit 
from the agent? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I - I - direct - the department does not 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 157 of 187 
 
get any benefit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you can do without them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We can do without them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there would be no problem? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  There will be problems Chair because 
you are not going to - to have a project that we intend … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is the position not that you - you want farmers to 
be assisted in a certain way.  You want to assist the farmers actually 
yourself. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That - that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Indeed under a certain regime you could have 
personnel in your department that you can send and say go and assist 
these farmers to be successful with what they are doing and you pay 
those people yourselves. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one regime in which you - you could do this 
but another regime is that you get somebody from outside the 
Government who has the skills that you believe are necessary in order 
to make the farmers successful.  So you - you say this person has got 
good skills.  So this person must be - must provide - must provide the 
20 
assistance and is the position not that you pay them for their services? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Chair - Chair you are correct that 
we had personnel in the department which we have used to assist the 
farmer.  The only difference is that if you do that then you must gazette 
the money under goods and services.  Then (intervenes). 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 158 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why do you not want to do that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then we had the problem Chair of 
having to register those assets you have bought for the farmer into your 
asset register. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It maybe that we might need to - to look at this later 
on much more but as things stand from what you have said to me.  It 
does seem that you have a project which you want to be successful and 
you need certain services in order for it to be successful and you bring 
in an agent.  You call them an implementing agent.  They - they 
implement your project and unto the one who pays them. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You pay them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why - what do you pay them for? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair, we - we transfer the money for 
them to implement the project.  It is - it is not like we are paying them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you - you have something that you want them to 
do … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is providing certain services … 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you transfer the money from which they get paid. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair.  They get paid - even if it 
is them or the farmer has appointed somebody else to come and 
implement.  That payment still happens.  Whoever you have appointed 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 159 of 187 
 
to come and do the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  You still do the payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We might have to deal with it - at some other 
time.  Ms Gcabashe let me allow you to move to the area that you 
wanted to move to. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I was actually going 
to deal with some of the issues … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That you have been dealing with but that 
10 
is fine.  I still have more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So the first one Mr Thabethe relates 
to the question of goods and services and where that asset sits if you 
are going to comply with the SCM Policy. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us take the example one of the 
witnesses may have mentioned it or I - I might have read about this.  
Let us take the example of the Free State Development Corporation. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am - I am sorry Ms Gcabashe.  We forgot to mention 
something.  We have arranged to proceed - continue until 5 o’ clock.  I 
take it you have no problem Mr Thabethe with this. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I just wanted to mention that because ordinarily 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 160 of 187 
 
people expect that we would - we would stop at four.  So we will 
continue until 5 o’ clock.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman and you will correct 
me in my interpretation because this is how I understood the situation.  
So you - you have the Free State Development Corporation.  We call it 
the FDC.  Taking over the running of the Vrede Dairy Farm.  I know 
there is a lot we are still going to discuss but allow me to use this 
example. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The assets that sit on an and at that dairy 
10 
farm who do those then belong to because as I understand your 
evidence they would not belong to the department the goods and 
services.  So those cattle, the feed, the machinery, the equipment FDC 
is compelled - my word - to register those items as FDC items but they 
do not belong to the FDC. 
Is that not a problem in itself in - in not having a way of 
dealing with those goods and services as the department - as the 
department that would own them? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  We - we would not owe them Chair 
because of the conditions of the grant.  So you cannot deviate from the 
20 
condition of the grant because the condition of the grant says the 
beneficiary of all assets that comes from this allocation is the farmer.  
So you would not then take these assets and pay - the condition says if 
you do that then you must repay the money back because the 
department has benefited. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 161 of 187 
 
It is not intended for the benefit of the State.  It is intended 
for the benefit of the farmer.  So you would not take those assets and 
register them in the asset register of the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  However if you had used part of the 
provincial allocation to capitalise the project.  So I accept your 
explanation for (indistinct).  If you had used other money to capitalise 
the project that money is then used to buy cattle and tractors etcetera.  
Those things would normally be called goods and services. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who owns - and I suppose I am also 
10 
looking at the context of their being no beneficiaries really for the 
Estina Project - who owns those items Mr Thabethe between the time 
that they are purchased and the time the beneficiaries are ultimately 
registered formally so as beneficiaries? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair hence the National Department 
of Agriculture makes it a condition that before they release the money 
you must provide them with the list of beneficiaries.  That is the 
requirement.  They need to know as they release the money it is 
intended for the following people.  Then we will - they - they have a 
specific requirement to say we need the names. 
20 
We need their ID numbers so that as they release the money 
then they know to whom it belongs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the question was from the time they are 
purchased to the time they - I think - given to the beneficiary who is the 
owner.  Now you - you from the perspective of lawyers they may be 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 162 of 187 
 
thinking a lot of things arising from that question but I think you are 
supposed to just answer it as a non-lawyer.  What would be your 
understanding at a factual level?  Who would claim rights to that - to 
them during that period? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The farmer is the owner Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In circumstances where you have an 
implementing agent are you calling that person the farmer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
No 
- 
no 
Chair. 
 
The 
- 
the 
implementing agent is not the owner of the asset.  His job is to 
10 
implement the project on behalf of the farmer.  Hence we - we appoint 
the implementing - so we he is not the owner of the asset. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - I hear you and I will think about what 
you are saying.  Just to digest and - and try and understand it.  I will 
grapple with it because I know I can come back and ask again where I 
still do not have clarity but can I ask a related question?  You see the 
difficulty with implementing agents is that it is very difficult - it is very 
difficult to monitor them closely because they are the persons who you 
transfer the lump sum to.  Am I right? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The lump sum is then used to pay not only 
for goods.  I will call those the cattle, the tractors etcetera but for 
services as well.  Where those services are inflated what remedy do 
you have?  How do you monitor the payment of monies for services that 
have been inflated?  Now you being the department of course. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 163 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I am - I am trying to think Chair 
of - of services because there - there - a service could be something 
that you want somebody to come and - and do - soil samples and the 
person comes on the farm and - and does soil samples and then the 
person invoices you to say this is what I want you to pay me for the 
samples that I have done and this is what - and these are your soil 
samples. 
Then - then the - the implementing agent pays the person for 
- for that service.  If I were a farmer and somebody comes to my farm 
and - and invoices me for soil samples I will have an indication an 
10 
understanding that but I have never seen soil samples this expensive.  
Then I will be able to say but there is something not right here.  These 
soil samples are too expensive. 
So that - that is my understanding that I have.  That if you 
inflate then it will be no.  That this is too expensive. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Well let us go to a real example and again 
I am still skirting around the whole Vrede Dairy issue.  We - we will get 
there.  If you go to the reference bundle page 1-3-7-5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A or B? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh.  It is D.  It is the last one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  D? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja, D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Doris. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are you there? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I am - I am trying to find it Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 164 of 187 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No - no problem.  It is D for Donald.  You 
have got it? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  I have got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you go to page 1-3-7-5.  You have that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  I have got it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will read it in a minute but can you 
also page across to 1-3-7-8 and then keep your finger on both, if you 
can keep them both there open.  I have just put my fingers between the 
pages to keep both open. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1-3-7-5. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And 1-3-7-8. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I will go from one to the other. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You recognise of course 1-3-7-8? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  I see it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You - you see your signature on 1-3-7-5? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  1-3-7-8 yes I see it Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Maybe we should just start there 
because it is your document and say that this document was the 
20 
Confirmation of Completion of Phase 1 of the Project … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In relation to the Vrede Dairy Farm? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And what you have here I think it is better 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 165 of 187 
 
to read this into the record just to be absolutely accurate.  Is you - you 
write on 18 January 2013 to Estina (Pty) Ltd in Vrede. 
“Subject:  Confirmation of Completion of Phase 1 of 
the Project.  Reference:  Contract signed between 
the department and Estina dated July 2012.  We 
refer to the above contract signed between the 
department and Estina with regard to setting up of 
an integrated diary project in Vrede Phumelela 
Municipality.  We are pleased to confirm that we 
have been receiving regularly monthly and quarterly 
10 
reports from Estina and are satisfied with the 
progress made so far.  With regard to the 
obligations of Estina for completion of Phase 1 of 
the Project by December, the 31 s t 2012 we are also 
pleased to confirm that all the obligations as 
required by the contract have been met as per 
details below.” 
So you set out the details below.  Estina obligations for First 
Phase.  So you have a number of items on the left hand column one to 
nine.  Then you have the obligation that rested with Estina in the next 
20 
column and then on the far right hand side you have got remarks.  Who 
makes these remarks on the far right hand side Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair - Chair these remarks on the 
right should be remarks of the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Huh-uh.  So you - you would have if not 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 166 of 187 
 
prepared this you would have read this because you signed this 
document? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What you have said here is in terms of 
land acquisition - this is January the 18 t h 2013. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your remark is: 
“Land has been registered at the Deeds Office.” 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Factually what had been registered at the 
10 
Deeds Office?  Can I give you the context just to remind you because 
you have not looked at these documents in a while?  Unless you know - 
you know what - you know it anyway? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes I know Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  Then let me listen. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes.  The registration was the lease 
agreement. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The lease agreement between? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Between the - the department and 
Estina. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  We will come back to that when we 
deal with the Vrede issues.  Second: 
“Environmental impact assessment.” 
Please read the entry. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE: 
 
“Environmental 
impact 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 167 of 187 
 
assessment.” 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then on the right hand side. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It says: 
“Applied and confirmation received from EDTEA.” 
Which is the Department of Environmental Affairs - Economic, 
Tourism and Environmental Affairs.  I am sorry. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
What 
is 
meant 
by 
applied 
and 
confirmation? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair my - my understanding of 
applied and confirmation it means the - the environmental impact 
10 
assessment has - has been registered. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What does registration mean?  Does it 
mean it has been conducted and concluded or that simply application 
has been filed to do an EIA? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Applied and confirmation received, it 
means it - it has been - it has been done by the company that was 
appointed and it has been tabled to the relevant authority that needs to 
say yes or no. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that is the confirmation that you 
await? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But there is no further work to be done 
unless of course there are adverse comments from the regulatory 
authority. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair.  Either they say 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 168 of 187 
 
no the information is incomplete.  We need one, two, three or no we 
decline or yes we agree. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  Then the feasibility study we will - 
which we will talk about in greater detail when we find time.  That had 
been received by the department. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now we referred to this yesterday and 
said as - on our records there is the October 2012 feasibility study. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that the one you know about? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is - that is what we when we 
were talking we referred to is as pre-feasibility study. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Oh. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Because there was then the second 
one which was detailed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What is the date of the second one? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just roughly because the only one I have 
seen in the bundles is the one of October 2012. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Is it - is the small one or the big one 
20 
Chair because they … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  This is actually important. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can we just find it for you and ask you to 
look at it? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 169 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because we are going to be talking about 
what monies were paid … 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For these services that were rendered. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My apologies Chair.  We will find it in a 
minute.  Let us continue while my colleagues look for it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will come back to it in a minute. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Let us go to the next item. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The water reticulation, tell us what that is 
about in the - just read - if you can read the entry on the right hand 
side. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is the permission Chair that you 
get to - it is - it is your water rights that you receive to be able to use 
water. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And who would be applying for those? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  The - the farm applies for - for it and 
then you then give a copy to the municipality that you have got the 
rights. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So in this instance the implementing 
agent would have applied for these. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 170 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  (Intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact I am - I think I have seen it as a 
term in the contract. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then the next item is: 
“Include …” 
Thank you. 
“Include 
identifying 
beneficiaries 
in 
Agri-BEE 
entity.” 
Please read what is on the right hand side. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair can I ask to repeat? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Item number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she is asking you to read what is written on the 
right hand column on item six where it says: 
“Include 
identifying 
beneficiaries 
in 
Agri-BEE 
entity.” 
Then there is something written under remarks.  That is what 
she is asking you to read. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  It says: 
“Done.” 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please explain “done” to the Chairman. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  “Done” it means we - we have the 
beneficiaries and the Agri-BEE company has been registered which is 
Zayna trading as Mohuma Mobung. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, but the beneficiary - this is in 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 171 of 187 
 
January 2013. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And the beneficiaries had not been 
registered yet as at January, the 18 t h 2013.  You had the list but you 
certainly had not told them what their allocations were or anything like 
that.  That is the - the substantive issue I keep raising. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  That - that is correct Chair.  Let 
me - let me go back.  You - you remember that it what we wanted to do 
but we were advised by the State Law Advisors not to do it at that time 
(intervenes). 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What was their reasoning?  What 
explanation did they give you? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Chair when - when we were advised 
was that the - the beneficiaries would get into the entity as we 
complete the project.  We should not do it before the project is 
complete because there is nothing to handover to them.  We are still in 
the process of construction. 
We should know them, who they are but then we will enter 
them into the - into the entity because you will remember that originally 
we - we even wanted that it should be the - the company that signs the 
20 
agreement because the intention Chair was eventually also disposed 
the land to them through the Land Reform Program.  So that the 
projects becomes entirely theirs. 
So we - we were advised not to proceed in that process.  To 
register it under the Government.  The land first to become State land.  
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 172 of 187 
 
We implement the project.  Once completed, we then transfer them into 
the entity which is the - the farmers’ holding company.  That - that is 
what I understood I was advised to do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But would it not have been more correct 
than to say something - you know we like saying work in progress when 
something is being done but has not been completed.  There could be a 
better - better way of phrasing it.  Would that not be more accurate 
because done means you know I have delivered on that particular 
milestone? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Yes Chair because what remained 
10 
would be paperwork to put the names in because what we had asked 
them to do.  It has been done.  What remained was our responsibility.  
Remember we are writing this to them and say what we had asked you 
to do has been done.  What remains became our responsibility to do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I - can I just debate that with you for one 
minute?  What had been done?  This is the evidence that has been 
tendered here at the Commission.  What had been done is that the 
department 
had been 
to Thembalihle and collected 
a 
list of 
beneficiaries.  Then they had also appointed a committee of three …  
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
Who 
would 
be 
representing 
the 
beneficiaries.  Estina did not do that work.  It is the department that did 
that work but why is it that when you tick done here it would appear as 
if you are now attributing the work that the department actually did to 
your implementing agent and then paying the implementing agent for it?  
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 173 of 187 
 
Have I got it wrong? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Ja.  Maybe Chair we would have 
needed the - the requirements that we said Estina should do in Phase 1 
because that will be very clear because this is in response to - to what 
we said they should do. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ja. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:  Then once they have done what we 
have asked the to do, maybe this might not have been the details of 
what we had said they should do, then if we compare the then if we 
compare the two, then we will be able to say, but you gave them the 
10 
work that they did not do, that you did.  Because my understanding was 
that the identification of beneficiaries becomes the responsibility of the 
Department together with the Municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But you see, and this might just be my own 
question, item 6 doesn’t say identify beneficiaries, it says include 
identified beneficiaries in Agri BE entity, what did that mean, include 
them in the entity? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair that means you must then take 
the names of the beneficiaries into the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Make them Shareholders, make them directors, 
20 
make them – what does mean take them to the company? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The remark on the right-hand column, “done”, do 
you mean that you were saying it had been done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Hence Chair I was making the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 174 of 187 
 
request that we need to go back to the original obligation that was 
given, because this might not have been correctly captured, so that if 
we check if it was in line with what we gave them as an obligation. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well but here in this letter, in the left-hand column 
you’ve written – well above that those two columns you write Estina 
obligations for first phase and then you write at the top, obligation – 
well you write number and say obligation and then you’ve got number 1, 
2 3, 4, up to 9 and under obligation you have set out what the 
obligation is, the first one is land acquisition, so that means Estina had 
the obligation to acquire land.  Then under six, the obligation under six, 
10 
like all the other obligations must mean you are setting out Estina’s 
obligations for first phase and under six you are, in effect saying Estina 
had an obligation to include identified beneficiaries in Agri Bee entity 
and your remark on the right-hand column is, Estina had done that. So 
it is correct that one of Estina’s obligations for the first phase was to 
include identified in Agri BEE entity? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Hence Chair before I confirm on it, I 
would want to check the original obligation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman, I have found it, is in Bundle A 
it is the July agreement, so it’s reference Bundle A page 11 and then 
20 
there’s an Annexure as well Mr Thabethe on page 24, please indicate if 
that’s the document that you think will assist in clarifying this matter. 
Page 11 and its clause six of he agreement, of the July agreement. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this is not the…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It’s not the document that you are looking for. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 175 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes there’s the document that has 
the milestones and the phases. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and it’s not the form of agreement 
or…[intervention]. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s in a table form. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can I ask you to go to page 24 because 
this is the agreement that you signed in July of 2012, 5 t h and 7 t h of 
July. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair there is a document that we 
gave them, which in response a costing of all those activities was done, 
10 
that was the document I was looking for. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman we’ll find that, if not today 
we’ll deal with it next time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But coming back to the – your letter on page 1378 
are you able to say whether you were correct in that letter to reflect 
that one of Estina’s obligation for phase one was to include identified 
beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity or are you saying you are not sure you 
were correct in saying that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I don’t think I was correct Chair, 
because although the original intention of registering the company and 
20 
identifying the beneficiaries as complete but this process of including 
them in the shell company had not been achieved Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay had not been achieved? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Had not been achieved as we were 
advised differently by the State Law Advisors. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 176 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay so it’s a matter that will be dealt with once 
the document has been found. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    The next item is number eight, item 
number eight.  No actually we just skipped number seven, so number 
six said include identified beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity, number 
seven reads, 
 
“Set-up of Agri BEE entity and clarify roles of stakeholders, 
these being the Department the Agri BEE entity and Estina.  In the 
right-hand side, what’s your remark there Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair I think the one that I’ve been 
10 
referring to ha been item number seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh the one where you need a certain document 
where you need a certain document to answer. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   To answer that one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh so that means we can go back to number six? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes that’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh alright, so let’s go back to six then, is it correct 
then that one of Estina’s obligations for first – for the first phase was to 
include identified beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s correct Chair that we wanted 
20 
them to do that responsibility but it was ourselves that put it on hold, 
therefore the remark on the right is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That it was done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That is was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes now including them – so you still say including 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 177 of 187 
 
identified beneficiaries means what you said a few minutes ago? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay that had not been done? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No that’s true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because You had put it on hold? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Then we get to number eight, draw a 
project plan, in line with Estina proposals with milestones and timelines 
for phase two as approved by the Department. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair, that is actually 
the document that I’m looking for. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Now is that the project proposal or the 
project – or the business plan? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s a project plan with milestones 
and dates of each of the activities that should happen with a budget 
allocation to each item. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Then the last item, we’ll come back to 
you on that one as well, the last item, determine the dates for capital 
injection by Estina.  What’s the comment or remark on the right-hand 
20 
side? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair it says Estina has already 
commenced investment. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Could you explain that and this is as at 
January 18, 2013? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 178 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair, in the previous reports 
that we’ve been receiving on a monthly basis.  In the tables that we 
have been provided there were already indications of how much Estina 
has spent, they had already provided that to us, so hence they’ve 
already commenced. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    We can deal with this now or later, what 
Estina had spent in relation to what you had advanced or in relation to 
their own contribution of R228million? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   In relation to their own Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Okay we’ll explore that in due course. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well let’s – you say in your remark, Estina has 
already commenced investments and we know that one of the two 
things that you said you wanted Paras for, was direct investments. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you are talking about or investment 
being used for – in a different context here. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair they were already putting 
money into the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In what way? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   There was a phase in which they 
20 
were to do the implementation but that phase, dependent on the 
progress that we’ve been making, as the progress was moving then 
they then started their part in preparation with the investment that they 
had to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So they were spending their money to advance the 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 179 of 187 
 
project? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s what you mean? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you know by any chance, more or less, how 
much they may have spent by this time around by this time, January 
2013 or is that something that needs checking some documents? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair we have monthly reports of the 
amounts they had spent and going to those reports we will be able to 
see how much…[intervention]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What they had spent? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What’s your rough sense of what they may have 
spent by then bearing in mind what you had seen in the reports – in the 
monthly reports, obviously I’m not expecting you to be exact, I’m just, 
you know, wanting to have a sense from – are we talking about 
somebody who had spent some millions already by January 2013 or it 
was less than R100 000, less than R500 000, are you able to give me 
some sense on that without having to go look at the documents or is it 
something that would require you to look at the documents? 
20 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair I would need to go to the 
document, what I would want to mention here Chair is that we had 
discussed, I think, yesterday that  the Department wanted to make an 
advance payment which did not happen but the work on the ground 
continued.  The work on the ground that we were acknowledging had 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 180 of 187 
 
happened.  The Department had not spent money yet which we had 
intended to do.  The payment from the Department came later but what 
we had asked them was to say from this obligation you must 
differentiate from what you have done, which was supposed to have 
been done by us and what you have done which was supposed to have 
been done by you.  So that was clearly indicted in that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Can I interrogate your last statement, 
R30million was paid in or around July, if it’s not the 9 t h of July it’s the 
20 t h of July, do you agree with that? 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   2013? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    No 2012, the first R30million was paid in 
July of 2012, there was a shortfall of R84million to make up the 
R114million, would you agree with that? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   No Chair I think if you go back to the 
report of the investigation of Treasury they’ve raised that, that in the 
system the R30million was captured but never paid. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no the R84million was captured but 
never paid, the R30million was paid but the R84million – you’re correct 
if you were saying the R84million…[intervention].   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a page which might refresh his memory that 
you want him to refer him to or document? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    I must apologise Mr Chairman, and really 
Mr Thabethe I’m sorry I wasn’t going to be dealing with the monies now 
but my juniors are busy feeding me with – here we go, have two 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 181 of 187 
 
sources.  Mr Thabethe I have got actually more than I expected, I think 
the first one we should look at is reference Bundle B page 458 which is 
a BCT payment list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 458? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    458 Chairman, it’s in Bundle B, the 
reference bundle, but Bundle B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you found it Mr Thabethe? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I’m getting closer Chair, that’s 
correct Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    You will see you have at the top Estina, 
10 
the amount that was paid on the 14 t h of June 2012 was R30million are 
you convinced now or is there something you think is not quite right 
with the document I’m holding. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Exactly Chair, this is not the proof of 
payment, this is what gets approved so that you register the payment 
into the system, the proof of payment I a different document. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you are certain that it had not been – it wasn’t 
paid, all that we are looking for is proof but -  or is the position that 
you are doubtful that it was paid? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Until I’m proven otherwise Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja but your recollection is that it was not paid? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It wasn’t paid, that’s my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay but this kind of document, would this kind of 
document exist if the payment had not been made? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 182 of 187 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    It’s done before the actual payment was made? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   It’s done before the actual payment 
is made. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it may have been done in anticipation of 
payment? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then payment might not actually have followed? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    Chairman with your leave, we have 
divided the work that we’re doing on this stream, Mr Thabethe so we 
10 
have a related stream that we call, money flows, we have not put those 
documents before the Chairman because we’re still working with the 
broader concept of money flows.  However Chairman I’ve got a 
Standard Bank entry here from that stream of work, it’s just not in any 
of our bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but it exists. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I’m happy to show is and the entry to 
Mr Thabethe just so he can refresh his memory and understand, it’s 
highlighted Mr Thabethe, my colleague will bring it to you, don’t worry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s really just to assist you.  That 
what’s highlighted at the bottom, please read that at the bottom and we 
will place it before the Chairman, more appropriately next time we come 
in.  These are records that were summonsed from the banks and that’s 
just one of them? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 183 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja Chair, I may need to go back and 
do the re-check. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   This matter, did come out during the 
investigation, I think, by the Hawks.  We went to the systems of the 
Department, we were not able to find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That payment. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That payment and that’s why I say I 
will need to go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine because we are not finishing 
10 
today, I think your legal representatives with liaise with Ms Gcabashe if 
there is any document that the Commission is in position of that might 
assist in clarifying, in your own mind, what the position is. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I don’t know whether you want to 
keep that one…[intervention]. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Can I point to one more note Chairman 
we would like to take it back – can I just point you to one more entry 
which is a sundry payment advice, it may not be what you are looking 
20 
for in terms of confirmation, but this one, is found in – again reference 
Bundle B at page 654 – 654 reference Bundle B.  You will see that, 
that’s the  cash amount, if you look at the right-hand side R25 400 000 
and then another R4.6million signed off by yourself, you have a 
signature here, HOD.  Do you recall what this might have been about? 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 184 of 187 
 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair this is still a document in 
anticipation, that sundry payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Chair why I’m having a doubt is that 
– it’s because when this investigation was done the CFO, not the 
previous CFO, the new CFO was requested to go and check in the 
system and she came back and made a confirmation to them that she 
could not find such a payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She could not find that payment had been made? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Had been made yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you know whether she had gone to the bank 
to check or not, or she just gave that answer? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja but the system of the Department 
– because if you paid your system must…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes your system should be able to tell you. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Ja I’m not sure if they did go to the 
bank. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but the department system, indicated that – did 
not indicate that payment had been made? 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Yes hence I’m…[intervention]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’re hesitant to accept. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   I’m hesitating now to say, was this 
paid or not paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that’s fine, between now and the next time, if it is 
possible from your side you will try and see what you can get but you 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 185 of 187 
 
will get the cooperation form the Commission if there are any 
documents that could assist you to have clarity on the matter. 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman I’ve just consulted with the 
team and we’ll be able to bring those on Tuesday, we have – just to 
reassure you Mr Thabethe that the first R30million was paid then the 
R84million was entered but not paid until a later date when it was paid 
in three tranches, so I think we’re going to – when we come back, show 
you that the entire R114million, R30million plus R84million was in fact 
paid and we’ll show you the dates. 
10 
MR MBANA PETER THABETHE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and maybe what could be done is to make 
available to his legal representatives, on Monday those documents so 
that by the time we resume on Tuesday he has had time to reflect on 
them and consider them and is able to say, yes I agree there was 
payment or no I still don’t agree. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman I notice it’s a minute to five, I 
can continue with this on Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   If that’s the date you’ve decided we 
20 
should…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes on Monday we are going to have a witness who’s 
evidence belong to the Law Enforcement stream Mr [indistinct] and he 
may – he might not finish on Monday and might go – continue on 
Tuesday but I think if he does continue on Tuesday it will only be for a 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 186 of 187 
 
short, very short limited time but there’s a chance he might finish on 
Monday but now I remember that I already said in chambers we’ll start 
at half past eight.  The only thing is, that would be fine if we finished 
with Mr Nkasana on Monday, if we will not have finished and maybe 
he’s going to take another hour or two, it might not be fair to let you be 
here earlier and if we have to continue with him we will start earlier, 
that is Mr Nkasana, we will try and start earlier unless there’s 
something that I can’t think of now that will prevent us from doing so.  
So I think – I think we should say one, in the hope that we will finish Mr 
Nkasana’s evidence will be finished on Monday then we will continue on 
10 
Tuesday with Mr Thabethe’s evidence and in that event we will start at 
half past eight.  Should we not finish Mr Nkasana’s evidence on 
Monday, may I request that you keep in touch with, I think Mr Pretorius 
will be leading Mr Nkasana’s so that maybe we can indicate, I can 
indicate what time I think we would start with Mr Thabethe’s evidence 
and then you can be in tough with his legal representatives to say what 
time they really would need to be here so that they don’t drive all the 
way to be here half past eight only to find that we start at ten or 
something, is that fine? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s fine Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I take it, it’s fine with you as well, okay thank 
you.  Alright then we are going to stop at this stage Mr Thabethe and 
we will continue on Tuesday, we’ll work on the basis of half  past eight 
at this stage but Monday afternoon that might change if Mr Nkasana is 
going to go into Tuesday as well but your legal representatives will be 
16 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 146 
 
Page 187 of 187 
 
informed and then they’ll let you know.  Yes, okay we therefore adjourn 
for today and well resume on Monday but with a different witness, we 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 19 AUGUST 2019
