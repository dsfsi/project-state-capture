Page 4 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR SINGH:  Anoj Singh. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the

MR SINGH:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your

MR SINGH:  Yes I do. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated Mr Singh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson the documents that are 
of 
particular 
relevance 
to 
Mr 
Singh’s 
evidence 
are 
contained in Transnet Bundle 5(b) and 5(c) and that is 
Exhibit BB23. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And I have got 5(c) so I 
guess that is the one you start with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Singh good morning. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 5 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Good morning Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Could I ask you please you have 
these two bundles I take it in front of you.  Could you turn 
to Bundle 5(c) and go to page 1750.   
MR SINGH:  We using the black or red? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The black numbers yes.   
MR SINGH:  15? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1750.   
MR SINGH:  I am there Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now you will recall that at the last 
10 
sitting of your evidence you contended that Witness 3 had 
been spoon fed information about Knox Vault by someone 
within the commission and that that is how he came to say 
that he took you there.  Do you recall that evidence? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now what you find at page 1750 and 
further 
is 
an 
affidavit 
of 
Josiah 
Leonard 
he 
is 
an 
investigator at the commission and if I could take you to 
paragraph 8 at paragraph – sorry page 1752 he makes 
reference to your evidence at paragraphs 8,9 and 10 and 
20 
he explains then that he provided this affidavit in that 
context.  Could I ask you please to turn to page 1753 you 
will see there at paragraph 12 that Mr Leonard says that as 
part of his – of the on-going investigation procedure 
performed at Transnet he interviewed various drivers or 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 6 of 296 
 
CPO’s 
who 
were 
assigned 
to 
protect 
and 
transport 
members of Transnet executive management team during 
the period 2009 to 2018.  He then says at paragraph 13 
that on 29 April he interviewed Witness 3 for the first time.  
He says at paragraph 14 that Witness 3 informed us that 
he served as a driver and CPO for Mr Singh while being 
the GCFO of Transnet commencing in July 2014 until his 
secondment to Eskom. 
 
And at 15 Mr Leonard says that in addition to other 
matters Witness 3 informed us about – he told us that on 
10 
six or seven occasions after visits to the Gupta residence 
Mr Singh would instruct him to drive to Knox Vault across 
the road from the Killarney Mall. 
 
According to Witness 3 Mr Singh would take the bag 
that he collected from the Gupta residence (which he 
suspected contained cash) from the boot of the vehicle and 
go into the Knox Vault building. 
 
Mr Singh would return to the vehicle and Witness 3 
would notice that the bag was now empty.  He informed us 
that he suspected that Mr Singh had deposited the 
20 
contents in a safe at Knox Vault. 
 
Paragraph 16 it was during this interview with 
Witness 3 that anyone within or from the commission first 
became aware of Knox Vault and Mr Singh’s visits to Knox 
Vault. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 7 of 296 
 
 
17 – Witness 3 subsequently deposed to an affidavit 
setting out the abovementioned facts. 
 
So that was an interview on the 29 t h of April 2019.  
Mr Leonard goes on to say that based on the first 
consultation with Witness 3 the commission issues a 
summons to Knox Vault on 13 June 2019 in terms of which 
Knox Vault were required to provide the commission with 
records and documents relating to the rental of safety 
deposit boxes by specific individuals. 
 
Mr Singh was among the individuals whose records 
10 
were summonsed.   
 
Paragraph 19 on 20 June Knox Vault complied with 
the summons and produced the following customer records 
for Mr Singh. 
 
And they then listed as access records (customer 
visits, application form, additional box forms, tax invoices, 
cancellation 
forms, 
credit 
note 
and 
identification 
document). 
 
Over the page Mr Leonard goes on to say that the 
records received from Knox Vault are attached hereto 
20 
marked Annexure EPL1. 
 
According to the access records (customer visits) 
Mr Singh visited Knox Vault on 22 occasions between July 
2013 and August 2017.  Ten of these visits fall within the 
period that Witness 3 served as driver/CPO for Mr Singh. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 8 of 296 
 
 
22 - As mentioned above Witness 3 stated during 
the first interview with him on 29 April 2019 that he had 
escorted Mr Singh to Knox Vault on approximately six or 
seven occasions during this period. 
 
And then Mr Leonard with reference to the evidence 
that you had given before says at paragraph 23 in 
conclusion the legal issue that attracted media attention 
which I assume Mr Singh was referring to in his evidence 
arose from the execution of a summons issued by the 
commission in terms of which it took custody of safe 
10 
deposit boxes rented by Kuban Moodley at Knox Vault.   
 
The execution of the summons occurred on 25 June 
2019 more than two months after Witness 3 informed us 
about Knox Vault on 29 April 2019. 
 
You see that? 
MR SINGH:  I do Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Have you got any reason to question 
the truth and accuracy of this affidavit of Mr Leonard? 
MR SINGH:  Not at this stage. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  So what then would you say 
20 
to the proposition that the only way that Witness 3 could 
have known about your safe deposit boxes at Knox Vault is 
if he took you there as he alleges? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I am not sure how Mr – Witness 3 
came to know about the boxes that as we – as I have 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 9 of 296 
 
testified before Mr Chair Witness 3 has never taken me to 
Knox Vault on any occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Shall I take that as meaning that 
you are saying you accept that he got to know about it but 
you do not know how he knew about it because as far as 
you are concerned he never took you there? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair that is correct because as you see in 
the affidavit itself Mr Chair I was not the only person that 
formed the part of – that formed the content of the 
subpoena. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  There were other people that actually were 
also – information was requested from Knox Vaults so it 
would seem that maybe through that process people had 
got to know about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  So I would accept your proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Singh I am not sure that I 
follow your answer.  I mean last time you said that and you 
20 
must correct me if I am wrong.  Last time I understood you 
to say that Witness 3 came to learn about this because it 
was planted information by a member of the commission.  
Now you accept that that is not true so how is it then that 
Witness 3 knows of your facility at Knox Vault unless he 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 10 of 296 
 
took you there? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair if we have regard to the information 
that is presented to us today all of this information was 
available to the commission on the day that my evidence 
was led yet none of this information was available to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How does – how does that affect your 
answer? 
MR SINGH:  Oh well Mr Chairperson that is what I am –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that is… 
MR SINGH:  That is what I am trying to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is – because you – you either 
know what the position is or how Witness 3 would have 
come to know about the information relating to you and 
Knox Vault or you do not know you know. Whether you 
were shown information or not is not going to affect what 
you knew. 
MR SINGH:  No but that is my – that is what I am trying to 
get to Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  Is that on the day that I testified I did not 
20 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you not know? 
MR SINGH:  I did not know that the information relating to 
the investigators report came to the attention of the 
investigator on the 29 t h of April 2019. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 11 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  For example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  Because I was not presented with anything 
relating to Knox Vaults. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR SINGH:  So when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that – is that why you gave the answer 
you gave because you did not know that? 
MR SINGH:  Because I was asked how did he come to 
10 
know so I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you were denying. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So I then preferred or provided an 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  That I thought was relevant at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you accept now do you not that that 
explanation you provided namely of accusing somebody in 
the commission to have planted the information or given 
him that information to implicate you do you now accept 
20 
that that is not true? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So is – is – as I understand 
it the position you are in is you have denied that Witness 3 
took you to Knox Vault.  The evidence that you also accept 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 12 of 296 
 
suggest that he – he must have taken you there but – or at 
least he knows information that you would have known if 
he had taken you there.  But your position is he did not 
take you there and you cannot say how he came to know 
the information. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Now Mr 
Singh previously when you testified I asked you this is at 
10 
page 64 of the transcript of 12 March day 360.  I said what 
were you keeping in these four boxes?  And your answer 
was Mr Chair the four boxes is easy to explain.  There was 
a box for each one of the family – sorry each one of the 
members of the family.  You recall giving that evidence? 
MR SINGH:  Along those lines yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon. 
MR SINGH:  Along those lines yes Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  I am reading from the 
transcript.  So as I understand it the four members of the 
20 
family were you, your wife and your two children. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now in 2014 your children were aged 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 13 of 296 
 
on my calculations your eldest child was 12 and your 
youngest child was 4. 
MR SINGH:  In 2014? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  That could be probably be right yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Approximately. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what is it that you stored in the 
two boxes for your children? 
MR SINGH:  I do not recall right now but it could have 
10 
been documents for them – gifts for them, jewellery for 
them.  Odds and sods I do not really recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Documents for them like? 
MR SINGH:  Birth certificates and so on.  ID documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please speak up Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry birth certificates, ID documents and the 
like.  But Mr Chair these are personal – these are issues 
that relate to my personal being at the time.  I do not see 
the relevance for that in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you were – you kept in the 
20 
boxes is obviously relevant Mr Singh you know that.  You 
surely know that what you kept in the boxes is relevant 
because there are allegations of you taking money from the 
Gupta’s and taking it to Knox Vaults so you say you did not 
take any money – any cash from the Gupta’s and kept it at 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 14 of 296 
 
Knox Vault you – you indicated what you kept in those 
boxes but if the other version is true you may have kept 
money that you got from the Gupta’s in the boxes.  Is it 
not? 
MR SINGH:    Yes that is true Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so it is highly relevant.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  And you then went on to 
explain that as I understood your – you would keep some 
jewellery for your wife and you also said that you might 
keep or you did keep cash for yourself to a maximum value 
10 
as I recall evidence of R100 000.00. 
MR SINGH:  I think the number was between 100 to 
200 000.00. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Between 100 and? 
MR SINGH:  200. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Between 100 and 200 and that money 
you say you got if my memory serves me correctly from 
moonlighting and gambling. 
MR SINGH:  Well moonlighting was your suggestion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is the term that is commonly 
20 
used when an executive in a position such as you does 
private work on the side. 
MR SINGH:  Okay if that is the way it is – ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But that is how you got the money 
gambling and moonlighting. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 15 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  Well what we do know from 
records is that you did not have four boxes you had eight 
boxes you would have seen that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So let us go to page 1758. So let 
us… 
MR SINGH:  Sorry the 00:17:43. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1758 and before I get into the 
records so how does one square this with your previous 
10 
evidence.  Would you now say that you had two vaults or 
boxes for each family member? 
 MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair I think the – I also did mention in 
the previous testimony that I also used the boxes to store 
documents and stuff that was of relevance to me at the 
time. So the balance of the doc – the boxes were really to 
store documents that were relevant to me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Myburgh’s question is since 
when you gave your evidence you said you had – you kept 
20 
four boxes because you – the family consisted of four 
members. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How do you now explain the fact that 
there were not four boxes there were eight boxes?  Mr 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 16 of 296 
 
Myburgh did I get your question right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  So what is the explanation for having so 
many boxes much more than double the number of the 
family members? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair as I would recall again from the 
testimony that I had given at the time.  I did say I do not 
recall the number of boxes that I actually had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry just say that again. 
MR SINGH:  I said I do not recall the exact number boxes 
10 
that I had at the time.  Because remember at that – when I 
had given evidence the issue of Knox Vault was not put to 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not what? 
MR SINGH:  Was not put to us.  Was not put to me sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ah there was a discussion of Knox Vault 
what do you mean it was not put to you? 
MR SINGH:  No there was – there was discussions relating 
to Knox Vault that emanated from my testimony at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Based on Witness 3’s testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  But the details relating to Knox Vaults in 
terms of the information that you see before you today did 
not exist on the day that I testified. So when I testified I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 17 of 296 
 
was testifying from memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were testifying from? 
MR SINGH:  From memory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So hence when you asked how many boxes do 
you have I said I think I had approximately four boxes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  My Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Alright well you said 
you had approximately four but it turns out you had twice 
the number.   
10 
MR SINGH:  Point taken – point taken. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright then let us go to page 1758.  
What you will see it is quite useful and handwritten 
annotations at the top.  You count there – there are eight 
boxes.  Those were the numbers of the boxes correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So let us have a look at how this 
unfolded.  If you go to page 1759 you will see that this is 
the first box that you acquired and it was a transaction that 
was affected on the 12 t h of February 2013 and you will see 
20 
there at page 1759 in the middle of the page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh where do you see 
the date? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  The date DCJ is 1760 at the bottom 
under Mr Singh’s signature. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 18 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is 12 February 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It is a little obscure but it will become 
clear from the next document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, no I can see it now. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So we will become familiar with these 
– these documents as we go along because there is a 
series of them that are the same.  But at 1759 at 
paragraph 8 you will agree that it reflects then that you 
10 
acquired a small safe box on that day?  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what we see is you made an 
annual cash payment, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you will then find the invoice at 
page 1761 there you will see the invoice is dated 12 
February 2013.  You may a refundable key deposit and 
then you rented this small safety deposit box rental and 
you paid R2700.00.  Was that for the year? 
20 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you paid that in cash? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we then go to the second 
transaction.  Now that you find at page 1763 this is now on 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 19 of 296 
 
the 8 t h of May 2014 you acquired a large box, correct?  
That is reflected at 1763. 
MR SINGH:  1763. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Number 1424 and you will see at 
1764 on the same day you acquired box number 1425 
another large box and in fairness to you I have looked at 
these documents quite carefully.  What happened is that 
you upgraded the small box to a large box and then you 
rented another large.  Do you recall that? 
MR SINGH:  I do not recall that but if that is what you 
10 
saying Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well let me explain to you if you go 
to page 1765 which is the invoice relevant to you acquiring 
these boxes you see that it says the second line – large 
safety deposit box rental and then upgrade S to L 
presumably small to large.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  I do Sir.  I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that is May 2014.  Then in the 
next month June 2014 and this is at page 1766 you then 
rented another large box, you confirm that on the 9 t h of 
20 
June 2014.   
MR SINGH:  I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And the invoice you find over the 
page at 1767 you paid R4900.19 again in cash, correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 20 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then the next transaction was two 
months later in August 2014 you find this at page 1768 this 
time you rented another large box and now you had four, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you again paid annually in cash, 
is that right? 
MR SINGH:  From 1768 that is (inaudible). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Page 1768 it reflects annual cash. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you pay in cash? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if you go over the page 
1769 you see the invoice again you paid an amount of 
R4900.19 is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now the fifth transaction occurred 
two months later in August 2014 could I ask you please 
documents are out of sequence could I ask you to turn this 
time to page 1774.  So we have dealt with the transaction 
20 
on the 1 s t of August 2014 at 1774 there was a second 
transaction in August 2014 this time on the 15 t h of August, 
you see that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And now you acquired another large 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 21 of 296 
 
box two weeks or so later.  Is that right? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Again you paid annually in cash. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you find the invoice at page 1775 
and sorry – I am incorrect in fact on this day you acquired 
two boxes.  You go back to 1774 you will see there large 
number required 2, you see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And that is why the invoice again 
10 
settled in cash is much larger this time for R9160.08.  You 
see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you now had six large boxes. 
Correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we could now go to the sixth 
transaction and that you find at page 1770  
MR SINGH:  1770. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This occurred two months later in 
20 
October 2014.  And here you will see that this time you 
upgraded to an extra large box.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  So 1770. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1770. 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 22 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You acquired this time an extra large 
box to go with your six large boxes.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Again you paid in cash. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And it cost you R6008.00 correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So now you had six large boxes and 
one extra large box and then the next transaction you find 
at 1772 and this occurred in the next year 9 t h of February 
10 
2015 and this time you acquired for yourself an extra extra 
large box.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And again you paid in cash. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now this time you were given a 20% 
discount, correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why were you being given discount? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Sir 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Do you know why you were being 
given discounts? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir.  I guess – I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Not perhaps because you were a very 
good customer? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 23 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  It could be. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Then you see at page 1773 
that for that extra extra large box you paid in cash 
R6740.01.  So that is February 2015.  Then if I can ask you 
please to go to page 1776 we see that what happened 
here. 
MR SINGH:  1776. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1776.  Is that in August 2017, you 
then effectively cancel your facility.  Correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you returned the keys and you 
undertake that you no longer require the boxes. 
MR SINGH:   That is so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then what happens, and perhaps 
not particularly relevant, is the documents that followed at 
1770 and 1778, et cetera, they were then credit notes 
where you returned the keys, you were credited and 
presumable you were credited because there were pro-rata 
credit effects.  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Singh, I just want to hand up 
– I am going to ask you to go to the access records or 
customer record, visit record.  At page 1757.  Are you 
there? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 24 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   With your leave Chairperson, could I 
just hand up a copy of that page with certain handwritten 
annotations that I have made which will facilitate my 
examination with Mr Singh?  I do apologise for the 
handwriting but it will ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It should help everyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Is this part of the bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is annotations made on page 1757.  
10 
I will give you a copy. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I have done here, Mr Singh, is.  
From the left-hand side you will see that I have boxed in 
your name.  That boxing reflects the time that you were 
employed at Transnet.  On the right-hand side, there is 
another 
boxing 
running 
from 
14 
July 
2018 
up 
until 
20 March 2015.  That is the time that Witness 3 said that 
he 
worked 
for 
you. 
 
That 
is 
that 
boxing.  
Then...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the date with the right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   On the right-hand side, from 
18 July 2014 through to 20 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you call boxing on mine 
...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 25 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When I mean boxing, I have just 
drawn a line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes.  No, no, no.  Now I see.  
20 March? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  Now... I thought it was 
the one above that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So that is 20 March 2015 up to 
18 July 2014.  Is that right? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Witness 3 says that he worked as 
Mr Singh’s driver but the dates that fall within that range 
are from 18 July 2014 until 9 February 2015, DCJ, in the 
middle column.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am looking at the middle column.  
Is the first date column where you have boxed, is the first 
date 20 March 2015? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the last date within the box, 
18 July 2014? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Yes, it is.  I am sorry.  I was 
just reading it the other way around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have started with it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 26 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...but yes – hopefully, we – I think 
we are on the same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is alright.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So then Mr Singh, what I have done 
at the bottom of the middle column, is I have got small.  
You required that box on the 12 t h of February 2013.  I have 
put an asterisk because we know that it was then 
converted.  Now I want to follow the highlighting.  So on 
the 1 s t pink highlight, on the 8 t h of May 2014, you now 
acquired two large boxes.   
10 
 
You upgrade the small, you get a large.  That is 
in May of 2014.  You then visit that facility twice again in 
May and then in June you acquire another large box.  You 
visited the facility again in June and July.  Two months 
later in August, you acquire another large box.  Correct?  
On the 1 s t of August 2014.  Do you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, on the 1 s t of...  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then we know, two weeks later 
on the 15 t h of August 2014 you acquired two more large 
boxes.   Correct? 
20 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  This is – as in these dates 
with these documents? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 27 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then two months later – so you 
visited the facility, you get - in the month of August, you 
have actually acquired three large boxes.  You visited the 
facility in September and then in October, you get your 
extra-large box.  Correct? 
MR SINGH:   Oh, that – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 11 October? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you visit the facility in 
November twice and December and then early in the next 
year, you now get an extra extra-large box.  Do you see 
that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I want to just ask you 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hold on, Mr Myburgh.  I have been 
wondering why we – I seem to lose you.  The numbers 
have not been written in the normal sequence.  The earlier 
20 
months and the year are at the top. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, it is the other way around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So the year comes first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, that is fine but one expects 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 28 of 296 
 
that when you get a document like this and it gives you 
dates, you expect that the earlier date would be at the top. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you go down.  This is the other 
way around. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is the other way, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in other words, the document 
builds up. It reflects at the bottom the first time when 
Mr Singh went there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And at the top the last time he went 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh, I just want to – 
presumable on these days when you acquired these boxes, 
you had with you the things that you wanted to store in 
them? 
MR SINGH:   That would be a reasonable assumption but I 
do not recall. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So can you remember what caused 
you in May of 2014 to get two large boxes? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, maybe – I do not recall the exact 
reasons as to why these events occurred or why these 
boxes increased each and every single, let us call it, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 29 of 296 
 
highlighted item.  But Mr Chair, again, as I indicated 
previously.  These – the contents of these boxes related to 
personal items, documents and effects.   
 
During this period of time, Mr Chair again, as it 
relates to my personal affairs, I - my ex-wife were going 
through a separation process.  So to the extent that I 
needed to move stuff from my residence at the time, this 
was then placed in these boxes.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in August of 2014 when you take 
another two boxes, can you remember why you did that? 
10 
MR SINGH:   Look, Mr Chair, as I said.  In terms of the 
exact nature of why these occurred.  I do not recall why 
that happened in August 2014 or October 2014 but I 
understand and know that during this period of time my 
visits there and the increase in the number of boxes and 
the size of the boxes related to me putting in my personal 
effects and documents and other information that related to 
me moving out of my primary residence at the time.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then, why the need to get an 
extra-large box and then a need to get an extra extra-large 
20 
box? 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, again.  I will come back to the 
point of saying that it would be as it relates to the moving 
out process.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this evidence you did not give 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 30 of 296 
 
previously that relates to the moving out process. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, previously you said there 
are four boxes and they are easy to explain.  It is one for 
each of the family members. 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, as I have said to you 
previously.  These matters are private and confidential 
matters Mr Chair but - yes, I did not explain it before.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, but Mr Singh.  If the need to acquire 
boxes had something to do with you having to take some 
10 
personal items that had been kept in your house which you 
had decided to put in at Knox Vault, you would not have 
made it to explain anything.  You would simply have said:  
You know, I made a decision to put things, some items at 
Knox Vault that I have kept in the house. 
MR SINGH:   Look, Mr Chair, that was the – that was the 
line of my responses when I was here the previous 
occasion.  Now I am presented with substantially more 
information relating to the nature, the extent and the timing 
of the – for my transactions with Knox.  So I am offering 
20 
you an explanation relating to the information that is 
presented to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Could I ask you, 
please, to go to page 1759? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 31 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   1759... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What you will see and I think you go 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is one, seven...? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1759. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR SINGH:   Just give me on second Chair to page back. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I come back to that highlighted 
document...  Now you gave evidence the last time and it is 
borne out by this page that the – the width and the depth 
10 
of all of your boxes were the same.  So you will see, if you 
look at small all the way through to extra-large, the width 
and the depth is the same.  241 mm in width and the depth 
445 mm.  So the width of about 24 and depth of 45.5.  
Correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The only difference was in the 
height.  So the small box was very short and so it goes 
from 88 to 110 to 133, 260 for an extra-large and then an 
extra extra-large 520.  Do you see that? 
20 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if you could just have a look at 
one of these file boxes here, Mr Singh and I have put up - 
a file box in width is 29 cm.  These... were 5 cm narrow 
than that.  A fire box is also 45 cm in depth.  Al you have 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 32 of 296 
 
to work out is what really would the accumulative height 
been of the boxes that you rented.   
 
Well, we know that you had five large ones and 
that which was 30 cm and that you had one extra-large and 
another extra extra-large.  When I have added that up, the 
total height would have been about 160 cm which would be 
the equivalent of five file boxes.  So if you look from here, 
this is three.   
 
You will put another two on top of that, it would 
really be the area, roughly, that you rented.  Do you see 
10 
that? 
MR SINGH:   There is four... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am looking from here. 
MR SINGH:   Oh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One, two, three.  We can – I cannot 
put two there because it is too high.  I cannot reach it.  Ja, 
so it would be five.  You get a sense then of how much 
space it was.  Just to give you an example.  Although these 
are a little broader, you can, as you know, store five lever 
arch files in each one of these boxes.  So in five, you can 
20 
store 25 lever arch files and you can store 500-pages in a 
lever ach file, as you would know.  12 500 half pages.  It is 
a lot of space.  You can get a lot of things in there, not so? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The last time ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 33 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, whether it is not necessary 
for the record just to indicate what the size of each file is 
in terms of height so that when you – when somebody 
reads the record and you say five files they have an idea 
how high they would go. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or if you have go the number ready, just 
read it into the record.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have done a rough calculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me – perhaps during the break 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...I will make sure that it is 
completely accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I will also give Mr Singh’s legal 
representative an opportunity to confirm it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, that is fine.  It is just that 
sometimes one forgets these things because one is 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...and somebody is reading the record 
without – has no idea how high the files were.  Okay 
alright. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 34 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Now Mr Singh, the last 
time we spoke about how much this was costing you.  What 
we have seen is that a large box cost about R 4 000,00 a 
year, an extra-large one about R 5 000,00 and an extra 
extra-large one, I think, in the order – in the region of 
R 10 000,00.  So on my calculations this was costing you a 
lot, about R 35 000,00 a year.  Does that recall roughly 
with your recollection in studying of these documents? 
MR SINGH:   I would take it as correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And all of that money you paid here 
10 
in cash.  Where did you get that cash from, incidentally? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I have testified.  The boxes also 
contained around R 200 000,00 in cash.  So that was the 
cash that I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat that sentence, please. 
MR SINGH:   I said, as I have testified before, the boxes 
did contain cash.  So I used some of that cash to pay for 
these boxes and I also, obviously, replenished that cash 
from time to time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, Mr Peter, when he took over 
from you as the Group Chief Financial Officer.  Do you 
know that he also, him and/or his mother acquired boxed at 
Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   I did not know that. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 35 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, he and/or his mother had 
seven large boxes, a similar number to you.  I assume you 
cannot 
comment 
or 
would 
you 
describe 
that 
to 
a 
coincidence? 
MR SINGH:   I cannot comment. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if I could take you back to this 
page 757 with my annotations.  If you have a look in the 
middle column, that box that I have done in the middle, 
running from 18 July 2014 up until 20 August 2015.  All of 
those days, except for one, was a weekday.  The day that 
10 
was on a weekend, as I have it, is the 11 t h of October 
2014.  Perhaps you could just mark that. 
MR SINGH:   Yes... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The rest of the days were all during 
the week.  So there are nine days then that fall within that 
range, weekdays.  What I wanted to put to you, Mr Singh, 
is.  What I do not follow is this.  Your own evidence and 
you have confirmed Witness 3’s statement when Witness 3 
says, how things would work on a normal working day is, I 
would go and I would go and collect Mr Singh at his home.  
20 
Where was that?  In the Midrand? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And I would take him to the 
Carlton Centre and I would drive him around the whole day 
and then I would take him back and you worked, it seems, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 36 of 296 
 
long hours.  So seeing that you went to Knox Vault during 
this period, nine time during the week, surely Witness 3 
must have taken you there.  Who else could have taken 
you there?   
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, also my own testimony and my 
testimony of Witness 3, he also testified that my personal 
vehicle was parked at the basement of the Transnet offices 
during the week and that is the vehicle that I would have 
used to visit Knox Vault during the period of these days 
that would appear to be during the week. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry.  Mr Singh, I thought you might 
say that but that is not what the evidence reflects.  The 
evidence reflects, because you remember this arise in the 
context of the Three Rivers and the maroon bag of cash.   
 
And the evidence that was given, you confirmed 
this, is that occasionally what you would do is you would 
drive your blue M3 BMW to the Carlton Centre on a 
Monday, it would stay there in the basement, it might be 
washed on a Friday and then you would drive it home.  Not 
all the time.  Occasionally.   
20 
 
No 
evidence 
has 
been 
given 
in 
these 
proceedings that you ever during the week drove yourself 
anywhere.  In fact, you confirmed Witness 3’s evidence. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I – this is – I am at a loss 
...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 37 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   ...in terms of responding to this because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you respond, I must just tell 
you that my recollection too is that you said that you would 
drive yourself during the weekends which I understood to 
confirm that generally speaking, I would not say there 
would be no exception, but generally speaking, during the 
week, when it is doing working hours you would be driven 
by your driver. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Now that is my point Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   Generally speaking, as you had said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   Nine times in a period of a year is generally 
speaking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   But I may have also driven myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  So you mean you ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Okay let me put it to you this way Mr Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   Had I known that I needed to – that I have 
driven myself occasionally during the week at the time, I 
would have said so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 38 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Because Mr Chair, when I was confronted 
with Witness 3’s statement it was done on the basis that 
generally that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your version that, generally, when 
you would allow your driver to drive you to different places 
but when it came to going to Knox Vault, you would make 
sure that he did not drive you there.  You would drive 
yourself there? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say – because this is an 
10 
eight month period – you say that in an eight month period 
you drove yourself there nine times during a normal 
business day? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  And you see the times? 
MR SINGH:   I do see. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Opposite 18 July 2014, two o’clock, 
then one o’clock, eleven o’clock.  Right in the middle of the 
business day.  Correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you not want your driver to 
know that you had reason to go to Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   Look, Mr Chair, I think I did testify previously 
that these were personal matters and from my perspective I 
did not really want him to be part of these matters. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 39 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if he was not going to see what 
was in the box, he would just drive you there.  That is all.  
And remain in the car.  There was nothing, you know, he 
was not going to go any personal matters, other than that 
you had some business to do at Knox Vault.  Why did you 
not want him to know that you had some business to do at 
Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, as I say it was a personal 
decision that I made at the time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say to the proposition that 
10 
you may have – you might not have wanted him to see that 
because you had something to hide about your visits to 
Knox Vault? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair.  I do not know if you ask me to 
speculate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I am saying if that 
proposition is put to you, you say – because remember his 
version is.  He would drive you to the Gupta residence.  
You would get cash there.  And then he would drive you to 
Knox Vault where you would take that cash.  Now, from 
20 
what he said, it does not appear that that would be 
legitimate cash.   
 
So I ask the question.  If that was not legitimate 
cash, maybe that might have been the reason why you 
would have, on your version, decided that whenever you 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 40 of 296 
 
went there you did not want him to know.  That is assuming 
your version is true.   
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair that is not the reason.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  What is the reason? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I said it was personal matters 
that I decided to deal with on my own. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   And that was the reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Mr Singh, can I ask 
10 
you, please, to pick out Exhibit BB-14(b)? 
MR SINGH:   [Speaker moves away from microphone – 
unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Have 
you 
got 
the 
page 
number 
Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, if I could ask you, please, to 
turn to page 127? 
MR SINGH:   [Speaker moves away from microphone – 
unclear] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Go to page 127. 
20 
MR SINGH:   127? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, the numbers are on the right-
hand side. 
MR SINGH:   The red numbers? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, there is only black numbers on 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 41 of 296 
 
this if we are in the same file.   
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry to interrupt.  
We just trying to establish, at this stage, my attorney and 
myself, if this bundle was in fact emailed to us and when it 
was so that so that we can follow the evidence or maybe 
my learned friend can assist us just with the date on which 
this bundle was mailed to us so that we can ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well... I do not know when it was 
mailed to my learned friend but of course she did have it 
because this is Witness 3’s affidavit that Mr Singh was 
10 
examined on extensively at the last sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think that should help her. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   That helps us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
So 
this 
file 
only 
has 
red 
numbers 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   For ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have my – can I ask you to 
go to page 127?  Yes.   
20 
MR SINGH:   Is that the red number? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Well, if that is a red number, 
fine. 
MR SINGH:   Ja, sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that a page from Witness 3’s 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 42 of 296 
 
affidavit with the heading in the middle, COP Services to 
Anoj Singh? 
MR SINGH:   That is so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Could I take you, please, to 
paragraph 31? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
“On a normal working day, I used to pick 
Mr Singh up at his home in the morning around 
06:30 in Wendywood and from there, driving to 
10 
the Carlton Centre. 
After work, I would drop him off at his home 
again...” 
 
You 
confirm 
that 
in 
your 
earlier 
testimony, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The next paragraph 32: 
“During the course of the day, I would drive 
him to meetings or to whichever destination he 
would instruct me...” 
20 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You can confirmed that the last time, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   If you say so.  I do not recall. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 43 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if you go over the page to 128 at 
36, paragraph 36: 
“In instances, Singh would drive to the office with 
his private vehicle, a blue BMW M3 on Friday 
afternoons he would travel home with his vehicle, 
the vehicle would be parked in the basement of the 
Carlton Centre during the week.” 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in fact you confirm that on 
10 
another occasion in dealing with the Three Rivers Lodge.  
Do you recall that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it certainly does not appear from 
this and from your confirmation of these paragraphs that 
you drove yourself during …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, before my learned 
friend continues, with the greatest of respect to him, what 
he is trying to put does not exclude what the witness gave 
evidence.  So what Mr Singh’s version is, that he 
20 
occasionally used his own vehicle to do certain things, is 
not excluded by what the witness said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let Mr Myburgh put the question, 
let Mr Singh answer and we take it from there. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 44 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So perhaps I could put it most easily 
this way.  Mr Singh, when you confirmed these paragraphs 
in your evidence you made no reference to the fact that 
you would occasionally driver yourself, correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   But that was on the basis, Mr Chair, that we 
were talking about generally. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, I am still …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Singh, if the position was that 
10 
sometimes you did drive yourself during the week surely 
you would have said so because otherwise the statement 
that during the week he would drive you around and your 
car will be parked the whole week in the basement and you 
would take it on Friday home and come back with it on 
Monday would not be correct.  You understand? 
MR SINGH:   I take your point, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright and then there is just two last 
questions that I want to ask with reference to my hand 
20 
annotations. 
MR SINGH:   Before we move off the dates, can we ask 
exactly what dates were these? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What days of the week? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 45 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We can do that.  What I asked one 
of my team members to do yesterday was to determine if 
any of these days fell within the weekend and what I was 
advised is that the only weekend day was the 11 October 
2014. 
MR SINGH:   It will be interesting to see the rest of the 
days. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR SINGH:   I said it will be interesting to see the rest of 
the days would look like. 
10 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I think the witness, Mr Singh 
and Mr Myburgh is speaking at cross purposes about what 
Mr Singh is referring to as what days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, were you, Mr Singh, wanting to 
know which of these days would be Monday or Tuesday or 
Wednesday? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not just whether it is a weekday or a 
weekend, not just that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so – or you wanted to know that 
plus whether it was a Tuesday or Monday or Wednesday or 
Thursday as well? 
MR SINGH:   I think, Mr Chair, just the days of the week 
would be sufficient. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 46 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what day each one is? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Well, maybe one should ask 
why would that matter because we know that Mr Myburgh 
asked you the questions because the evidence was that 
during the week your car would be parked at the basement 
and the driver would drive you to meetings and drive you 
around.  Why would that – why would knowing which day of 
the week each date be important or relevant? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, to – so my version is, no 
10 
matter which day of the week it was, I drove to the vault. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   On witness 3’s version and based on the 
evidence that I led before, you are saying that I did not – it 
have would not been probable that on a weekday I would 
have driven myself.  So a weekday also is a Monday and is 
also a Friday which meant I had access to my car on a 
Monday and a Friday based on the version that we had just 
discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so …[intervenes] 
20 
MR SINGH:   So if it is on a Monday and  Friday then it 
concurs with let us call it the evidence of witness 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be about the car …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   The car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Being used on …[intervenes] 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 47 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   On a Monday or a Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well - no, I understand what you 
say but except that my recollection is that the dates that 
appear at page 1757, the information that appears there 
shows that it was during the date as opposed to after hours 
or to early in the morning, so it would have been during the 
time when on witness 3’s version the car was parked.  So I 
understand you to be suggesting that look, witness 3 says 
on Fridays I will take the home. 
MR SINGH:   But, Mr Chair, equally, there could be many 
10 
reasons as to why.  I could either be leaving the office 
early, I had gone out for – okay, I cannot say I went out for 
lunch because on his version I never went out for lunch 
without him.  I always went out with him.  So equally so, Mr 
Chair, I could have been leaving the office early, let us say 
at 14.26, for example, if it was a Friday, I could have been 
leaving the office early.  Or if it was on a Monday, for 
example, and it was …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you were leaving 10.30. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, if it was 10.55 on a Monday I could 
20 
equally be coming late to the office or I could have had 
meetings and then was coming to the office.  So those are 
plausible explanations as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just so that I understand – as I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 48 of 296 
 
understand your evidence, on a Monday you could go to 
work – I mean, you seem to work long hours. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact witness 3 says that he 
fetched you at what was it, half past six in the morning. 
MR SINGH:   Around that time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he would take you back home 
and often that would be at ten o’clock or even later. 
MR SINGH:   Not – well… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Or sometimes, I beg your pardon.  
10 
When would you usually get home on a normal working 
day? 
MR SINGH:   On a normal working day probably around 
seven. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Seven, so basically you were on 
duty from seven to seven. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And as I understood your evidence, 
on a Monday you would not get a late start, you would 
drive your own car occasionally to work.  Presumably you 
20 
left about the same time. 
MR SINGH:   I could not hear you, Sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I said I could not hear you there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As I understood the evidence, if you 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 49 of 296 
 
decided 
to 
take 
your 
BMW 
to 
work 
on 
a 
Monday, 
presumably you would leave at the same time.  There 
would no reason to go to work late. 
MR SINGH:   Unless there was a meeting or… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Unless I had a personal commitment, or… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sure.  And then, of course, the same 
thing applies when you drive back.  Just because you are 
driving your own car would not mean that you would leave 
early, you would see out the business day in the ordinary 
10 
course, correct? 
MR SINGH:   That will be correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now your earlier testimony 
also gave rise to the need to get another – a further 
affidavit from witness 3.  Could I ask you please to go to 
page 1919? 
MR SINGH:   Of which bundle, Sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is bundle 5C. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, we again want to 
place on record – I understand what my learned friend says 
20 
that these documents – but we are working off bundles that 
is disclosed to us.  We come here and we would like to 
follow the evidence based on bundles that were disclosed.  
That is why my attorney through the course of the week 
and even last week said please forward us the reference 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 50 of 296 
 
bundles.  It is not good enough to say oh, but we sent you 
an email with the witness’ statement, we would like to 
follow the evidence so that we know what is happening 
with reference to a reference bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not know what Mr Myburgh 
has to say but I do know that evidence leaders when they, 
as the witnesses comes here, they bring a lot of files 
belonging to that work stream even when they might not 
necessarily need some but just to have them at hand.  Mr 
Myburgh, do you want to say anything? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I do know that my learned 
friend has received and electronic company of EXHIBIT 23.  
It may be when I refer to 5B or 5C, it is not easy for her to 
make that delineation.  But I am referring to page 1919 of 
EXHIBIT 23.  Mr Singh, are you there? 
MR SINGH:   I am, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 1919? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and that, DCJ, is in your bundle 
5C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if you go to paragraph 5 and 
page 1920, witness 3 says: 
“In summary Mr Singh probed the testimony relating 
to me having identified Mr Matshela Koko and Ms 
Linda Mabaso at the Gupta residence in Saxonwold 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 51 of 296 
 
during the period July 2013 to December 2013 
whilst I was seconded to the former Minister Mr 
Malusi Gigaba during his tenure at the Department 
of Public Enterprises.  Mr Singh states that I 
recognise Mr Koko and Ms Mabaso in 2013 whilst 
they were not public figures and contends that to be 
anomaly in my evidence.” 
Witness 3 goes on: 
“I wish to clarify the I misunderstanding that is 
seemingly being created by Mr Singh in this regard.  
10 
During my tenure as close protection officer to Mr 
Gigaba during the period July 2013 to December 
2013 I did not who Mr Koko and Ms Mabaso were at 
the time.  Further, my evidence has not been that I 
knew who these individuals were in 2013.  I only 
became aware of who they are at a later stage and 
that point in time when I saw these individuals I 
recalled that I had seen them on previous occasions 
and that this during my tenure on the secondment at 
DPE whilst we were at the Gupta residence with Mr 
20 
Gigaba.” 
Paragraph 8: 
“At the time when my secondment at the DPE came 
to an end I returned to Transnet where I was 
redeployed as a security manager of Transnet 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 52 of 296 
 
offices in Carlton Centre in January 2014.  July 
2014 I was assigned to the office of the Group Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
to 
perform 
driver 
and 
close 
protection officer duties until the end of February 
2019.  During my tenure as close protection officer 
in the office of the GCFO which is located in the 
executive for Transnet I came to know of number of 
individuals either within Transnet or who would 
frequent Transnet’s offices.  Further, during the 
course and scope of my duties as a close protection 
10 
officer I was exposed to a number of individuals 
who may be regarded as high profile individuals.” 
Paragraph 9: 
“Regarding Mr Koko, I confirm that I did not know 
who he is when I saw him at the Gupta residence in 
2013.  I only began to know who Mr Koko is when 
Mr Singh was seconded to Eskom during on or 
about July or August 2015.  I provided close 
protection and driver services to Mr Singh during 
his 
secondment 
at 
Eskom 
for 
a 
period 
of 
20 
approximately two months.  It was during this period 
when I saw Mr Koko at Eskom and I recalled that I 
had seen him on a previous occasion in 2013 at the 
Gupta 
residence 
in 
Saxonwold 
during 
my 
secondment.” 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 53 of 296 
 
10: 
“Regarding Ms Mabaso I confirm that I did not know 
who she is when I saw her at the Gupta residence 
in 2013.  When she was appointed as Chairperson 
of Transnet 2014 I recognised her as someone I had 
seen before.  I recalled that I had seen on a 
previous occasion in 2013 at the Gupta residence in 
Saxonwold during my secondment at the DPE.” 
Paragraph 11: 
“I hope the above clarifies this aspect of my 
10 
evidence before this honourable Commission which 
evidence I maintain is to the best of my knowledge 
true and correct.” 
Do you have any comment on that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair.  Mr Chair, this was requested 
in terms of clarification based on, as Mr Myburgh has said, 
relating to an anomaly that I had raised in witness 3’s 
evidence and I would want to say that, Mr Chair, the 
response seeks to amplify rather than clarify it in my view 
in that witness 3 now confirms that he had not known 
20 
either of those individuals in 2013 or who they were in 
2013, yet recognising a year and maybe two years later 
having seen them once, he immediately recognises them as 
the same individuals that he had seen once at the Gupta 
residence and I submit, Mr Chair, that that is highly 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 54 of 296 
 
improbable and I mean, in my case, I do not probably 
remember people that I saw a week ago and yet witness 3 
has the ability to remember people that he has not even 
spoken to on one occasion but just seen on one occasion 
but recall them a year to two years later. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, anything else? 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems a fair point to make, Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    I want to turn to another topic and 
10 
that is your bi travel, personal, private travel.  Now I 
certainly do not intend to re-traverse in any detail the 
ground that was traversed with you before my colleague Mr 
Seleka in the Eskom stream but I just wanted to ask you 
one or two questions and that is about that before I get 
onto what I want to deal with.  Travel Excellence, you 
dispute that it was the travel agent used by Mr Essa and 
Sahara Computers. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I am going to 
object.  My learned friend, if he says that Mr Singh 
20 
disputes that he needs to refer to the evidence where he 
disputed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he is asking it whether he disputes 
it. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Oh. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 55 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I cannot, it is not within my 
knowledge to know whether Mr Essa or Sahara used them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how is it that you came to use 
this particular travel agent?  I mean, what we know is it is 
a small – a one woman show, really, that was joined – Ms 
Suleiman joined them.  Now is it that you picked this travel 
agency?  It is just… 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, as I think I testified before, before 
the Commission, I do not exactly recall how I ended up 
10 
with them so that was my testimony at the time, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So insofar as it is found that Ms 
Suleiman’s evidence is accepted, that she was Mr Essa’s 
travel agent, she was Sahara Computer ’s travel agent, 
your evidence is just coincidental that you happened to 
land up at the same travel agent. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you cannot tell us how that 
came about? 
MR SINGH:  No, Sir.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now do you dispute Ms Suleiman’s 
evidence that your flights were allocated to Mr Essa’s 
account? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do dispute that?  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 56 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you have yourself any credit 
facility at Travel Excellence?  
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, based on the testimony that 
we provided previously, I was of the view that I was 
booking tickets on my own, which I then paid for on my 
own.  I had no recollection or association with the fact that 
the accounting and administration of Travel Excellence was 
in fact allocating my tickets to Mr Essa’s account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe I will ask this question in 
10 
response to Mr Myburgh’s question whether you disputed 
that Travel Excellence would allocate your bookings to Mr 
Essa’s account, you said yes, you would dispute that.  I am 
not sure whether you truly want to dispute that simply 
because what he is talking about, Mr Myburgh, is the 
evidence from the two people from – oh well, the one 
person from Travel Excellence who was saying internally at 
Travel Excellence this is what we used to do.  So now you 
did not work for Travel Excellence, how would you know 
that that is not how they did it? 
20 
MR SINGH:   From that perspective, I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot dispute that, all you might be 
able to say is as far as you are concerned they had no 
reason to do that. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 57 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that they factually did that you 
cannot dispute. 
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you, because her 
evidence was that she considered Mr Essa to be the 
guarantor of your ticket but I think in line with what the 
DCJ has asked you, you would say well, I cannot dispute 
that. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, sorry, I do not 
10 
want to interrupt Mr Myburgh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:    But he just indicated that her 
evidence was – and I do not recall that she gave evidence 
or is a referring to the contents of her statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he is referring to the contents of 
the affidavit because obviously the contents of an affidavit 
is evidence, it is just evidence on affidavit.  I think that is 
what he means, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Because on the last occasion we 
were made aware that the witness might be called. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I just want to make sure that the 
witness has not been called in the interim and we were not 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 58 of 296 
 
given notice of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, she has not been called in the 
meantime, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, well, Mr Singh, you have the 
question. 
MR SINGH:   I am sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Her evidence or her affidavit – her 
affidavit reflects that she considered Mr Essa to be the 
guarantor of your tickets. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, Sir. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You cannot dispute that but you say 
certainly I was – as far as I am concerned, I was 
transacting with them completely independently.  
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I would like to just hand up a 
schedule, if I may, this one is slightly better arranged than 
the previous one, Chairperson, which I would like to use as 
a roadmap for my examination of Mr Singh.  There is a lot 
of cross-referring and documents are in different places, 
this would make things easier.  I do not suggest that it has 
20 
any evidentiary weight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is simply a means to examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just for convenience.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to – perhaps I can just 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 59 of 296 
 
explain this document, Mr Singh, and if you have any 
questions, please ask me.  I have listed six trips which I 
want to question you on and if we take the first trip, 30 
April to 2 May 2014 (BB23, page 26 para 113.3) that is the 
reference to the 10.6.  You will remember in the 10.6 you 
were asked to answer about various trips. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Myburgh, I was looking at 
the document you have just handed up. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the file should we go to a particular 
10 
page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I have not gone to any page yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not yet.  Oh, okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, maybe it would be 
convenient if the witness is referred to his actual affidavit 
that collates with the 10.6 because it would be easier for 
all of us to follow. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I will get there, I am explaining what 
20 
it deals with.  So 30 April to 2 May, BB23, page 426, 
paragraph 113.3, that was the reference in the 10.6 and 
then page 480, paras 52 to 53, that is your answer. 
 
In the column present or flew with, that is the 
allegation made in the 10.6 that present in Dubai at this 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 60 of 296 
 
time were Gupta and Essa.  Where Ms Suleiman’s affidavit 
deals with the trip, I have paraphrased what she says and 
then in next column, AS, those are your initials, I have 
paraphrased what your response was and then really it 
take me to what I am going to ask you about and that is 
documents in BB23.  So I am really trying to tie the 
documents to each of the trips. 
 
So I am going to deal with the 30 April to 2 May 
2014 trip, then the 3 June to 8 May trip, 7 to 12 August 
trip, 6 to 9 November trip, 25 February to 1 March trip and 
10 
11 to 15 June trip. 
 
Now what I want to just ask you, as I understood 
your evidence that you gave when you were examined – 
when Mr Seleka was leading you, as I understand it, you 
say that all of these trips but for number two were private 
and personal trips, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Seleka did not press you on 
that but I want to ask you – I mean, what do you mean that 
they were private and personal trips?  What is it that you 
20 
were doing there?  And now we are talking about trips one 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think just to be accurate, I think he did 
ask him the same question at some stage or another, say 
please clarify private and personal. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 61 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you can [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, DCJ you will …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, maybe just again 
for the record.  At the time Mr Seleka left it there, Mr Singh 
made it clear that it is private what his business was there.  
So that it is just clear for the record and it was 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja, maybe Mr Myburgh means that 
10 
the mere fact that Mr Singh says it is private should not 
end the question. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think – I think – ja, you may 
proceed, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I want to know – my 
question simply is, what were you doing there? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What were you doing there? 
MR SINGH:   I was on private business, Sir. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Private business?  What business? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, these were private trips that I was 
engaged on to either holidays or vacation in some cases. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   Holidays or vacations in some cases. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 62 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Private business and holidays are 
different things, Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:   Ja …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I need to – and I would like you to 
be – we need to be clear here.  What is it that you were 
doing?  You said that trips one, three, five – sorry, one, 
three, four, five and six were private and personal, they 
were not business trips.  Now what I want to know, what 
were you doing there? 
MR SINGH:   So let me clarify, Mr Chair.  When I say they 
10 
were not business trips, Mr Chair, they were not business 
trips as it relates to official travel for Transnet purposes.  
So 
they 
were 
private 
in 
that 
sense. 
 
Does 
that 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Fine, that I understand.  Now I want 
to know what were you doing there?  So, I mean, it is not a 
difficult question.  It is private, yes, I was on holiday.  It 
was private, I went and rode a mountain bike race or I 
played golf.  What is it that you were doing there? 
MR SINGH:   So then subsequent you asked what were you 
20 
doing and I then responded and said I was there on private 
– as I said, I was there was on private and private – it was 
my private travel and you asked what did I do and then I 
said at some stages I was there for vacation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 63 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   So... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Holiday? 
MR SINGH:   On holiday. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR SINGH:   Okay?  On some occasions I was there to – 
how can I say - to expand my personal network within the 
UIE. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Expand?   
MR SINGH:  My own ability to, so it was my own private 
business.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I do not understand.  
MR SINGH:  So Mr Chair, this ... these line of questioning 
was put to me in the parliamentary inquiry, and at that 
stage Mr Chair, I explained to the parliamentary inquiry 
that at that stage I was engaging with the UIE individual, 
and we had common business objectives at the time.  
 
He sought advice, and I sought advice and we 
mutually collaborated.  That was the reasons for these 
trips.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were undertaking these trips 
20 
because there was an individual in Dubai with whom you 
were exploring business opportunities? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So who is this individual? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I disclosed the name of the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 64 of 296 
 
individual at the parliamentary inquiry.  His name was Mr 
Albulashi.  . 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Albulashi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want to spell that for us? 
MR SINGH:  ALB, if I am correct.  ALBULASHI. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ALBU? 
MR SINGH:  L. 
CHAIRPERSON:  L. 
MR SINGH:  SHI. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  SHI.   
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the surname or the name? 
MR SINGH:  That is the surname. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, have you got the name? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I will have to check my record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And provide that to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Oh, the initials, you remember the 
initials maybe? 
20 
MR SINGH:  No sir, I think it was M. 
CHAIRPERSON:  M? 
MR SINGH:  M. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So who did Mr Albalushi work for? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 65 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, he is a private citizen.  He has his 
own business interests.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So when you were expanding your 
network as you put it in the UAE, did it extend beyond Mr 
Albalushi?  You had meetings with other people or how did 
you extend this network of yours? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, as it relates to these trips facing 
point, to the extent that it would require for Mr Albulushi 
and myself to meet other individuals, that would have been 
facilitated through him and we would then meet them, yes 
10 
Mr Chair.  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Alright. 
 
So 
you 
met 
other 
individuals? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You were looking for business 
opportunity? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, in my case it was a case of 
trying 
to 
understand 
what 
would 
I 
do 
once 
I 
have 
completed my stint as the CFO of Transnet and it was 
always my intention that I would look at immigrating from 
20 
the country in some way, shape or form, in terms of me 
able to take up some sort of opportunity within the global 
environment.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now did you ever have occasioned to 
open a bank account in the UAE? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 66 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you ever have occasioned to 
purchase any property in the UAE? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now what we do see is that in the 
space of little over 13 and a half months, 30 April 2014 to 
June 2015, you frequented Dubai often.  Correct?    
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now perhaps we are just dealing with 
this private and personal issue.  trip number 2, the 3 June 
10 
to 8 June. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I understood your evidence, so I am 
going to go into the detail in a moment, but I understood 
your evidence to say look, you seem to have, you were not 
in Dubai the whole time.  you were there, you flew to 
Frankfurt and Heathrow and then for a period of time you 
were in Dubai. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would that time that you were in 
20 
Dubai, would that also have been a private and personal 
trip? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Was that a business trip? 
MR SINGH:  This was a business trip.  This was an official 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 67 of 296 
 
business trip. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Number two is an official, throughout 
business trip.  Alright.  So let us have a look at the first 
private trip on 30 April.  Then three months later you go 
again on the 7 t h of August.  Three months later you go 
again, 6 t h of November.  
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, maybe it is opportune at this time 
while Mr Myburgh is talking about the trip of the 7 t h of 
August [indistinct].  Mr Chair, my previous testimony was 
that I confirmed this trip  based on the evidence that had 
10 
been provided by Ms Sulliman.  
 
On return home Mr Chair, the family had actually 
indicated to me that I would have probably not been, I 
actually, we actually did not do this trip, because there was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the April one? 
MR SINGH:  No sir, item 3 on the table.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, August? 
MR SINGH:  August 7 to 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR SINGH:  And the reason for that Mr Chair was that 
there was actually a bereavement in the family, and the 
bereavement occurred on the 1 s t of August.  There was a 
ceremony on the 4 t h of August I think and then there was a 
final cremation on the 6 t h of August.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 68 of 296 
 
 
So these dates Mr Chair, are problematic in terms 
of the fact that I did confirm them, however I did not, I 
actually did not fly.  So we actually did not attend this trip.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that you certainly did not 
travel, do that trip? 
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So we are at November.  
What we do know, is you then go three months later, four 
months later.  You go in February and then a few months 
10 
after that you go again in June.  So you went there quite 
often.   
 
Correct?   
MR SINGH:  What is that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You went to Dubai often. 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now let us take the first trip.  You 
accept that you went on it.  You said that you were 
unaware of the presence of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Rajesh Gupta and ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr R Gupta and Mr Essa.  Can I ask 
you please, and I really just want to take you through the 
documents listed in the right hand column.  Can I ask you 
to go to page 1949.  Exhibit 23.  Bundle 5C.  Now at 1949 
through to 1954, there is a series of documents that fall 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 69 of 296 
 
within this date range of your trip, 30 April to 2 May.   
 
Now could I ask you to go to 1949?  You see there 
is an email in face of it from Ashu.  Do you know who Ashu 
is?   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, if this is Mr Ashu as I have testified 
before, Mr Ashu Shwala, then I did testify that I had an 
occasion to meet him.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ashu Shwala you knew him as a, as 
working at Sahara? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And what position did you know he 
held there? 
MR SINGH:  I think he was the CEO or something of the 
company. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, the CEO, and did you know that 
he worked in Sahara’s offices in Johannesburg?   
MR SINGH:  Yes sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Singh, I can look up your 
evidence, but when I asked you previously about Sahara 
and who worked there, was it not your evidence that you 
20 
did not know?  That you assumed that the Gupta’s some of 
the Gupta brothers worked there.  
 
Did you always know that Mr Shwala worked at 
Sahara’s offices in Johannesburg? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do not recall when I got to meet Mr 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 70 of 296 
 
Shwala, but the reason why I responded to the question of 
whether I knew him or not, was Mr Seleka was going 
through this long list of individuals, and that is when I 
recognised the name, and the Mr Seleka then asked how 
did you know him and then I said well, I met him at the 
functions, at the Gupta residence.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Now when you went to 
Dubai, in what hotel would you stay? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, normally at the Oberoi Hotel. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay.  So you see that this is an 
10 
email from Mr Shwala to Tony Gupta, and he is forwarding 
something from that hotel, the Oberoi Hotel.  It says: 
 
“Charge slips PDF.  Mr Essa, Mr Gupta, Mr Singh.” 
 
Do you wee that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then over the page one sees a 
series of charge slips.  
MR SINGH:  I see that Mr Chair.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go to page 1951, you get an 
invoice.  It is addressed to Mr Essa.  The right hand says it 
20 
reflects an arrival on the 29 t h of April and a departure on 
the 1 s t of May, and you will see that that, on the face of 
this document, that invoice was settled using a Mastercard 
ended 9115. 
 
Do you see that?   
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 71 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then over the page at 1952, you 
have on the face of it an invoice this time in the name of 
Mr Rajesh Gupta, also arriving 29 leaving 1 May, and that 
invoice appears at sorry, 1953 to have been settled also 
using this Mastercard, 9115.  Do you see that?  at page 
1953. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we go to page 19 ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, before my 
10 
learned friend continue, I would like him to place on record 
these documents that he is currently referring to.  These 
are documents that were obtained by the investigators or is 
it in fact documents that were obtained through the Gupta 
leads, 
because 
that 
impacts 
on 
the 
veracity 
of the 
documents.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you.  Chairperson, what 
these documents were sourced from [indistinct], which as 
you know is the commission’s really database of all 
documentation.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  To my learned friend’s point, I am 
advised that these are part of the Gupta leaked documents.  
what you would know Chairperson is that there is a project 
within the commission to seek to authenticate the Gupta 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 72 of 296 
 
leaked documents, and that there are experts working on 
that.   
 
I understand that that is a project that is headed up 
by a lady named Anna Mart Nieman, and the intention is to 
establish the authenticity of these documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I am aware of that.  That is still 
to be done. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, just to confirm.  
None of these documents has as yet been verified.  There 
is no META data to verify the authenticity of it.  it is not 
10 
being verified by doing investigations in Dubai as an 
example.  
 
My learned friend is using it as it is, or as it was 
obtained through the Gupta leaks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  So Mr Singh, then at 
1954 there is reference to it appears another invoice, 
Rajesh Gupta and then you will see in the middle, 
accommodation charge and there is reference to you and 
on the face of it there is a charge to Mr Gupta. 
20 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So on the face of these documents, 
what you see is that not only were Mr R Gupta and Mr Essa 
in Dubai, but they were in the same hotel as you on the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 73 of 296 
 
face of the document, and it would also appear that your 
accommodation was charged to the account of Rajesh 
Gupta, his part of it and settled.   
 
Do you have any comment on this?  And then what 
we see  from the first document at 1949, that certain PDF 
charge slips were then sent by Mr Shwala to Tony Gupta.  
Do you have any comment on these documents?   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, these documents I have not seen 
before.  They have not been provided to us previously.  I 
think these were the documents that actually came late last 
10 
night, if I am not mistaken.  Mr Chair, if we can have leave 
to examine these documents and provide some comments 
in due course. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But what I want to ask you is do you 
stand by your version that you, because this you have put 
in your affidavit.  You were unaware of the presence of Mr 
Gupta and Mr Essa in Dubai in so far as they were there.   
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you, is it your case that you had 
no knowledge of them being at the Oberoi Hotel at the 
20 
same time as you?   
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now, and you would say I assume 
you would, that you paid for your own accommodation. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 74 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At the Oberoi? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And are you, have you got any proof 
of that?  Do you have any documentation? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair, I do not.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Would you have paid in cash? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I see.  Now these networking 
meetings that you had in Dubai, did they ever include any 
of the Guptas and Mr Essa? 
10 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did they ever include Mr Shwala? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, then let us go to the second 
trip.  This is 3 June to 8 June.  This is my schedule.  
MR SINGH:  Sorry sir, for the record as well Mr Chair, if 
you look at as we placed on record Mr Chair, the veracity 
and obviously integrity of these documents are in question 
and obviously are being checked.  [indistinct] we also point 
out that the Singh that is referred to here is an ANUJ.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are you looking at? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, 1954 Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  1954.  Yes, okay just repeat the point 
you were making?   
MR SINGH:  So I am saying that the Singh that is referred 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 75 of 296 
 
to in this information invoice, is an ANUJ Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  Not an ANOJ Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I assume that is a mistake that is 
often made in the spelling of your name?   
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair, if you look at the way that the 
hotel protocol normally work, you are required to use your 
proof of identification before you actually are allowed to 
take up your room, and that in international travel it is 
10 
normally required for you to produce your passport.  
 
If your passport does not record to the reservation 
that you have, then you have a bit of a problem.  So in this 
case this is not as simple plain way as it is a U versus an 
O.  I think it is a little bit more problematic than that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you already saying this is not a 
reference to you or are you saying no, I am not necessarily 
saying it is not a reference to me, but it may be that it is 
somebody else?   
MR SINGH:   No Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one are you saying? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, in the light of, this is what I am 
saying.  In the light of the fact that the veracity of these 
invoices are questioned Mr Chair, you cannot assume that 
this is me.  I am saying this is not me.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 76 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying that this is not you? 
MR SINGH:  No sir, because ANUJ is not ANOJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Singh.  Let us go 
to the second trip on my schedule.  This one you say is 
business.  3 June to 8 June.  It was alleged that you flew 
together with Mr R Gupta and my paraphrasing of your 
evidence and you must correct me if I am wrong, this is not 
intended to have any evidentiary weight.  
 
As I understood your evidence is that you travelled 
10 
to Frankfort and Heathrow between 4 and 6 June and you 
were in Dubai between 6 and 8.  You say it was a business 
trip.  You were unaware that Mr R Gupta was on the flight, 
and then you disputed Ms Suleiman’s version. 
 
I do not want to test you on that.  Would that 
accurately summarise it? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  [indistinct] what your evidence was? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Could we please go then to 
20 
page 1955 of the same bundle.  There is a series of 
documents within this date range, running from 1555 to 
1962.   
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER SC:  Chairperson, just for the 
record.  Is the situation pertaining to these emails similar 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 77 of 296 
 
as to what was stated earlier, i.e. the emails that is not 
related or these emails, so we have got invoices and we 
have got emails.  
 
Are the emails also emails that were obtained from 
the Gupta leaks?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So we are at 1955 and we 
need of course to read these emails  backwards.  If you go 
to the foot of that page, in fact if you go to 1956, you see it 
10 
is signed by Ashu.  When I say signed, he is the author.  
So it is from Ashu.   
 
It is to Sarah [indistinct] who I understand is 
someone from the hotel: 
 
“Hi Sarah.  As discussed I would like to book a 
luxury suite on below dates.  Check in 6, check out 9.  
Guest names, Anoj Singh.” 
 
You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then further up, again from 
20 
Sarah to Ashu: 
 
“Great speaking to you just now.  Please find 
attached confirmation letter from, for Mr Singh.  I am also 
resending the confirmation letter for Mr Gupta.” 
 
You see that? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 78 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then if we go to page 1957, you will 
see that the Gupta in question appears to be Mr Rajesh 
Gupta.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  There is a reservation for him, 
arriving 6, leaving 9 and he was in a presidential suite.  
You see that? 
MR SINGH:  Correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go to page 1959, this on the 
10 
face of it is your reservation.  You are arriving as you have 
said to us, on the 6 t h of June and departing on the 9 t h of 
June when you were in a luxury suite.  Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you in fact stay at the Oberoi 
Hotel during these or on these dates? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  On what dates did you stay at that 
hotel? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, this was an official travel.  So this 
20 
would be the hotel accommodation would have been 
booked by Transnet Mr Chair and paid for by Transnet and 
whatever hotel that would have appeared to be at the time 
would have been the hotel that I stayed at.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 79 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  At what hotel did you stay? 
MR SINGH:  I was explaining that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And I was explaining to the Chair that this was 
an official trip.  So the hotel would have been booked by 
Transnet and paid for by Transnet.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  And that is the hotel that I would have stayed 
in. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, but can you remember what 
hotel it was? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Or do you know that it was not the 
Oberoi? 
MR SINGH:  Definitely. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Why? 
MR SINGH:  Because I do not think Transnet will use the 
Oberoi Hotel as one ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You do not think they used it? 
20 
MR SINGH:  No.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right, and then if you go to 1961, so 
just perhaps let us pause for a moment.  What were you 
officially doing in Dubai between Friday the 6 t h of June and 
Monday the 9 t h of June? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 80 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do not exactly recall  but there are 
a number of reasons as to why one would have been in 
Dubai.  One of the rating agencies that [indistinct] both 
Eskom and Transnet was based in Dubai.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was? 
MR SINGH:  Was based in Dubai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  One of the rating agencies.  There were 
frequent, there were some investor road shows that we had 
done through Dubai during this period of time.  I think it 
10 
was particularly for Transnet, not for Eskom.  In terms of 
exploring the Islamic financing and investor 
appetite 
market.  
 
They were also reference visits that I think was 
arranged by McKinsey in terms of understanding the 
methods that are used to manage construction projects, 
because at that time, Dubai was going through a massive 
construction boom and there were a lot of organisations 
that had adopted different and innovative and [indistinct] 
leadership project management type of philosophies.  
20 
 
That is what we would have been looking at doing, 
in Dubai.  But Mr Chair, in terms of exactly this trip, I am 
not, I do not recall.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You are not sure? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 81 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, and then to finish off these 
documents, could you go to 1961.  
MR SINGH:  I am there sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And there at the top, in the face of it 
an email from Mr Essa to Ashu.  He is forwarding the 
Oberoi Dubai, Mr A, PDF.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If you go over the page at page 1962, 
you see some sort of hotel voucher it seems expostay.com.  
To the Oberoi Hotel.  Arrival date 6 t h, departure date 9.  
10 
Three nights.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  I am just trying to figure out where you are.  
Okay, yes I see that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright, and then if we go to the third 
trip on my schedule from 7 to 12 August, as I understand 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  The page that 
you are moving away from was it 1962? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  that is an accommodation voucher, 
20 
is that right?  Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reservation on the face of it 
appears to have been done on the 5 t h of June 2015, and 
the arrival date was 6 June 2014.  Departure date 9 June 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 82 of 296 
 
and that you were reflected there as the client and the 
spelling was the correct spelling of your name.  
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and this was the Oberoi Hotel in 
Dubai.  Okay, alright.  Mr ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then if we [word cut] 999 schedule, 
that is 7 to 12 August 2014.  As I understand it 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   7 to 12 August Chairperson, 2014, 
the third trip on my schedule. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, alright, yes.  That is the one 
he says he didn’t undertake. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So as I understand it previously Mr 
Singh, and you must correct me if I am wrong, when Mr 
Seleka was examining you I understood that you accepted 
that you went on this trip but you had issues with the 
invoices and you pointed out a whole lot of discrepancies. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I understand your evidence today 
you say that when you returned home and you discussed 
this with members of your family and you came to the 
conclusion that actually you incorrect, you hadn’t engaged 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 83 of 296 
 
on this trip.   
MR SINGH:   That is correct.    
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you had intended to. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I take you please to page 
1781, now that’s earlier in the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1781?  Record the page right Mr 
Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, 1781 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I’ve got it. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want to ask you a few questions in 
relation to the documents you find at 1781 through to 1784. 
MR SINGH:   1784. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson is this in Bundle 
23, because we don’t have those pages in our bundle. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   This is Exhibit 23, 1781. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is the bundle that we have been using 
this morning 5C.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what you find at 1781, perhaps 
you must start at the bottom, reservation ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson sorry again to 
interrupt, we don’t seem to have that – those documents, 
and my attorney also says the same, so ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got the right bundle? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Yes Chairperson we have got it 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 84 of 296 
 
on line, well not online, we have downloaded the reference 
bundles that were sent to us electronically and if we go 
through it we don’t seem to have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t have page 1781? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  No, ours ends at ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yours ends where? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Just bear with me for a second.   
No, so on this bundle we have got 1971 but if you look at 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you’ve got 1971 you should also 
10 
have 1781, the page that Mr Myburgh has referred us to is 
1781 and then you go up to 17 ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson if you can just bear 
with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   So 1719 in BB23 seems to be a 
document – I just want to go to the start of it, it is Alistair 
Chauby’s submissions to the Commission, now 1788 and 
then it goes to 1789, Chairperson I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you have at 1781? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson I see it is almost lunch 
time, perhaps this is something that my learned friend and 
I can sort out and not hold up the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.   Let us just get those 
things sorted out so when we come back we can just run 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 85 of 296 
 
smoothly.    
 
Okay we are going to adjourn for lunch and we will 
resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Singh 
we were dealing [no audio] ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Singh 
we were dealing with the 7 to 12 August 2014 trip that you 
say you planned but did not undertake.   Before lunch I 
think I had taken you to page 1781 of Bundle 5C, Exhibit 
23.   
You see at the foot of that page from the Oberoi 
Hotel on the 4 t h of August there is a reservation which is 
attached over the page and it reflects a reservation 
confirmation for Mr Anoj Singh, arrival date the 7 t h of 
August departure date the 12 t h.  So those were the plan 
20 
days, dates of your trip, correct? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I do not recall the exact dates of 
the planned trip but I guess if it is those dates then it is 
those dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Myburgh I am at 1781 but I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 86 of 296 
 
suspect you are not there on that page. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
1781, 
the 
reservation, 
his 
confirmation is at 1782, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And was it your - had it been your 
intention to stay at the Oberoi Hotel? 
MR SINGH:   Not that I recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But as I understood your evidence, 
that is where you stayed when you went on personal 
private trips to Dubai.  
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sometimes it was for vacations we did 
stay at other hotels. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I beg your pardon.  
MR SINGH:   At some stages when they were vacations we 
did stay at other hotels.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But when you were there on this 
expanding your network, you stayed at the Oberoi? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh is this then another 
coincidence because on the face of it, this was also the 
20 
Gupta’s hotel where they stayed, I do not mean they owned 
it but they also stayed there are lots of hotels in Dubai, I 
have not been there as often as you but they are lots. 
MR SINGH:   That is true, sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So is this to another coincidence, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 87 of 296 
 
coincidentally 
you 
were 
with 
their 
travel 
agent, 
coincidentally you stay at the same hotel.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I am going to 
object, I have not heard any evidence led before this 
Commission, where my client testified that the – Travel 
Excellence was the travel agency of the Gupta’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure that Mr Myburgh said it 
was  
the travel agent of the Gupta’s.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chair, perhaps I should refine that, 
10 
what there is evidence of is Travel Excellence being a 
travel agent of Mr Essa and Sahara Computers, so let me 
qualify it that way.  Now is this a coincidence then Mr 
Singh that of all the hotels in Dubai, you just happen to 
stay at the one that they seem to also stay at? 
MR SINGH:   I guess so Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you, you go to Dubai 
often. How many hotels do you think they are in Dubai? 
MR SINGH:   Lots. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you mean lots like how many? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Hundreds. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Hundreds? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how many travel agents are 
there in Johannesburg do you think? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 88 of 296 
 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, really I am going 
to object to this line of cross examination.  It is – let me 
just stop there before I say something that I should not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   If my learned friend wants to 
put…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, well, I guess we all know 
there are lots. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I do not want to convert 
you into some sort of expert I am sorry.  So what we then 
going back to page 1781, in the middle: 
“Dear Ashu.” 
That presumably is Chawla: 
“Please find attached the revised confirmation letter 
with double occupancy.” 
And then there is a response from him at the top of the 
page. 
“Please swipe the card for all charges.” 
20 
Have you got any comments to make on these documents? 
MR SINGH:   Well Mr Chair, if you look at 1781, for 
example Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry when I look at? 
MR SINGH:   1781. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 89 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SINGH:   What is anomalous in this email, Mr Chair, is 
that the email right at the bottom, if we look at the – there 
is from Oberoi Dubai reservations, and there is an email 
address and then sent to - sent Monday 04 of August 2014 
for 11pmto Sarah.  So that timestamp is for 11pm.  Yet if 
you then look at the email then in the middle of the day, 
you see from Sarah to Ashu but that is a 2:17pm. 
I am not too sure how Sarah send something to 
Ashu before reservations, actually send it to her for 11pm.  
10 
So, again, Mr Chair the anomalies in these documents 
continue, as we have discussed, and pointed out in the 
past.   
Then, Mr Chair, again, if this was the planned trip 
and the planned trip obviously did not materialise.  Again, I 
am not too sure why Mr Ashu is charging anything, 
because it was just being a matter of having to cancel the 
reservation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But when did you cancel the trip, do 
you know it might have been shortly before you left? 
20 
MR SINGH:   I would not recall it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, did Mr Chawla ever book hotel 
accommodation for you?  
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ah, let us then deal with the fourth 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 90 of 296 
 
trip on my list 6to 9 November and it was stated in the 
1060 that you flew on the same light as Mr Essa and what 
you said about that, in your evidence is that you did not 
deny that he was on the same flight but you were not 
aware of this, is that right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you flew to Dubai, did you fly 
business class or did you fly economy class? 
MR SINGH:   I would think if I recall correctly it was 
business. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you fly business class? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what airline would you usually 
fly? 
MR SINGH:   It would be Emirates. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this is not really a matter of not 
having seen Mr Essa at the airport, he would have may or 
may not have been in business class. 
MR SINGH:   Probably. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let us deal with…[intervene]  
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, just for the record 
there is also first class, so there is a very big distinction 
between first class and business class, to who can see who 
and who has got access to it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 91 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you fly - what is it first class or 
did you fly business class? 
MR SINGH:   Me? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   No, as I said business class. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, not first class.  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   The probability or possibility 
exists, that whoever else was on the flight that my learned 
friend refers to could have flown business class or for that 
10 
matter economy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, hang on – you remember that you 
will get a chance to re-examine. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I know that I have 
got an opportunity to re-examine but I am also need to 
prevent unfairness and speculative and innuendo being put 
to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well obviously, you can object but I am 
just saying you can object in certain circumstances but I 
am saying just remember that you have that opportunity to 
20 
re-examine later on and obviously when you re-examine, if 
you think there is something that was not put correctly to 
the witness and then you can use that opportunity to put it 
correctly.  Yes, Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Mr Singh I now want to 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 92 of 296 
 
take you to the other bundle, Bundle 5B also part of Exhibit 
23.  Would you please turn to page 770, seven, seven, 
zero?  
MR SINGH:   I am there, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we see at the foot of 770 is 
a reservation confirmation and if you go over the page, at 
771 you will see that you are reflected as the guest arrival 
date, Friday 7 November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I…[intervene] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   771, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   771, okay I think she did not hear that, 
okay I have got 771 on Transnet Bundle 5.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, 771 reflects the 
reservation confirmation you as the guest, arriving 7 
November, departing 9 November.  Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you stay in the Oberoi Hotel 
during those - over that period?  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just try and speak up Mr Singh. 
20 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair I was just far away - let me 
just do this again, like when we did last.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If I can take you to page 770 there is 
Lima from the hotel to Ashu: 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 93 of 296 
 
“Please find below the confirmation letter for Mr 
Singh.” 
And then from Ashu at the top of the page on 6 November 
to Sanjay Grover.  Do you know him? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say you did stay in the Oberoi 
on these dates? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I take you then to the fifth trip 
on my list.  That is a trip from the 25 t h of February to the 
10 
1 s t of March.  It was recorded in the 10.6 that Mr Rajesh 
Gupta and Mr Essa, were present in Dubai over this period 
and your evidence was that you were unaware of their 
presence, correct?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I would like to take you to two sets 
of documents in relation to this trip.  The first you find at 
pages 775 in the same bundle that you in through to 782.  
But let us start at 775 from the hotel, dated the 23 r d of 
February: 
20 
“Dear Mr Ashu. 
Greetings from the Oberoi, Dubai we are pleased to 
confirm airport transfer as requested from Mr Singh 
as an additional supplement of AED 200 per car, per 
way.” 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 94 of 296 
 
Do you see that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you stayed at the Oberoi, 
would you use the hotel transfer as a means of getting to 
and from the hotel? 
MR SINGH:   I did occasionally but not on all of it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you see that that is a response 
to the email at the foot of the page from Ashu to 
reservations that says: 
“Please arrange airport pickup for the same, arrival 
10 
flight EK766.” 
You see that? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
And 
then 
the 
reservation 
confirmation reflects you as arriving on the 24 t h of 
February and leaving on the 26 t h off February.  You see 
that? 
MR SINGH:   Page you are reading, sir? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Page 776. 
MR SINGH:   776, yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I take you please to page 780/ 
MR SINGH:   Seven eight zero? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Seven eight zero.  Now, this is on 
the face of it an invoice.  
MR SINGH:   Sorry, seven I do not have 780. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 95 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Seven eight zero. 
MR SINGH:   I do not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I also do not have it, I have got 779 and 
then 782, no 780 and 781 are not here. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 Alright, 
well, 
it 
seems 
that 
Chairperson I am going to have to arrange hard copies of 
these two missing pages overnight.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I will come back to this tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But perhaps Mr Singh…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would they be able to - I think they can 
organise it whilst you are going on if there is a copy 
available. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, do you have 782? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got 782.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and that - so what you will 
see Mr Singh when we get the document 780 and 781 are 
two pages of an invoice and then there is another invoice 
at 782. Are you at 782 now? 
20 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see it is in your name, it is 
addressed to – or the company is reflected as Sahara 
Computers.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:   I do, sir. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 96 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the arrival and departure dates 
is 24 February and 1 March, and it reflects payment using 
MasterCard 8816.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:   I see it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you see that it appears that Ms 
Nike[?] joined you on this trip? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you pay for this yourself?  
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you have any proof of that? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir I do not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would you have paid cash?  
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That R18 309,00 that - was that, would 
that be the total of everything namely what you paid on 
departure when you checked out? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct sir, except that it is not rand’s 
it is…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, except that it is not rands as you 
mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh…[intervene] 
MR SINGH:   It is…[intervene] 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 97 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the Dubai money again I forget? 
MR SINGH:   Dirham’s 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and what is the exchange rate 
more or less between them? 
MR SINGH:  Probably about fifty-four to sixty thousand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   Between fifty and sixty thousand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Between fifteen thousand rand? 
MR SINGH:   No, no between fifty and sixty thousand rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay but you – so you say 18,309 
10 
Dubai currency would be about 50 to R60 000,00 in South 
African currency? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that you carried 
about  
50 to R60 000,00 of cash that you used to pay?  
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, the arrangement I explained to 
you previously with Mr Abalutshi, was the arrangement that 
we had a quid pro quo that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, the arrangement that you had 
20 
with whom? 
MR SINGH:   The arrangement that we - that I explained to 
you previously with Mr Abalutshi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR SINGH:   Would be in the vein of the fact that or the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 98 of 296 
 
advice and consultations that I was providing to him at the 
time.  He would then reimburse me in terms of being able 
to pay for my accommodation and expenses in Dubai at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not remember you mentioning 
the arrangement about payment for accommodation, I 
remember that you told us about him, ja.  So you say the 
arrangement was that he was paying you for consultations 
that you had with him, but the arrangement was that 
instead of him paying - giving you the money he would pay 
10 
for your accommodation? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, he would physically provide 
me the cash and I will settle the bill but the arrangement 
was that for the times that I was there, given the fact that 
it was a mutually beneficial arrangement that he and I had, 
in terms of exchange of information that I would pay for my 
travels and he would pay for the accommodation at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So - but you say you paid cash? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   50 to R60 000,00 cash at the hotel? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say you got that cash from him? 
MR SINGH:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And he gave it to you, in cash? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 99 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so, Mr Singh, what - this is 
part of your moonlighting.  So you - just so that I 
understand this, are you telling me that whilst you were the 
Group Chief Financial Officer at Transnet you would go to 
Dubai and you would then advise and consult with this 
gentleman, and he would then pay you in this instance the 
equivalent of R60 000,00 to settle your hotel bill? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What is it you were advising and 
consulting about? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, there were various topics as I said 
in my case, Mr Chair, I was really looking to establish 
myself 
 
in an environment other than South Africa and Dubai was 
an environment where a lot of South Africans expats settle 
down.  The Dubai environment is an environment that is 
known for its - as a financial hub and that was the reason I 
20 
engaged in a relationship with Mr Abalutshi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it his idea or your idea that he 
should give you cash and not electronically transfer money 
to you or in any other way, whose idea was it? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, in terms of establishing bank 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 100 of 296 
 
accounts and the like in the UAE it is problematic if you 
are not a resident.  So it was an understanding that we 
came to at that point in time, as a matter of convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But whose idea was it? 
MR SINGH:   I cannot exactly recall Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It just seems very peculiar that in South 
Africa witness 3 has said that you used to go to the Gupta 
residents and collect cash and that cash would go to Knox 
Vaults not to the bank and the lady from Travel Excellence, 
the travel agency says in her affidavit there were certain 
10 
times, a number of times when you had to settle certain 
invoices relating to bookings that they have made for you, 
you would call them and say send the driver and the driver 
would come there with cash and from her evidence 
sometimes it is not small amounts of cash. 
Now you are in Dubai want and you are supposed to 
settle the hotel bill which is quite high 50 to R60 000,00 
and you use cash to settle it on your version. 
MR 
SINGH: 
 
 
Mr 
Chair, 
I 
think 
maybe 
it 
is 
worthwhile…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is like you are Mr Cash. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think is worthwhile explaining the 
environment in Dubai, I think the environment in Dubai is 
relatively less like South Africa, in that cash is a very 
common currency of payment, and even large sums of cash 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 101 of 296 
 
and large transactions are actually sometimes settled in 
cash.   
And I guess it is because of the safety factor in 
Dubai is much better than here so you obviously have the 
latitude of, you know, settling in cash rather than using 
electronic funds transfer unlike what we use here, so I 
think that will probably explain the reason why cash is a 
more 
frequent 
mechanism 
that 
is 
used 
to 
settle 
transactions in Dubai.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, you would realise would 
10 
you not or you concede that, therefore Mr – or witness 3’s  
evidence of you having cash, taking cash from the Gupta’s, 
the residence, Gupta’s residence to Knox Vaults -  in other 
words not any other form of money but actual cash is 
consistent with the form of money that you like using, you 
like using cash. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson…[intervene]  
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, from what you have said to me it 
looked like you liked – you have preferred dealing in cash, 
20 
not cheques and electronic transfers, am I wrong? 
MR SINGH:   Not necessarily, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You also use the other means? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, I use cards, I used electronic funds 
transfers, I use debit orders like every other person.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 102 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh I just want to take you 
back. I mean, I understand how you were trying to make 
connections in Dubai.  But what I still do not have clear my 
mind is what advice, consultative advice were you giving to 
this connection of yours in Dubai that was to the value of -  
we are throwing the figure of R60 000,00 around, to pay 
the hotel bill?  What advice?  
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair, he was - as I said, it was a 
mutually 
beneficial 
relationship. 
He 
is 
a 
self-made 
10 
businessman, has interest in property and various retail 
travel endeavours, or businesses and he was looking to 
expand and one of the areas that he was looking to expand 
into was Africa.   
And South Africa being the gateway into Africa, he 
was looking to understand if there were opportunities to 
expand into South Africa, and more so into Africa and 
obviously, my background in terms of understanding the 
South African environment, having the exposure to the - let 
us say, logistics environment in South Africa because of 
20 
Transnet proved to be valuable to him, as well as 
obviously…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please speak up so that it will be 
recorded, ja. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, and also the financial background that I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 103 of 296 
 
carried with that, obviously, was of interest to him to 
understand, how does he go about actually doing and 
setting up these potential businesses that he may actually 
want to endeavour in coming into South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you meet this man and where 
and how? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I think it was…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the first time. 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall exactly when Mr Chair, but it 
was as a - if I recall, it was at a networking function that I 
10 
attended in Dubai.  I think it was one of the business trips 
that I had undertaken with Transnet and there was a 
networking dinner that we needed to attend.   
And there was an open session where people had 
to, could - there was a panel, and then there was questions 
and answers that we could then pose to the panel.  And we 
engaged with the panel and I had asked a couple of 
questions, and I think, Mr Abalutshi was also part of the 
session, and post that session, he came up to me and said, 
listen, he understands that I am from South Africa and that 
20 
is how we got speaking, and then got to understand my 
background, and so on, that is how it happened Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So thank you.  Just on page 782. 
MR SINGH:   Seven? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 104 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   782, you - we were dealing with this 
invoice. It reflects there on the face of it, payment by way 
of a MasterCard ending at 8816, I take it that is not your 
card? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would you keep this file open at 782 
and then could you turn to the other file, please?  Right to 
the back to page 1971.   
MR SINGH:  71?  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1971. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is on Transnet Bundle 5(c). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You see there you see a picture of a 
credit card. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  A Mastercard, correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And do you see that it ends with the 
digits 8816? 
20 
MR SINGH:  I see that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now if you go to page 1870 there is a 
document there that reflects that that is actually Sanjay 
Grover’s credit card.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  I see that. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 105 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Because he was authorising the 
payment at the time at a different hotel and he puts out his 
card number and there is his name, do you see that? 
MR SINGH:  I do Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson we have managed to get 
copies made of pages 780 and 781 if I could perhaps hand 
that up to your? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Associate and ask her to put it in your 
file.  Has Mr Singh been – Mr Singh I think you have been 
10 
given 780 and 81 would you not just put that into File 5(b) 
please?  So those documents perhaps I could just take you 
to them.  There is nothing there of any particular interest 
because it is the first two pages really of the invoice that 
concludes at 782.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
Now 
there 
is 
some 
additional 
documents that I want to take you to in relation to this trip.  
You find those documents in Bundle 5(c) and could I ask you 
please to turn to page 1963. 
20 
MR SINGH:  5(c)? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
MR SINGH:  1963?  1963. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1963 running through to 1971.  Are you 
there?  1963 are you there? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 106 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So that is on the face of it is an email 
from your travel agent Ms Suleiman on the 25t h of February 
to Ashu and it is cc’d to you.  
“Please see attached air ticket for Ms Nike.” 
She did go on this trip with you as you have already said, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not see cc to him Mr Myburgh I see cc 
to Salim Essa. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry to Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon.  It is cc’d to Mr 
Essa do you see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You want to comment on this? 
MR SINGH:  No Mr Chair I do not want to comment on it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I beg your pardon. 
ADV 
VAN 
DEN 
HEEVER: 
 
I 
cannot 
hear 
my 
client 
Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes speak up Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry Mr Chair.  I think it is because of this 
00:04:18.  Let me do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You can bring it closer if possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You want to comment on this 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 107 of 296 
 
document? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Mr – No Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just so that I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry did you say no? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Just so that we understand it as of the 
25t h of February 2015 Ms Nike was actually working for 
Sahara Computers, correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And her boss would have been Ashu 
10 
Chawla? 
MR SINGH:  I would not… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You described him as the CEO. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I see.  And then if we go to 1964, 1964 
over the page there is an air ticket flying on the 25t h of 
February returning on the 1s t of March and business class, is 
that right? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So just that I understand it is it your 
20 
evidence that you paid for this ticket? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Is it your evidence that you paid for 
this ticket? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 108 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Not.  Alright.  Who paid for it? 
MR SINGH:  I would assume Sahara Computers. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Right.  I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you only assume that it was 
Sahara Computers?  Were you not travelling with Eva, was 
she travelling alone? 
MR SINGH:  I think she arrived a couple of days later Mr 
Chair if you look at the date. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR SINGH:  I say Mr Chair if you look at the date I think she 
arrived a couple of days later compared to myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She arrived after you had … 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She arrived after you? 
MR SINGH:  Yes 25 when is the 25t h?  I am not too sure 
what the date of my flight was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe Mr Myburgh can remind us 
when did Mr Singh travel? 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well – yes the annotation on my 
schedule of trip 5 and this is what was in … 
MR SINGH:  This is 25. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And this is what was in – what was in 
the 1006 was 25 February 1 March. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 109 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR SINGH:  Oh yes, yes I see that.  No I think we did then 
travel together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which case I would image you would 
know whether she was paid for by – or you – both of you 
were paid for by Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:  No that is why I say she was probably paid for 
Sahara because she was not paid (inaudible). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  On herself? 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – 
MR SINGH:  No by Sahara. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no what I mean is are you saying 
Sahara paid for her but not for you – you paid for yourself? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  Sorry I could not hear the last 
part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am asking whether you are saying 
Sahara Computers paid for Ms Nike? 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you paid for yourself your own travel 
expenses. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Myburgh. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 110 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So this was not a business trip that Ms 
Nike was undertaking this was a personal trip? 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair if I recall correctly there was 
some business associated with this trip with Ms Nike that 
she was undertaking there but details of which I – I do not 
have the details. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You do not have the details? 
MR SINGH:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I see.  Alright so let us go to page 
1966.  So there is an email in the middle of the page from 
10 
Sanjay Grover but then at the top of the page from Ashu to 
Tony Gupta forward Oberio Dubai copy of your invoice AS 
those are your initials, correct? 
MR SINGH:  Could be. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we then go over the page one finds 
an invoice on the face of it addressed to you in the name of 
the company Sahara Computers, correct? 
MR SINGH:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Reflects an arrival on the 24t h of 
February and a departure on the 1s t of May.  It reflects at the 
20 
foot of the page a debit for the picking up of Ms Nike, 
correct?  The foot of 1965 the collection of her presumably 
at the airport. 
MR SINGH:  196. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1967 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 111 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  1967 yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if you go 1968 is a 
continuation of the bill.  We get to 1969 another bill coming 
to 18 000AED which you have told us already is some 
R60 000;00. 
MR SINGH:  And this is the same – one and the same one 
right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This is for a different trip. 
10 
MR SINGH:  No it is the same trip. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  No but before we get to that did you 
pay the bill on this trip Mr Singh 25 February to 1 March – 
did you pay it? 
MR SINGH:  Yes Sir as I have mentioned before. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And how did you pay it? 
MR SINGH:  It was paid in cash. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And where did you get the cash from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is the same one that we have 
covered Mr Myburgh.  Remember when I asked him whether 
20 
it was his idea or .. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Oh I beg your pardon.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we – we have asked him those 
questions ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes Chair.  And I have taken you – I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 112 of 296 
 
am sorry to the credit card the 8816. 
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And I have showed you that it is Mr 
Grover’s card so I beg your pardon.  I am not going to tax 
you twice about it.  And then could we please go to the last 
trip on my list and that is the 11 to 15 June trip.  It was again 
alleged this time that Mr A Gupta and Mr R Gupta were 
present in Dubai together with Mr Essa and you testified that 
you paid for the ticket, you referred to certain discrepancies 
and invoices and you say that you were unaware of their 
10 
presence in Dubai. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I want to take you please to a series of 
documents again in relation to this final trip.  Could we start 
by going to page 1785?   
MR SINGH:  1785. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1785.   
MR SINGH:  17? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1785.   
MR SINGH:  Yes. 
20 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
There 
you 
find 
a 
reservation 
confirmation in your name arriving on the 13 t h of June and 
departing on the 15t h of June you see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Again at the top you see there is an 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 113 of 296 
 
email from Ashu and it is sent this time to Sanjay Grover.  
Reservation confirmation at the Oberoi Dubai Anoj Singh you 
see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And could I take you in relation to this 
trip then to page 1972.  At 1972 there is at the top on the 
face of it an email from reservations on the 11 t h of June to 
Ashu.  It says re booking for Sahara Computers.  Dear Mr 
Chawla as per our telecon we have duly amended the 
reservation for Mr Anoj Singh as below.  And then it sets out 
10 
that you were in a luxury suite, you see that? 
MR SINGH:  Where is that? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you stay at the Oberoi Hotel… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember to come closer to the mic 
when you respond Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you stay again at the Oberoi Hotel 
during this June trip of yours? 
MR SINGH:  Yes I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you stay in a luxury suite? 
20 
MR SINGH:  I do not recall Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now on that page 1972 it refers to 
Room 2 you see that? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry on 1 – on 17? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1972 the page that we just talking 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 114 of 296 
 
about. 
MR SINGH:  Where is it? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Under Room 02 talks about a – the lux 
city room and says it includes breakfast etcetera and the last 
bullet point says as per your request we will try and have the 
rooms arranged near to each other.  Do you have any idea 
who that person or other person might have been? 
MR SINGH:  No Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  If we go over the page to 1973 an 
email from Reservations the previous day subject re booking 
10 
for Sahara Computers.  Dear Mr Chawla greetings from the 
Oberoi Dubai we have duly noted the change in departure 
date of Mr Gupta and the reservation has been amended 
accordingly.  You see that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then if I could take you please to 
page 1976.  So at the foot of the page of 1976 we see the 
reservation confirmation for Anoj Singh we have already 
dealt with that and the attachment but I just want to direct 
your attention to the top of the page where there is an email 
20 
from Ashu on the 11 t h of June to Salim Essa do you see that? 
MR SINGH:  I see that Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Singh just so that I understand 
your position in relation to all of these – these invoices do I 
understand you to be saying that they are – all of them are 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 115 of 296 
 
not authentic? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Mr Chair because the question 
(inaudible). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  You need to go – you going to need to 
speak up. 
MR SINGH:  Sorry – sorry yes Sir.  We questioned the 
authenticity of these documents Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And you do so on the basis that you 
say well Gupta was not there, Essa was not there, Chawla 
did not arrange my booking, who arranged these bookings?  
10 
We know that you stayed at this Oberoi Hotel – how did you 
make your bookings? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair there were sometimes made by myself 
or they were made by Mr Abelushi.[?] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Made by yourself or other – sometimes by 
who? 
MR SINGH:  By Mr Abelushi.[?] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And just as much as you question the 
authenticity of these invoices do you have any invoices of 
20 
your own? 
MR SINGH:  Not for the period in question but I think I do 
have one or two invoices Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But not in relation to these trips? 
MR SINGH:  No, no.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 116 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So you put your eggs… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson before my learned 
friend move on just for our own understanding I – on page 
1876 my learned friend refers to an email and I have taken 
note that there is a lot of attachments to this email can he 
just direct us to where we can find these attachments? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We – we have not come across these 
attachments.   When I asked the investigators and I will take 
a further instruction what I was told is that this is a series of 
– when I say we have not come across them what I was told 
10 
it was a series of like marketing type – you can go to this 
restaurant or you can go to that restaurant.  I will take an 
instruction on that and see if – if they can be found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And if they are found Chairperson we 
will then add – add them in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Into this bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well of course only if they are relevant. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well we will share them with our 
learned friend and then we can make a call on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because… 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Then a last point in this regard re 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 117 of 296 
 
this particular email is an example has no reference to the 
hotel itself – to the Oberoi or the travel agency that we 
referred to earlier.  So I again just wish to confirm is this 
particular email between Ashu of Sahara and Salim Essa is it 
also an email that came from the Gupta Leaks? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes I think that we have made that 
clear Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright so what I was saying just before 
my learned friend made her point is that you really put all 
10 
your eggs in the basket of the authenticity of – or the lack of 
authenticity? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Of these invoices is that right? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I would like if I may to go back to 
this schedule.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  This is page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1757. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Myburgh sorry.  I just want to 
make sure that we are on the same page Mr Singh or I mean 
on the same page as you are.  When you challenged the 
authenticity of these invoices and emails are you saying 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 118 of 296 
 
somebody must have fabricated these invoices and emails 
they are not genuine? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and – and you – you are not sure who 
might – who that might be or are you saying whoever they 
purported to have come from must have manipulated them? 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair as confirmed they come from the 
leaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  So we do not exactly know who the leaks 
10 
(inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes thank you.  Could I ask you please 
to go back to page 1757 and in particular the – the 
annotated page that I handed up.   
MR SINGH:  This one? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1571? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1757. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  That is the Knox Vault customer – 
customer visit schedule Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am getting confused whether it is 
15 (speaking over each other). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry 17 – 1757 I might have got them 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 119 of 296 
 
mixed up myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Okay I have got it.  Oh – 
ja I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the – that is the document we 
looked at where you blocked. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes and I – if you still have my 
annotated page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is the one. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  It might be easier. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I have got it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now Mr Singh you ascribed at a point 
in your evidence the fact that you got more and more boxes 
to the fact that you were going through a divorce.  Can I just 
ask you when is it that you got divorced? 
MR SINGH:  I think it was sometime in 2017 or 2018. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So it was a long time – it was some 
years after those bracketed visits. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson in fact the witness’ 
evidence was – it was at the time he went through a 
20 
separation he did not use the word divorce. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  No well that is fair enough.  
So you were divorced in 2017 or 18? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So at – my next question I was going 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 120 of 296 
 
to ask you was when did you leave the marital home? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson maybe at this point 
because there is other persons involved we should consider 
that this evidence not be publicly broadcasted.  It is 
somebody else’s – there is a third party involved who is not 
part of these proceedings.  There is children and this is 
private.  When you deal with Chairperson as – when it comes 
to marital issues that is indeed private. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the question of the dates I do not see 
that it should be a problem. The date when she – he left the 
10 
marital home.  I do not think that – should be a problem.  
Okay you can answer that Mr Singh. 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair – exactly recall but as I said it was the 
process of separation of a period or as it – as you can see 
extended period.  But I do not recall exactly when that date 
would have been. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But in what year? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember the year either. 
MR SINGH:  No. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you say that then it looks like then 
you would not be able to rely on that to say during one of 
these visits you – you used – you may have gone to Knox 
Vault to put in some personal items because you were 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 121 of 296 
 
leaving the marital home because that suggests you know 
when it was and it would coincide with this period. 
MR SINGH:  Well Mr Chair when I responded at the time I 
said I – it would have coincided with this period – with this 
timing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but when you say that you are giving 
the impression that you know that you left the marital home 
around this time. 
MR SINGH:  Well then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But based on what you have just said it 
10 
looks like you have no idea even which year. 
MR SINGH:  I seem to recall it was in this period of time so 
it will probably have been in 2014 if I am pushed to give a 
year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no you are not being  pushed to 
say one or another you just need to give your evidence 
truthfully as you  - as you know it. 
MR SINGH:  As I would recall it Mr Chair to the best of my 
ability it would be around 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My Myburgh. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  So it is around 2014.  So what 
I just wanted to ask you is how your evidence in relation to 
Knox Vaults started is by me saying to you but why do you 
store valuables at Knox Vault and your answer is well this is 
a crime ridden country and as a family we decided that these 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 122 of 296 
 
valuable items must be stored at Knox Vaults.  Now your 
evidence seems to progress when you show and well you 
taking a large box – two more large boxes then another large 
box then an extra extra large box. Then it progresses to well 
I am going – I will get my language right through a process 
of separation and I am actually storing my personal affects 
there not my valuables.  Is that correct?  Do I have your 
evidence correct? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So the whole purpose of Knox Vaults at 
10 
the end was to store your personal affect that is what you 
ascribe the increase in the boxes? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But yet when I asked you at the 
beginning what you use Knox Vaults for you did not say 
anything of this sort.  It is only when you confronted with 
how you incrementally increase your holding of these boxes 
that you then – you value it why? 
MR SINGH:  Well as I explained to you before Mr Chair I 
think originally I did not really recall the number of boxes 
20 
that I had there.  I did cover the aspect of saying in some 
cases personal effects were stored.  Maybe as I explained 
the extent and – the extent to which and the – as I – as I 
explained the measure and extent that has now been 
explained to me this is when I now realised that this is what 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 123 of 296 
 
was happening at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So Mr Singh in 2014 when you left the 
marital home where did you go to live? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair I was living with Ms Nike at the time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So why did you then not just leave 
your non-valuable personal effects at her house?  Why did 
you have to place your non-valuable personal effects at Knox 
Vaults?  I mean did you… 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair at the time Ms Nike had a relatively 
small apartment and so it was not practical to store items 
10 
there. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry.  Mr Singh we talking about five 
– five boxes you do not need a triple garage and a golf cart 
to store those. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson I am going to object.  
It is unnecessary to get sarcastic with the witness. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So I will – let me rephrase my 
questions.  You do not need a lot of storage space within a 
house to store that do you?  I mean you must accept that? 
MR SINGH:   Equally so Mr Chair and equally so is that the 
20 
choice of me storing my personal effects that was still 
subject to a separation in an environment that was not – 
let us say an environment where Ms Nike was.  It was also 
a 
choice 
I 
had 
to 
make 
at 
the 
time, 
given 
the 
circumstances. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 124 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Singh, what are we talking 
about here, personal effects?  What personal effects?  
Look, you have excepted that they are not valuable. 
MR SINGH:   Well, they may have been valuable for me. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, who – what personal effects 
were they? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   We would – sorry, Chairperson.  
Let the witness answer.  It does not help to interrupt him 
when he is busy giving an answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Answer Mr Singh. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, there were various items of 
documents, personal effects, like, you know, computers, 
radios.  If I recall correctly, there was an antique – how 
can you call it – a box of sorts that I needed to store in 
there.  So they were really personal effects Mr Chair that I 
stored in there and documents as I said before, from what I 
can recall.  I do not recall particularly, at this stage, 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So you accept these are not 
20 
valuable things? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just Mr Singh ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is no, yes in this case?  When you say 
no, you mean yes? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 125 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   [laughs]  Yes, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Yes?  You mean yes? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you have, it seems a few boxes 
of not valuable personal effects.  What you suggesting you 
do, you go off to Knox Vault and then at the cost of – it 
was, I think we agreed, R 10 000,00 a year you hire an 
extra extra-large box to put in these non-valuable goods.   
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And when I first you ask what you 
10 
used it for, you accept, you never mentioned this at all. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yet, it now becomes your case as to 
predominantly what was being stored in the boxes. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  When you went on these trips 
to Dubai that you style as personal or private.  Did you 
ever meet anybody from SCR in Dubai? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I have already mentioned 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  That answer was no? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 126 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   So when you say CSR, China Services 
Railways, I assume? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...did you meet anyone from any 
railway company in Dubai? 
MR SINGH:   Except – Transnet, no.  No ways. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   No other companies. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You said something about Transnet? 
10 
MR SINGH:   I thought I would say no railway companies 
that traded with Transnet but I did not meet any railway 
companies at all.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you have said that you did not 
meet any of the Gupta brothers? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you did not meet Mr Essa? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you did not meet Mr Chawla? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now just on that, I mean being 
Ms Nike’s boss.  Presumably you knew this man? 
MR SINGH:   As I said, I did not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   As I said I did not. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 127 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but did you meet him? 
MR SINGH:   At the Gupta residence, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You met him at the Gupta residence? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   During these cultural ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...or religious functions? 
MR SINGH:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who else did you meet there? 
MR SINGH:   I think I already testified before, Mr Chair.  It 
10 
was the Gupta family members.  I do not recall meeting 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, it has been extended here to 
Mr Chawla. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he was part of the Sahara? 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What other businesspeople linked to 
the Gupta’s did you meet there? 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall specifically, Mr Chair, meeting 
20 
any other businesspeople. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not meet Mr Essa? 
MR SINGH:   Sorry? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not meet Mr Essa? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 128 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So these Diwali functions – and you 
must correct me if I am wrong.  I mean, it seems to be a 
very important day on the religious calendar. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And if I understand correctly.  When 
you invite someone to celebrate Diwali with you, would you 
typically invite those people that are important and close to 
you or would it be an all come situation? 
MR SINGH:   It depends, sir.  In my case, it is relatively a 
personal affairs and it is really very close family members 
10 
only. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you went to celebrate Diwali with 
the Guptas? 
MR SINGH:   No, Mr Chair, I said that I attended various 
religious functions at their house.  I did not specifically 
mention the Diwali function. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, you did.   
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is how I come to ask you about 
it.   
20 
MR SINGH:   In this file? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You can have a look at the 
transcript.  But so are you now saying and perhaps I have 
it wrong, you might have referring to some other religious 
function.  Are you now saying you did not go to celebrate 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 129 of 296 
 
Diwali with the Guptas? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I may attended one or two of them.  
Maybe one.  But I do not, off-hand, recall attending a 
Diwali. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what were the cultural events that 
you went there for? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, if you look at the Hindu calendar.  
The Hindu calendar has many – I mean for example now, 
we are in a period of what is called Ram Navami which is 
religious function that requires you to observe a nine-day 
10 
period 
and 
this 
would 
normally 
either 
come 
in 
the 
beginning of a play or ending of a play during this nine-day 
period.  So if you look at the religious calendar there are 
number of these religious ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just mention maybe three or four for me. 
MR SINGH:   But as I said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The names. 
MR SINGH:   As I said there is Ram Navami now.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR SINGH:   There is Saraswathi, there is Diwali, as 
20 
mentioned, again there is another Saraswathi(?) which is 
later in the year.  So, yes, there is a number of days Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess, maybe for those who are not 
Hindu maybe to highlight the most ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   The most popular. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 130 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...well-known. 
MR SINGH:   The most well-known, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So apart from not mentioning...  
When I asked you about these, you said:  Well, the ones 
that come to mind is obviously the Diwali function. 
MR SINGH:   Well, when you asked, I answered generally. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, and you see, because I 
have been asking you about:  Do you not just invite your 
nearest and dearest to Diwali?  And you then suggested, 
10 
well, you did not go to Diwali at the Guptas but you did, 
correct? 
MR SINGH:   I am trying to recall, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You said – I asked what the 
functions it were?  You said:  Well, the functions that 
comes to mind is obviously the Diwali functions. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, you asked what were those religious – 
what were the religious functions and I said one of the 
obvious ones was Diwali.  I did not say I attended the 
Diwali function. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, is my learned 
friend referring to the transcripts, so that we can just have 
a look at the relevant pages. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 131 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ..let me read the full ...[intervenes]  
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   He does not need to read the 
full, he can just refer us ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I actually want to read the full 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe you must start by explaining 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is at page 2012 of the transcript of 
12  March 2021, Day 360. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, while ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So if I could just start, please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Mr Singh, oh some water.  
Will somebody please give Mr Singh some water?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what we – I was going to read 
from the foot of page 24. 
“Mr Myburgh:  And which members of the 
Gupta family would you interact with on these 
occasions that you attended the Saxonwold 
residence? 
20 
Mr Singh:  Mr Chair, religious functions were 
attended by a number of people and this is 
normally the case.  So I had occasion to meet 
Mr Athol Gupta, Mr Rajesh Gupta, Mr AJ Gupta 
as well. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 132 of 296 
 
Mr Myburgh:  Let me turn rather – perhaps I 
could 
just 
ask 
you. 
 These 
cultural 
and 
religious functions that you attended, did they 
typically after hours or on the weekends? 
Obviously, on any particular religious day. 
Mr Singh:  Well, the ones that come to mind is 
obviously the Diwali functions and the Diwali 
function were depending on when the occasion 
of Diwali would fall in the... [And so it goes 
on.] 
10 
Mr Myburgh:  Alright.  Did you have occasion 
to visit Sahara Computers?...” 
 
So that was the question around Diwali.  I just 
want to get it clear from you.  Did you go to the Guptas 
and celebrated Diwali with them, yes or no? 
MR SINGH:   Look, this is my response.  I do not recall 
going but maybe I did.  I do not recall. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And from your own perspective.  You 
have a sense that the Guptas invited those people close to 
them to these functions or did they adopt an all come 
20 
approach? 
MR SINGH:   I think Mr Chair, for the ones I attended, as I 
explained previously, there were a number of people that 
attended.  How and who and how they selected people to 
be invited, I would not know that. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 133 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And would my understanding be 
correct and please tell me if I am wrong.  If you celebrate 
Diwali and in this instance with the Guptas, then you are 
not celebrating it with your own people and family, is that 
right? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So in these instances when you went 
to the Guptas, you choice to go and celebrate Diwali with 
the Guptas instead of your own family, instead of those 
nearest and dearest to you. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Well, hence I am saying Mr Chair but I do not 
recall attending a Diwali function at the Guptas because 
my – as I have testified, in my case I celebrated with my 
nearest and closest family as opposed to doing it, you 
know, with let us say other people that I am not as close to 
as my immediate family.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your experience, generally 
speaking?  Is that when people celebrate Diwali, they 
celebrate them with family and those close to them or is it 
that they celebrate them with whoever comes in?  You 
20 
know, in my culture, for example, if there is a wedding or 
something and you have slaughtered a cow you do not 
issue invites 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know.  Even a strange who is 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 134 of 296 
 
walking passed, if they see that there is a wedding, there 
must be food, there must be meat.  They take a detour and 
they come into your house. 
MR SINGH:   [laughs; 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nobody asked them:  Who invited you?  
Who are you? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And the idea is, everyone who 
comes must be given food and if anybody leaves without 
being offered food, that is something very bad. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in that setup that I am talking about, 
anybody can come.  So with the Diwali, what is your 
experience?  Is it that people celebrate them with family 
and those who are close to them or is it that anybody that 
can come? 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair I think it depends.  Certainly in 
my case, it would be those closest to me, whether it is in 
the neighbourhood at the time because it is characterised 
by exchanging of you know eats and those type of things.  
20 
So wherever you are actually during that time you actually 
visit people as well.   
 
So if you have acquaintances, you probably go 
and exchange, you know, these eats with them.  They will 
come to you or you would go to them.  The neighbours 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 135 of 296 
 
would – if you had dinner, the neighbour may join you or 
you may join the neighbour because as you know that 
Diwali in the evening there is firework and stuff like that 
and then it becomes more of a communal type of thing with 
the kids and everybody else.  So that is probably what my 
experience is.   
 
But I am not too sure what the setup at the 
Guptas is for example because I do not think I could just 
pitch up there and just arrive and say I am here and I want 
to participate in the Diwali festivals, for example.  Because 
10 
they are, I would assume, you will have to – like I have 
been invited.  So I go when I am invited.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Since you did attend on your version 
various cultural events or functions at the Gupta residence.  
Do you know of any reason why you might have not 
attended Diwali? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, because of my preference to 
celebrate it with my closest as you would say family. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SINGH:   So it is a special day.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR SINGH:   So we dedicate it to the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  The other cultural events would 
not be events or to celebrate with family those closest to 
you. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 136 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Not necessarily Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, okay.   
MR SINGH:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Singh, just to follow on those 
questions.  What I just want to ask you is.  I do not follow 
you why the Gupta’s invited you to these events because it 
is your evidence and you must correct me if I am wrong, is 
that you never went to the Guptas, other than when you 
were invited to religious or cultural events.  You did not 
10 
interact with them at all. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What would have caused them then 
just to invite you?  You have nothing to do with them but 
when a religious or cultural event came up, you are on the 
guest list.  How did that happen? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, my learned friend 
might forget the evidence of the witness was that he did in 
fact meet them at the TNA breakfasts.  That is how he got 
to know them.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, I mean, equally so.  It could be 
asked why did the Guptas invite me to the wedding? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To what? 
MR SINGH:   You know, to the Sun City wedding, for 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 137 of 296 
 
example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR SINGH:   I do not know why he invites me to the Sun 
City wedding but I did not attend.  So I guess the same 
could be asked. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But did they invite you to the 
wedding? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, I thought they did not invite you 
to the wedding. 
10 
MR SINGH:   No, I said they did but I did not attend. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you, as you have said, you 
cannot explain why they would have invited you to the 
wedding? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you cannot really explain, 
correct me if I am wrong, why they invited you to these 
religious and cultural events? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, they are of Hindu descent.  I am of 
Hindu descent as I have explained before or just right 
20 
before.  I got to know them through the TNA breakfasts and 
that is how the relationship grew.  And you would normally 
invite people of similar culture to these religious events. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did you end up being close to them, 
the Guptas? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 138 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Well, Mr Chair I think we need to define 
close. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you – I think you did indicate about 
how many times you might have gone there. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
said 
about 
ten 
or 
eleven 
...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...or twelve times or whatever.  Over 
what period, do you remember? 
MR SINGH:   I think that was about over an three or four 
year period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About three or four year period which 
might mean you would have gone there on average about 
three times a year or so.  Well, that does not strike me as 
people that you are unfamiliar with.  Maybe that is the way 
to put it. 
MR SINGH:   I would agree, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you visit ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   Yes, I would visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...them for three times a year.  How far 
did you live from where they were?  How far were you? 
MR SINGH:   Ja, well, I guess from – I live in Wendywood 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 139 of 296 
 
Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And what kind of time in terms of 
distance ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   I would say it is probably not more than 20 – 
30-minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright.  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So You say that you Lift 
a marital home In about 2014.  You went to stay with 
Ms Naidoo.  She, we know - we will come to the dates in a 
moment, 
but 
in 
2015, 
She 
is 
employed 
at 
Sahara 
10 
Computers.  You have accepted that. So was that the time 
where through your relationship with her you started to 
interact more with the Guptas, You started to interact 
Mr Chawla.   
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you never go out to dinner for 
example with someone from Sahara Computers? 
MR SINGH:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And go along with Ms Nike? 
MR SINGH:   No, sir. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But perhaps I can just deal with that.  
you gave evidence and you did say dates were not your 
thing.  you see that she was employed there in 2013 or in 
2014 and that she left in 2015.  you see it a year and a 
half or two.  but from what we have been able to determine 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 140 of 296 
 
it seems that Ms Nike, in fact, commenced employment at 
Sahara on the 1st of January 2015 or at the beginning of 
January 2015. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, before the witness 
answers.  can my learned friend maybe she few relevant 
documentation with us that they obtained so that we can 
have a look at it ourselves?  It was not disclosed to us, it 
was not mailed to us.  We would like to have a look at it 
before he continues with this line of questioning. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am absolutely happy to do that if it 
10 
is in dispute.  I'm referring to her LinkedIn profile which 
was shown by one of the investigators yesterday.  I mean, I 
do not know if this is a big issue.  I mean, I am not 
suggesting - I am not trying to criticise you for not getting 
the dates spot on but I am - we can just deal with this 
issue.   
 
Does the date accord now with your recollection 
that she started there in January 2015?  what I have also 
seen and I can produce if you want is her resignation from 
Transnet.  She resigned, I think it was ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, the same situation 
goes, with respect, to the resignation.  We have not been 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You will get Ms Van den Heever, you will 
get it.  But Mr Myburgh can ask him in the meantime and 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 141 of 296 
 
Mr scene can answer what do nursing but he doesn't know.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, I...  Ja, I do not know 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the question.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I do not think that it needs to be 
contentious.  Let me tell you what I have seen and I am 
happy 
- 
of 
course 
I 
will 
provide 
you 
with 
the 
documentation.  what I was showing yesterday and my re 
collection is not necessarily - but I was shown a letter of 
resignation by Ms Nike from Transnet.   
10 
 
I 
think 
it 
was 
- 
she 
resigned 
on 
the 
3 r d  of November and she spoke about giving a months’ 
notice and I think she says in a letter that would expire on 
the 4 t h of December.  And I thought that is interesting 
because it wasn't a calendar months’ notice.  and then I 
was shown the LinkedIn profile which reflects... 
 
I am assuming it is still the current one oh it 
might be a historic one that reflects that she started at 
Sahara Computers – certainly - I am not sure if it said the 
1 s t of January but it said January 2015.  Do you want to 
20 
comment on that or you can say nothing until I show you 
the documents.  
MR SINGH:   No, no I - If it is a document then it is a 
document. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   does that accord go with your 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 142 of 296 
 
recollection? 
MR SINGH:   If it is documented then yes I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  And when did she leave 
because I suppose now I need to adjust things assuming 
that 
is 
correct, 
when 
did 
she 
then 
leave 
Sahara 
Computers?  Would that have been a year and a half two 
years from then?  
MR SINGH:   I would think probably around that time, yes.  
It would then be around 2017.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Around?  
10 
MR SINGH:   Around 2017, that would be.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, 2017.  So at the time that you 
worked for Eskom for example, she was then working at 
Sahara Computers?  
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And her boss at Sahara Computers, 
who was that?  
MR SINGH:   I think it would have been Mr Chawla. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   I think it would have been Mr Chawla. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   and did she work together with the 
Gupta brothers?  
MR SINGH:   I am assuming to the extent that she needed 
to.  I would assume so.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry you ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 143 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   I said to the extent that she would needed to.  
I would assume that you would have.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Singh, Just turning to a different 
topic.  I am informed that really at the outset of the 
Commission’s work, there was a time where you intended 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Commission 
and 
you 
in 
fact 
volunteered and affidavit which was shown to some 
investigators and I think some members of the Legal Team 
on a sort of a show and tell basis.  do you recall that?  
10 
MR SINGH:   Mr. Chair, this was subject to a confidential 
legal and privileged process that we have undertaken and 
I'm not too sure why this is being brought up now.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, what I want to find out is why 
did you withdraw your cooperation?  
MR SINGH:   It was again based on legal advice At the 
time which was legally privileged and we decided to 
discontinue the engagement with the Commission.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you still have that affidavit?  
MR SINGH:   No.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Oh, how can you say that with such 
certainty?  
MR SINGH:   Because I don't think we ever produced and 
affidavit.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  And who where your attorneys 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 144 of 296 
 
at the time?  
MR SINGH:   Thomson Wilks(?). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   Thomson Wilks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How did Ms Nike’s employment with 
Sahara come about? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, would this not be 
the kind of questions that should be directed at her?  With 
the greatest of respect, why must ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Van den Heever.  Mr Singh 
might know because there is a version that he had a 
relationship with the Guptas, a certain relationship with the 
Guptas.  Of course, he has a certain version.  But it is a 
legitimate question.  Do you know it happened Mr Singh? 
MR SINGH:   I think Mr Chair she had accompanied me to 
one of the functions and she had got chatting to the people 
that were there and she had expressed an interest in – her 
area of expertise was project management in IT.  So I 
guess that was the catalyst of that but further than that, 
20 
Mr Chair, I am not too sure.   
CHAIRPERSON:   She had accompanied you when you had 
gone ...[intervenes]  
MR SINGH:   On one of the occasions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   On one of the occasions? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 145 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And there she had spoken 
to one of the Gupta people? 
MR SINGH:   I would assume so Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  I want to move now to a 
different topic and that relates to your FNB salary account.  
Could you please go to Bundle 5(c), page 1568? 
MR SINGH:   15... 
CHAIRPERSON:   1568, Mr Myburgh? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   1568.  Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, maybe this is an 
opportune moment before my learned friend starts with this 
line of questions.  I did approach him this morning 
pertaining to this particular issue and maybe this argument 
should be dealt with in camera because it relates to an 
issue that we say is an infringement of our client’s right to 
privacy under the Constitution and there is a number of 
issues we would like to raise in that regard.  I was hoping 
20 
that I could sort this out with my learned friend inter partes 
but seemingly he has decided to go ahead and I would like 
to be offer the opportunity to make certain submissions to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to apply for the evidence 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 146 of 296 
 
relating to his bank accounts to be held in camera? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   No, Chairperson.  I want to 
make certain submissions to you but because of the 
content of what my learned friend is to put, I think that 
should be in camera.  We are objecting to him being 
questioned on his private bank account details.  We – I 
have told my learned friend this morning already.  I object 
to it be included in the bundles.   
 
He was never informed of the fact that his bank 
records are being subpoenaed.  I do not believe there is a 
10 
lawful basis for it be subpoenaed.  There is no allegations 
that there was anything corrupt, untoward pertaining to 
these bank statements.  And for the investigators or 
whoever to have subpoenaed this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay do not make your submissions 
now.  We are going to take an adjournment at four as we 
normally do.  Maybe should take it now a ten minutes 
adjournment and then when I come back I will hear what 
you have to say and I will hear what Mr Myburgh has to 
say.  We adjourn. 
20 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...proposed to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe you can just adjust your mic, it 
seems to – ja. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 147 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  I have proposed to my learned 
friend that one way of eventually resolving this issue is 
that one might remove the bank accounts or statements 
and then just deal with the matter on the basis of Fundudzi 
report, Mr Benjamin’s affidavit and an Excel spreadsheet 
that is attached.  I understand that that is not acceptable 
to them.  So it does not seem that we can resolve this 
impasse and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if the impasse is not resolved, if I 
am asked to make a ruling, I will make a ruling.  The 
10 
Commission is involved in an investigation of great public 
interest where there are allegations of corruption, there 
are allegations of certain people having given certain 
people money, sometimes large amounts of money in order 
to do wrong things and there is taxpayers’ money involved, 
so if I have to make a ruling, I will make a ruling.  I accept 
that there can be issues of privacy and so on but if I have 
to listen to argument I will hear argument and make a 
ruling but we cannot spend too much time and not 
proceeding with the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
20 
 
Obviously things can be sorted out that is relevant, 
sometimes things cannot be sorted out and when you are 
involved in something that involves public interest and 
public money, not every solution is - you know, a solution 
has got to be based also on an appreciation that are not 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 148 of 296 
 
just issues of privacy they are also issues of public 
interest. 
 
So if you are happy to deal with the matter in the 
way you say you were proposing to them, at least for now 
maybe while there is a reflection on the issue of bank 
statements then we could do that but it may well be at the 
end that the issue that needs to be confronted might have 
to be confronted but it may well be that it will not be 
necessary to confront it.   
 
So but if they have an objection to you even 
10 
dealing with it in this way, you might have to see whether 
you – I should make a ruling whether you can deal with it 
in that way for now without necessarily making a ruling on 
whether you cannot use the first approach you intended to 
use, so – but I do not know what you propose to 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, perhaps I should hear from my 
learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   She seems to have an overall 
20 
objection. 
 
I 
hope 
I 
am 
characterising 
the 
position 
correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And want to see the subpoenas 
before she decides what her client should do.  Just to 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 149 of 296 
 
place that on record, DCJ.  The investigators are here, 
they have made requests for these subpoenas.  We are 
waiting to hear when we will be able to produce them by – I 
am told that these were amongst the very early subpoenas 
in the Commission, so they need to be dug up, but we are 
hopeful that that could certainly be done overnight.  I am 
sure it could. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Ms van den Heever? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, thank you.  Our 
approach is a very simple approach, we do have certain 
10 
rights under the Constitution and I understand what you 
say, Chairperson, there is some public …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Interest. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Interest that is at play but public 
interest must be weighed up against your right to privacy.  
What I propose to my learned friend – and I do have an 
objection to him going to only the conclusions and Mr 
Benjamin’s affidavit because what is contained in their flow 
directly from the bank statements, I said to him we wish to 
see all the bank statements, the subpoenas that is here, I 
20 
want to understand the basis on which subpoenas were 
applied for obtained and what exactly was subpoenaed.  
We still have a recourse, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   To, for instance, take a review 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 150 of 296 
 
process pertaining to this particular issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But I can – once we have had 
the subpoenas, we are sensible people and we have had a 
look at it, then we can possibly advise our client in our 
different direction but for us to sit here and just go ahead 
nilly 
willy 
without 
properly 
being 
appraised 
of 
what 
happened, having had the opportunity to properly consult 
on those with the client and taking a proper instruction is 
not fair to the client and it is at this stage I would submit is 
10 
highly prejudicial to him especially when it would have 
been a simple exercise to inform him on the fact that those 
subpoenas were issued so that he at that stage already 
when this happened could have exercised any rights that 
he had.   
 
So we say – and we respectfully submit that we be 
given an opportunity to look at the subpoenas and make an 
informed decision and until that stage to force him to deal 
with something that flows from the bank statements that we 
say we have not even seen the subpoenas would be highly 
20 
prejudicial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The bank statements, he has seen those 
I assume for some time. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   He has not seen them for some 
time, we recently got to know of them, Chairperson. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 151 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But that is not the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   The issue is not an isolated set 
of bank statements that they want to present or present 
evidence on, it is about the conspectus of what – and I do 
not want to put – to argue or to try and make submissions 
on behalf, we know what the position is here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   But we have a right to also deal 
10 
with issues in a correct and proper manner protecting our 
own interest and our rights as afforded in …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, tell me, let us assume – what would 
be the best scenario for you when you see subpoenas? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I would like to see 
the subpoenas.  I need to understand the basis for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to see whether the bank 
statements were obtained legally, is that correct? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, it does not even go 
to that.  I am entitled to see the subpoenas, I can only 
20 
make …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may be entitled but I want to see 
what the connection is between seeing the subpoenas and 
the evidence not proceeding despite the fact that you have 
seen the bank statements.  That is the connection that I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 152 of 296 
 
want to understand. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, I would like the 
opportunity  to see them and then make submissions to 
you.  I cannot make submissions to you as to where I will 
go with it without seeing the statements.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, if you do not - if you cannot 
enlighten me on that I remain in a position where I do not 
see the connection, you see?  Whereas what I am trying to 
see is whether you have a case for me to say Mr Myburgh 
should not lead that evidence until you have seen the 
10 
subpoenas but if I do not see the connection, I cannot 
assist you.  So that is why I was asking what is the 
connection? 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, my understanding 
is  that the Commission has a while ago already issues 
subpoenas in respect of various bank statements.  They 
now wish to elevate one of the bank statements to a 
certain position.  I need to see the other bank statements 
that were subpoenaed because you cannot expect of my 
client to answer questions in isolation, number one. 
20 
 
Number two, I need to ensure that the subpoenas 
were done properly, they were in respect of certain time 
periods, in respect of certain bank accounts with certain 
fundamental underlying reasons to subpoena them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, basically it is two things you 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 153 of 296 
 
say.  One, to the extent that there may be other bank 
statements you would like to see them. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   I would like to see the 
subpoenas, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well I am saying too. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   And then the bank statements if 
they were obtained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so you want to see the subpoenas in 
order to see what they covered and whether they were 
legal, you know?   And two, you want to see other bank 
10 
statements to the extent that there may be other bank 
statements. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, may I just take an 
instruction from my attorney before we…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh, what do you want to say? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Chairperson, I am not sure that I 
have much to say, I mean, other than – I am not sure that I 
understand the argument, to be frank, because if what my 
20 
learned friend at best for her it seems is going to try and 
suppress this evidence because these subpoenas at best 
were somehow irregular and that presumably is the best of 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but if they were irregular I am sure 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 154 of 296 
 
the discretion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that is the one thing.  The 
other thing is, is it does not do away with the Fundudzi 
report, 
Fundudzi 
report 
is 
a 
public 
report, 
it 
says 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and it has not been set aside. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It has not been set aside, they had 
the bank accounts, they analysed them and they actually 
asked Mr Singh for his input. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he said that all of the amounts 
in that account came from - in relation to Transnet or 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, I mean, what we did was to 
double check Fundudzi’s work and yes, we have produced 
more detail but I cannot see where this takes us to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the one thing we can explore – I 
think there are two options.  I do not see my way to saying 
let us stop.  I think there are two options.  One option is 
20 
whether you are able to deal with other issues for the rest 
of the time that we have for today and then tomorrow 
hopefully there would be no issues anymore because 
maybe whatever subpoenas there are would have been 
looked at and there would be no problem.  That is one 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 155 of 296 
 
option. 
 
But if the position is that we either deal with this 
or lose the time, then there is the difficulty but to the 
extent that the matters are already in the Fundudzi report, 
which has not been set aside, I would be inclined to say 
that that could be dealt with.   
 
So what is the position, is it possible for us to use 
the time we have on issues other than this? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it not possible? 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Of course it is possible, DCJ, to 
move – to change gears and to deal with something else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We can then hopefully get the 
subpoenas overnight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   My learned friend can then make a 
call on this tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, I think let us do it that way 
then. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So understand there is another 
witness at five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I can certainly, of course, deal 
with something – try and deal with something discreetly in 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 156 of 296 
 
that half an hour if that is what you have in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, let us do that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I want now to turn – I will come back 
to the salary account one way or the other tomorrow.  I 
want to turn to discuss with you two things that you have 
dealt with in your affidavit and that is, what seems to be a 
kind of an important overall context in relation to the 
various acts of procurement that we are going to be 
10 
examining in the balance of your evidence. 
 
So I want to start off by dealing with the market 
demand strategy, the so-called MDS.  I understood from 
one of your affidavits that you were actually involved in the 
development of this strategy, is that correct? 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what was the role that you 
played in that? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, at the time I occupied the position 
of the Acting CFO of Transnet. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The position of? 
MR SINGH:   Acting CFO of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SINGH:   And …[intervenes] 
ADV VAN DEN HEEVER:   Chairperson, my client my speak 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 157 of 296 
 
into the mic, we cannot hear this side.  Please. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, the affidavit that we are 
referring to, do you know which one it is? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If you want to go there you go there 
but I want just to deal with in a general way. 
MR SINGH:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And to actually find out from you 
precisely what the MDS entailed and how significant it was, 
not into your job but to the work really of Transnet at this 
10 
time. 
MR SINGH:   Okay.  I think, Mr Chair, as I was explaining, 
at the time I was the Acting Group Chief Financial Officer 
of Transnet and one of the functions that I had at the time 
was like we spent an inordinate amount of time discussing 
the corporate plan on the Eskom side, a big chunk of my 
time was also taken up preparing the corporate plan for 
Transnet and at the time there was also a change of the 
board, so a new board had taken over at the time.  I think 
that coincided with Minister Gigaba taking over as Minister 
20 
of Public Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do not lower your voice. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Sir, let me get this closer.  So that 
should be better. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not what the technicians had done 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 158 of 296 
 
yesterday, I do not know whether afternoon everybody was 
speaking very loud, I think the mics had been adjusted so 
at least maybe they should adjust yours. 
MR SINGH:   Well maybe, Mr Chair, it is just because of 
the way I sit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, well they are hearing, if they 
are able to adjust remotely where they are then we can 
hear you because you lower your voice.  Okay, alright, just 
continue. 
MR SINGH:   So, Mr Chair, there was some how can I say, 
10 
criticism from the new board relating to Transnet’s ability 
to unlock the value in the economy vis-à-vis the fact that 
the logistics chain plays a very critical – is a very critical 
component of actually enabling economic growth. 
 
To 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
rail 
system 
is 
fully 
capacitated or it does not have excess capacity to the 
extent that the ports do not excess capacity, to the extent 
the pipelines do not have excess capacity, your economy is 
constrained and our economy, being and export-driven 
economy to the extent that the world economy is let us say 
20 
enjoying a boom, the South African economy is constrained 
by the capacity that the logistics system actually has so 
that was one of the bottlenecks that the board had actually 
identified in that Transnet was basically a bottleneck to 
economic growth. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 159 of 296 
 
 
So 
in 
responding 
to 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
corporate plan, Mr Chair, we decided to understand to what 
extent if we were to enable the economy and un-bottleneck 
the constraints that were perceived to be there from a 
capacity perspective in the rail and the port and the 
pipeline business, what would be – what would Transnet 
look like and, Mr Chair, that basically evolved into what we 
now call the market demand, Chair. 
 
So basically, instead of constraining or instead of 
planning to what we called at the time contracted demand, 
10 
we planned now to market demand.  So if there was market 
demand for 100 million tons of rail asset, whether we had a 
contract for it or not, we were planning to actually put the 
capacity in place on the basis that it would have been 
taken up.  Okay? 
 
So that was the difference between let us say the 
historic planning scenario and the new planning scenario 
which was out of the market demand strategy. 
 
Mr Chair, one of the reasons why the board was 
critical of the planning scenarios and why we were a 
20 
bottleneck to the economy is that they felt that the country 
actually missed out an opportunity in terms of participating 
in the commodity boom that preceded the financial crisis 
and the commodity slump.   
 
So from that perspective, Mr Chair, we then said 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 160 of 296 
 
okay, let us unconstrain the planning parameters and see 
what comes out of it and basically, Mr Chair, that then led 
to the development of the market demand strategy, the 
market demand strategy was counter-cyclical interview 
strategy so it actually invested ahead of demand so it 
would perceive demand to peak in three years from now.  
The investment decision for that commodity to peak in 
three years had to happen now because there was a lead 
time in terms of being able to actually plan and execute the 
projects that are required to make sure the demand 
10 
actually happens.  So that was the explanation of counter- 
cyclical investment strategy.   
 
The plan was premised on a R300 billion capital 
spend, Mr Chair, and that was for the whole of Transnet 
being Transnet Freight Rail, which is the rail entity, 
Transnet National Ports Authority, Transnet Port Terminals 
and Transnet Pipeline as well as Transnet Engineering and 
the biggest chunk of the spend, Mr Chair, was allocated to 
Rail and the biggest chunk of the Rail investment was 
allocated to locomotives. 
20 
 
In the Ports business the biggest chunk of the 
capital was allocated to the – if I recall correctly, the 
widening and deepening of the harbours on the Transnet 
National Ports Authority side. 
 
On the Transnet Port Terminal side it was related 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 161 of 296 
 
to container stacking areas, maintenance of container 
stacking areas, improving efficiencies in the ports and 
certain crane acquisitions as well. 
 
On the Transnet Pipeline side it was continuing 
with 
the 
new 
multiproduct 
pipeline 
which 
is 
the 
Johannesburg to Durban petroleum pipeline but obviously 
transports petroleum products from the coast to England. 
 
Mr Chair, that was also linked to a – I think it was 
R110 or R120 billion funding programme over the five year 
period.   
10 
 
So, Mr Chair in a nutshell, that was the market 
demand strategy in terms of how it impacted Transnet and 
how it impacted let us say the broader economy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to follow up.  In your 
affidavit – actually you can go there if you would like, this 
is at bundle 5B, page 472, paragraph 15. 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, page number 472? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   472. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say at paragraph 15, under the 
heading Market Demand Strategy: 
“I confirm that the planning and development of the 
market demand strategy, MDS, was the initiative 
and work product of myself and the corporate 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 162 of 296 
 
finance department of Transnet.” 
Do you confirm that? 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then you spoke about 300 billion 
capital expenditure and chunks of it.  What chunk of that 
300 billion was allocated to Freight Rail? 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall offhand right now but I will 
probably say probably half of it or more than half of it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And of that half that was allocated to 
Freight 
Rail, 
what 
chunk 
of 
that 
was 
allocated 
to 
10 
locomotives? 
MR SINGH:   I would think probably 60 to 70 billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR SINGH:   60 to 70 billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So would have been about… 
MR SINGH:   Half of the half. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Half of the half.  So …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   35%. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If a 150 billion was allocated to 
Freight Rail, about half of that was allocated to Freight 
20 
Rail, about half of that was allocated to locomotives. 
MR SINGH:   If I recall correctly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  And …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   Sorry, Mr Chair, if we – before we move off 
paragraph 15, I think you did give some context in terms of 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 163 of 296 
 
the wording of paragraph 15.  The context of this first 
paragraph 
relates 
to 
the 
conceptual 
thinking 
and 
conceptual work, so it was initial planning that this refers 
to 
because 
the 
corporate 
planning 
process, 
as 
we 
understand is a very different complex and detailed 
process. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And from the evidence that has been 
given before the MDS was announced in April 2011 the 
investment itself commenced a year later in April 2012.  
Does that accord with your recollection? 
10 
MR SINGH:   It probably will, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   By the ti8me that you were then 
seconded from Transnet to Eskom one was about three 
years into the MDS. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And I take it that the MDS, speaking 
broadly, would probably have been your most important 
task or function in those years. 
MR SINGH:   Well, executing the corporate plan would 
have been, whatever was contained therein would have 
20 
been, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  I want then to talk a little bit 
about the BADC and delegations of authority.  Now Mr 
Forman gave evidence about this, I just want to see to 
what extent you might agree.  Historically his evidence was 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 164 of 296 
 
that historically the board, including subcommittees, did 
not have any delegation of authority when it came to 
procurement-related 
matters, 
there 
had 
been 
a 
decentralised 
procurement 
system 
in 
place. 
 
As 
I 
understand, that is at an operational level, a divisional 
level.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would hazard to say that I do not 
recall in terms of – which period are you talking about 
specifically? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, before 2011. 
10 
MR SINGH:   Before 2011.  There were acquisition councils 
at a group level as well, if I recall correctly. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then …[intervenes] 
MR SINGH:   I am not too sure what the board levels were. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  What he testified to is that 
in 2011 the board then acquired these procurement powers 
and a special subcommittee of the board was created, that 
being BADC.  That I think you deal with in your affidavit. 
MR SINGH:   Yes, Mr Chair, that I confirm that yes, the 
BADC was a product of the board. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So a subcommittee of the board. 
MR SINGH:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you sit on the BADC? 
MR SINGH:   No, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 165 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:   I was not a member of the BADC. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And perhaps you could just help us 
understand the composition of obviously an important body 
within Transnet.  What was the makeup of the BADC?  
What sort of qualities where the board looking for because 
some of the board members sat on the BADC.  What 
qualities qualified one to be a BADC member? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I would be speculating if I gave a 
response because the – I will be corrected, I may be 
mistaken, but I think the composition of - let us leave own 
10 
the BADC but the composition of any of the board 
subcommittees I think took place in a committee called the 
Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and 
that committee would sit and decide, you know, based on 
the PO’s mix of the board which members would be 
suitable in which committees.  As far as I recall, that is 
how it happened. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then the evidence was 
that the BADC’s approval authority was increased in 2012 
to tenders up to 2 billion with the board being required to 
20 
approve tenders above that.  Does that accord with your 
recollection? 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, the delegations would have been a 
function of a delegation of a party framework, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  And then what we know as well 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 166 of 296 
 
is that Mr Sharma was appointed as the Chair of the BADC 
in August of 2012. 
MR SINGH:   Mr Chair, I am not exactly sure of the date 
but I am aware that Mr Sharma was the Chairman of the 
BADC. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And for how long did he serve as the 
Chairperson of the BADC? 
MR SINGH:   I do not recall, Mr Chair. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Would it have been for a number of 
years? 
10 
MR SINGH:   I would think so, Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we do know when we come to 
the locomotives I think in ‘13/’14 he was the Chair of the 
BADC. 
MR SINGH:   That is correct Sir. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now did you know Mr Sharma?   
MR SINGH:  Prior to his non-executive role as a director, 
no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  But you came to know Mr Sharma in 
his role as a director? 
20 
MR SINGH:  That is, yes that is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And to what extent would you interact 
with him? 
MR SINGH:  At board meetings or BBC meetings or if there 
were any other board strategy sessions, that was it.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 167 of 296 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Did you know of any relationship 
between Mr Sharma and Mr Essa? 
MR SINGH:  No sir.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Okay, then the evidence has been 
that in 2013 the DOA added bid adjudication to BADC 
powers and delegated authority to certain individuals to 
prove how value transactions, yourself and the GCE. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct sir, but not only us.  I mean 
other executives also had powers.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja, your approvals authority in 2013 
10 
as I have it was 750 million and the GCE’s was up to a 
billion. 
MR SINGH:  You will have to be a bit more specific 
because if you look at the delegation of authority frame 
work. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes. 
MR SINGH:  There are a number of sub categories within 
the delegation and each of them have different values.  So 
if you are referring to capital it would be a number.  The 
problem with capital it would be a number, unapproved 
20 
capital would be a different number for example.   
 
Funding would be a different number for example.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Well, let me then ask you.  When I 
asked you that your approval authority was up to 750 
million, which of those things did that relate to? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 168 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  I think Mr Chair, we did attach the delegation 
of authority frame work in one of our affidavits.  Maybe if 
we can quickly go to that.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Singh, the actual number is not 
important to me.  I mean the point that I make is that in 
2013 specific individuals were then given authority to 
conclude how value transactions, that number ... you had a 
certain number, presumably the GEC had a higher number.  
 
Is that right? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So what I have read in the evidence 
and what has been referred to is that to an extent you kind 
of became a one person acquisition counsel through this 
authority.  You want to comment on that?  You do not 
agree?   
MR SINGH:  No, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  In 2016 BADC approval authority had 
now been increased to three billion, the board retained 
authority for tenders above this.  Would you confirm that?  
We know that you left in 2015, in the middle of 2015. 
20 
MR SINGH:  Yes, when was the increase? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  I talked about 2016. 
MR SINGH:  Ja, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Both BADC, yourself and the 
GCE had the powers to award tenders on confinement.  Is 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 169 of 296 
 
that correct? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, the confinement delegation of 
authority was changed at the request of the BADC at some 
point in time where the confinement delegation was 
removed from all group, well from all officials other than 
the GCE and the BVC and the board.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Alright.  Now Mr Frolick in his 
evidence testified that his so called one person acquisition 
counsel and the wide spread use of the confinement 
process were amongst the areas of concern.  Problem 
10 
areas that he identified which the new PPM, procurement 
procedures manual, seeks to address. 
 
You want to comment on that? 
MR SINGH:  Yes.  Mr Frolick was the, how can I call it?  
The procurement governance guy at Transnet and at the 
request of actually the board he undertook an exercise to 
understand 
how 
the 
procurement 
environment 
within 
Transnet can actually be strengthened and one of the 
recommendations was that the confinement process was 
being flouted.  
20 
 
I am not too sure when exactly he did the exercise, 
but I think that was one of the issues that he led the board 
to remove the delegation from all executives other than the 
group chief executive and the BBC and the board.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So I mean, I presume that the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 170 of 296 
 
confinement process is open to abuse by unscrupulous 
individuals potentially. 
MR SINGH:  I guess it is open to interpretation because 
like with every procedure there is, or every policy there is 
a procedure and the procedure is open to interpretation in 
terms of are you applying. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Now I want to turn to the 1064 
locomotives and the big picture as I call it.  I mean it really 
lies very much at the heart of my examination of you and I 
want to start off by dealing with the transaction advisors, 
10 
but before that I want to just explore this, the big picture.  
 
I want to start out by just discussing your role and 
perhaps the easiest way is just for me to put to you what I 
think it was and then you can tell me if I am right or wrong.  
It seems that you played from what I can see a central role 
in the appointment of the transaction advisors in the 
formulation of the business case, in the tender evaluation 
and negotiation process, in the conclusion of the LSA’s 
with the four OEM’s, in the approval of the increase in the 
ETC and then in the funding arrangements, the 50 billion 
20 
rand funding arrangement that was put in place.  
 
Would that be an accurate summary of your various 
roles and interactions? 
MR SINGH:  Sorry, if I could just repeat those.  You 
basically say the central role in the appointment of the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 171 of 296 
 
transaction advisors. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  Formulation of the business case, right? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  Tender valuation and negotiation 
process.   
MR SINGH:  Tender evaluation and negotiation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Conclusion of the LSA’s with the four 
OEM’s which then flows from that, the approval of the 
increase in the ETC and the 50 billion rand funding 
arrangements that were put in place.   
10 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, if I can respond.  In terms of the 
central role on the transaction advisors, Mr Chair the 
transaction advisors, I was the business requester for the 
transaction advisors.  So from that perspective, I would be 
receiving their service.  
 
So from that perspective I would need to, I would 
have needed to be engaged from time to time in terms of 
what was happening on that procurement event.  If I cannot 
say I played a central role Mr Chair, because I was not the 
people that sat and evaluated the tenders for example.  
20 
 
I did not choose a successful tender, but did I deal 
with matters that emanated from, that flowed there from, 
yes I dealt with issues that flowed from that process.  
Formulation of the business case Mr Chair, the business 
case was always owned by or business cases are always 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 172 of 296 
 
owned by the asset owner.  
 
The asset owner in this case was Transnet Freight 
Rail.  So Transnet Freight Rail basically owned the 
business.  Because of the size of the procurement event, 
at that stage when the business case was developed was 
38 billion. 
 
It needed to have board approval and obviously 
ministerial ... now in those cases group of where we sat at 
group at the time took an interest in those type of business 
cases, from the time they were incepted so that when it 
10 
gets to group and to the board, you do not have a disparity 
between business case that is used that is not of quality or 
that have missed a whole lot of, how can I call it?   
 
Issues that needed to have been dealt with.  So 
yes, in terms of my role as the CFO, I was involved in the 
business 
case 
and 
the 
formulation 
thereof. 
 
Tender 
evaluation and negotiation Mr Chair.  Tender evaluation I 
was not part of.  I was not part of the tender evaluation 
teams, of the functional teams that were put together to 
evaluate the tenders.  
20 
 
So if you had to ask me did I see a tender 
document, Mr Chair no I did not.  Did I evaluate a tender 
document, no I did not.  So from that perspective the 
tender evaluation process was undertaken by the cross 
function evaluation teams and they produced [indistinct].  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 173 of 296 
 
 
I think Mr Chair, in our roles, the output of those 
tender evaluation teams, would have probably come across 
Mr Gama’s desk, my desk and Mr Molefe’s desk which then 
would have went through to the board and the BADC 
accordingly.  
 
So that is the role in terms of the evaluations.  In 
terms of the negotiations Mr Chair, and I would take the 
negotiations and the conclusion of the LSN, put them 
together because they basically negotiations was the input 
and the output was the LSA or the locomotive supply 
10 
agreement.  
 
So Mr Chair, yes there I did play an intimate role in 
the 
negotiation 
or 
the, 
let 
us 
call 
it 
post 
tender 
negotiations.  That will probably be the more technical term 
and the conclusion of the LSA.  In terms of the interest in 
ETC Mr Chair, critical role.  
 
I do not know it is up for interpretation but again 
the increase in ETC Mr Chair, is an output of the 
negotiation and LSA process and locomotive supplier 
process and the [indistinct] of this management, this risk 
20 
management framework and the delegation of authority.  
 
In terms of, Mr Chair again the increase in ETC, 
because it is a capital equipment purchase, the increase in 
ETC would normally have to go through the, again the 
capital organisation within the business unit, the capital 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 174 of 296 
 
organisation 
in 
the 
group, 
go 
through 
the 
approval 
structures of the capital investment committee at group 
level and then obviously follow its way through to the 
board and if need be the minister.  
 
So from that perspective again it was like function 
as CFO to oversee the capital approval process as well.  In 
terms of the funding arrangement Mr Chair, one of the core 
functions of the CFO function is the funding and obviously, 
as I said the 300 billion rand capital plan came I think with 
a hundred or 125 billion rand [indistinct] over the five year  
10 
period.  
 
So the funding arrangements relating to the loco’s 
would yes, be part of my functions and yes it would have 
occupied a good part of my time.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So from what we have seen, you 
were a member of the locomotive steering committee.  Is 
that correct? 
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, this committee was envisaged but it 
actually never existed or was never, how can I say 
constituted.  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then there is also a reference in 
evidence, and we can come back to who was supposed to 
sit on it and who was not.  There has also been reference 
to a subcommittee of the locomotive steering committee.  
Was that something also that did not get off the ground, or 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 175 of 296 
 
was there a subcommittee and the evidence there I think 
reference has been made to you, Mr Gama and Mr Singh.  
 
Was there a subcommittee? 
MR SINGH:  Mr, Mr Gama and? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry and Mr Molefe.  
MR SINGH:  Oh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  Okay.  So I think that again it was not a formal 
subcommittee.  Once the board had made the decision to 
short list and given us the decision to negotiate, they 
10 
delegated to Mr Molefe the authority to negotiate but not 
conclude.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Sorry, will you not just repeat that, I 
did not hear you? 
MR SINGH:  I said once the board had taken the decision 
to short list the four successful tenderers, they had 
delegated the authority to Mr Molefe as the GCE to 
negotiate ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  
MR SINGH:  With the suppliers, the four short list 
20 
suppliers, but not conclude the contract.  So Mr Molefe in 
turn requested that Mr Gama and myself engage with this 
negotiation process and provide feedback to him on a daily 
basis, so I had a basis as we required to do so.  
 
So again, it was not a formal steering committee, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 176 of 296 
 
but that is how it came about.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  We have got I think two minutes or so 
left.  Could I just take you, whilst we are on that.  Perhaps 
we can just finalise that discreet topic.  Could you please 
turn to page 1520? 
MR SINGH:  Of the same bundle? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes.  Sorry, this is in 5C.  Are you in 
5C?   
MR SINGH:  1520?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:  1520, ja.  I think this is what you are 
10 
dealing with at the foot of that page, at paragraph 57.   
MR SINGH:  Yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  So you say the board of directors 
delegated authority to finalise the negotiation process of 
the short listed bidders of the GCE. 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Do I understand you to have said that 
the delegation was to finalise, but not to conclude? 
MR SINGH:  That, if I am correct in my recollection. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then you go on to explain that 
20 
the GCE then requested the board, Gama and yourself to 
conduct the day to day engagements and negotiations with 
the shortlisted bidders, the OEM’s and this is post tender 
negotiations as I think you termed it.  
 
Is that correct? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 177 of 296 
 
MR SINGH:  Yes, when the short listing was done.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And then at 59: 
 
“Part  of this negotiation process was a full 
complement 
of 
Transnet 
Employees 
which 
included the TRF team, Transnet engineering 
team, Danie Smith, Lehur and the financial 
negotiation team and of course myself, Gama 
and or Giyane if Gama was unavailable.” 
 
You go on to say: 
 
“Giyane was the procurement subject matter 
10 
expert 
and 
acted 
as 
Gama’s 
designated 
representative when Gama could not attend 
the negotiation sessions.  From time to time I 
also provided an update to Gama and Brian 
Molefe 
of 
what 
transpired 
during 
these 
sessions, particularly pertaining to material 
issues, such as the decisions taken, etcetera.” 
 
You confirm that? 
MR SINGH:  That is correct.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Then would it be fair to say that you 
20 
were the chief negotiator?   
MR SINGH:  Mr Chair, I do not think that would be accurate 
as we did not have any decision making powers, both Mr 
Gama and myself.  The delegated authority was Mr Molefe, 
so he had the authority resting with him.  In terms of the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 178 of 296 
 
interactions with the four OEM’s, in terms of the amount of 
time spent, yes I spent the most of time with them.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Ja.  
MR SINGH:  In terms of the way that the interaction 
between Mr Gama and myself was undertaken, I dealt with 
more the financial issues and the financial consequences 
thereof and Mr Gama dealt with the more [indistinct] issues 
and the consequences of the locomotives arriving, but 
because he was the asset owner, my decisions I had to run 
by him because at the end of the day he was paid for that, 
10 
if you understand and then ultimately if we then agreed, we 
would then feedback those decisions and those issues 
back to Mr Molefe.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Chairperson, I finished this topic.  I 
am happy to go on if you want me to but I see it is five 
o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have seen the evidence leader 
come in, but I do not know if the witness is ...[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, he is over there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Yes, he is here.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He is here.  Ja, I think maybe let us 
adjourn so that I can resume after some minutes and then I 
deal with the Denel work stream.  So tomorrow we will, let 
us work on the basis that we will start at ten, but there is a 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 179 of 296 
 
possibility that I might want us to start at half past ten, 
which may well be most welcome to all of you if there are 
issues to be scratched out tomorrow morning.  
 
But if it is going to be half past ten instead of ten I 
will let Mr Myburgh know and then he will let everybody 
know.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so we will then adjourn the day 
session for today.  We adjourn.

22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 181 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  Good evening Advocate Kennedy.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Brown as the learned Chair has 
already indicated you assisted the Chair in the proceedings 
of the Commission previously in relation to some of the 
other entities. This evening my questions will be focused 
specifically on Denel, which was also a State owned 
corporation under the Public Enterprises Ministry when you 
held the position as Minister, is that correct? 
MS BROWN:   You’re right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Ms Brown is it correct that you 
10 
have been provided with a number of documents for 
purposes of this evening’s hearing? 
MS BROWN:   Are these the documents Exhibit W27 
onwards? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That’s correct. 
MS BROWN:   Yes I have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is it correct that the version that 
you have similar to ours has page numbers both on the top 
left and the top right? 
MS BROWN:   I am on a – I have them on a computer so 
20 
yes I have numbers on the left and right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay now for purposes of the 
questioning we are going to focus simply on the top left, so 
you can ignore the top right numbers. 
MS BROWN:   Yes, but you will have to give me the page 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 182 of 296 
 
Advocate. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes indeed.   
MS BROWN:   Because ja, so that I can add a page into 
the computer. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fine, so I am going to start with an 
affidavit that you signed and you will find that – if we look 
at the top left hand page numbers, Denel12-703, I am only 
going to use the last digits of the number for convenience, 
but can you look out for the affidavit where it starts at page 
703, it is your second supplementary affidavit. 
10 
MS BROWN:   703, you just have to give me one moment, I 
have my second supplementary affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have it marked 703? 
MS BROWN:   Yes, yes I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can ask you then to turn 
ahead to page 736, sorry 735 where it appears that your 
signature was made. 
MS BROWN:   I have that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you have that?  Do you confirm 
that this document is your affidavit that you signed before 
20 
a Commissioner of Oaths, it is referred to as your second 
supplementary affidavit. 
MS BROWN:   Yes, I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  I believe this affidavit 
may have already been introduced in another stream of 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 183 of 296 
 
evidence Chair, but for the record just to avoid any 
possible doubt in that regard may I then just ask the 
witness to confirm the contents of the affidavit and then I 
will ask for it to be admitted as evidence in this stream.   
Ms Brown ...[indistinct]  
MS BROWN:   I confirm that it is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That the contents are correct 
factually. 
MS BROWN:   Factually correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right thank you very much.   Chair 
10 
may we then ask for this document together with its 
annexures to be admitted.  We have taken the liberty of 
including this as Exhibit W27 in Denel bundle 12, and we 
would ask for its formal admission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say as Exhibit 27? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   W27. 
CHAIRPERSON:   W27.  The second supplementary 
affidavit of Ms Lynette Brown starting at page 703 is 
admitted as an exhibit and will be marked as Exhibit W27. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.   Now Ms Brown it 
20 
appears from your affidavit that you deal with a number of 
SU’s relating particularly to the appointment of boards of 
directors to various State owned entities, correct? 
MS BROWN:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We as I have indicated are going to 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 184 of 296 
 
focus this evening only on the Denel Board appointments 
and is it correct that you were provided with a copy of what 
has been referred to as the Fundudzi report, you in fact 
refer to that in your affidavit. 
MS BROWN:   Yes, I have been provided with Fundudzi 
report by the Commission. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and you were then given an 
opportunity to comment on the Fundudzi report where it 
raised various facts or comments or views in relation to our 
role and the role of people such as your PA in the process 
10 
leading up to the appointment of the various Boards, is 
that right? 
MS BROWN:   That’s right.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we are going to look particularly 
at the comments that you raised in relation to the Denel 
Board as I have indicated.   May I take you in your – I am 
sorry may I just indicate for the record Chair that the 
Fundudzi report has already been introduced into evidence 
in previous hearings by this Commission.   
 
May I take you Ms Brown to page 710, it is 
20 
paragraph 26 of your affidavit. 
MS BROWN:   I am there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And here just above – in fact sorry 
paragraph 28, just above 28 you have a heading “the 
appointment of the Denel Board during 2015”, correct? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 185 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   That is so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you refer in paragraph 28 to an 
application that you submitted to the Commission to give 
evidence on the testimony of Mr Getatso Klakudi[?], and 
you say I have described the appointment of the 2015 
Denel Board I have nothing to add in terms of the process. 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now that arose as I understand it 
from the evidence that Mr Klakudi gave previously arising 
from the Fundudzi Report is that right? 
10 
MS BROWN:   That is so. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now we are going to have a look in a 
moment at some of the particular individual aspects that 
you have raised some concerns in your affidavit, and I 
would like to take you to the relevant paragraphs so that 
you can explain the concerns and how they arose.   Your 
first concern arising from the Fundudzi Report is this, in 
paragraph 28 you say I am puzzled by the insinuation in 
paragraph 14.6.12 on page 61 of the Fundudzi Report and 
you quote it Ms Brown, you say it reads: 
20 
“In her response Minister Brown failed to deal with 
the fact that the 10 CV’s were not sent to the 
Minister ’s office as they were instead sent to 
David’s personal email address.” 
And you say: 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 186 of 296 
 
“Incidentally 
my 
response 
also 
answers 
the 
Commission’s request to explain Ms Kim Davids' 
role in the appoint of directors to State Owned 
Entities.” 
Correct? 
MS BROWN:   Correct.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you proceed to deal with 
the role of Ms Kim Davids.   Now you will recall that in the 
Fundudzi report there was detailed reference to the 
process that was followed according to the documents – 
10 
the documentary trail that Fundudzi followed of a number 
of emails and various other documents that related to 
nominations of people to the Board of Denel as well as the 
actual process of approval of those nominees and by you 
as Minister and then ultimately a further approval that was 
given by the Cabinet.  Do you recall that was dealt with in 
the Fundudzi Report? 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now one of the things that they 
commented on in the Fundudzi Report was the role that Ms 
20 
Kim Davids played in the process of receiving nominations, 
forwarding them to you for consideration and then also the 
fact that there were certain email addresses that appeared 
of concern or interest to the Fundudzi investigators.   One 
was Ms Davids ...[intervenes]    
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 187 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Sorry?   
MS BROWN:   Sorry, I am sorry to interrupt you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Carry on, one was the email address 
of Ms Davids.   Now what did you want to say? 
MS BROWN:   I wanted to just say that what I know in the 
department that the server was often off. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   And they often used their own addresses, 
their private addresses, but – and Fundudzi actually asked 
10 
me for the role of the appointment of directors, of Kim 
Davids’ role in the appointment of directors to State Owned 
Companies, they didn’t ask me anything about the CV’s 
that were sent, so I responded to the question of the – I 
mean I have written it in all fairness, Fundudzi’s written 
question to me was a simple one, it did not ask me to deal 
with the fact that CV’s were sent to Ms Davids email, all 
that was asked of me was the role in the appointment of 
both members and I said there was no role for her except 
for her to be able to pass on whatever CV’s, whatever 
20 
names, what comes in, whether it’s through a walk-in or it 
is sent via email, all she had to do was pass it in to legal 
...[indistinct]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Let’s just be clear, Ms Davids was at 
that stage your PA, is that right, your secretary? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 188 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What was her ...[intervenes]    
MS BROWN:   My PA. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Her official title was that PA to the 
Minister.  
MS BROWN:   PA to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, so is it correct that as PA she 
would then be receiving certain documents that were 
ultimately addressed to you as Minister she would receive 
it as your PA and then be responsible for passing that on to 
10 
you when required and processing any further steps such 
as a reply, is that right? 
MS BROWN:  Not really Chair, in fact Advocate Kennedy I 
am finding it very disconcerting that I see my own face and 
I can’t see you, so I am not sure if – I see my own face 
twice, there we go, there I see you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you see us now. 
MS BROWN:   I am not talking to a real person Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can see him now. 
MS BROWN:  I can Chair thank you very much., 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you can see me as well? 
MS BROWN:  I can’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t see me? 
MS BROWN:   I can’t see you – there I can see you.  There 
I see you now Chair, but for a while I was only seeing 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 189 of 296 
 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh [laughing]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well I suggest it is a blessing that 
you don’t see me here.  Alright, let’s get back to the issue.  
So yes is there anything else you want to add in relation to 
Ms Davids role? 
MS BROWN:  That’s all I actually want to say, is that she 
didn’t have to see me, now I am seeing me again so now I 
am saying that – she didn’t have to give it to me, she just 
needs to pass it on, it was in essence it didn’t matter 
10 
whose 
CV 
came 
in, 
they 
had 
to 
go 
to 
Legal 
and 
Governance. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Legal and Governance I think that’s 
also been referred to in the Fundudzi Report as LGR, is 
that right?  
MS BROWN:  Well we used to call it the Legal & 
Governance Unit but it is in essence the Legal Governance 
and Risk Unit 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and right now she in fact gave 
the same explanation that you gave in relation to the use 
20 
of a personal email, she in fact is reflected in the Fundudzi 
Report as saying that sometimes her departmental server 
was down as you indicated and she would then use her 
own email address, but one of the other points that was 
raised in the Fundudzi Report is an email address that she 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 190 of 296 
 
received some documents from and you deal with that in 
your paragraph 31, if I may read it into the record, you say 
she, it is referring to Ms Davids: 
“She has no other role to play other than the one I 
described.  This is not a matter of job description 
but a simple matter of common sense.  I had 
responded 
that 
I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
Infoportal1@zofu.com is.  It is unfair that I seem to 
be expected to locate and explain Ms Kim Davids 
alleged interactions with that address.” 
10 
Now of course what Fundudzi have commented on is the 
fact that a number of documents, and we’re going to look 
at a few in a moment, in fact were sent to Ms Davids 
whether or not to her departmental email address or her 
private email address from this particular email address 
that is referred to here, the Infoportal address in its short 
term like that. 
 
Now of course there has been evidence led in the 
Commission previously about this particular email address 
having featured in various other matters and the apparent 
20 
link between that email address and the Gupta Associates, 
such as particularly Mr Essa and Mr Chauler.   You have 
indicated in your affidavit that you were not aware of this 
email address, have you since learnt ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  No. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 191 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry?  Carry on.    
MS BROWN:  I am sorry I am ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes, if you can just wait for the 
question.   Have you since learnt of the connection 
between that email address and the Gupta Associate? 
MS BROWN:  Well I don’t think I know who that email 
address belongs to, I still don’t know who it belongs to, it 
sounds like it could be him, I have listened to some of the 
sessions on the Commission during the Eskom period and 
in essence it’s I listened to somebody yesterday speaking 
10 
on – an IT forensic expert speaking on Ms Daniels’ records 
and that there could have been another number and I am 
assuming that’s probably what you are referring to but I 
can’t tell you that I know who that – and I don’t want to 
speculate, because I am under oath and I don’t want to 
speculate about who the Infoportal address relates to, it is 
not on my computer, it was on Ms Davids’ computer. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    I understand your position Ms 
Brown. Were you aware at the time that there was 
correspondence being received by Ms Davids from this 
20 
particular email address? 
MS BROWN:  No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And so  you wouldn’t have been 
aware if there is a connection between that email address 
and the Gupta Associates, you weren’t aware of that at the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 192 of 296 
 
time and you are not able to comment on that now as I 
understand your position? 
MS BROWN:  I can’t comment on it now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes, may I just ask you this though, 
if the Commission finds on the basis of the evidence was 
led, of which you obviously have no personal knowledge, 
that this was a Gupta linked email address you feel now, 
with the benefit of hindsight any concern.  Do you have any 
comment to make on the possibility that Ms Davis may 
have been receiving correspondence from a Gupta linked 
10 
email 
address 
about 
such 
sensitive 
matters 
as 
the 
nomination and appointment of Board members? 
MS BROWN:  Of course it would be disturbing to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And if you had known about that at 
the time what might you have done? 
MS BROWN:  Well I am in a court case at the moment for 
having asked Ms Davids to leave, I haven’t opposed the 
court matter but I do – I have – so I am not sure what I 
would have done, I mean it is speculative and it is 
speculation but I would have acted. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess the one thing you should be able 
to say with confidence maybe is that at least you would 
have called for an explanation? 
MS BROWN:    Of course Chair I thought the Advocate 
wanted something harsher. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 193 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
No, 
no, 
that 
may 
be 
so 
but 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I am absolutely, I would have asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And then depending on the explanation 
you 
might 
have 
taken 
whatever 
action 
you 
deemed 
appropriate. 
MS BROWN:  Exactly.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Thank you.  Ms Brown what was the 
system in place for the appointment of Board Members to 
10 
entities such as Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is somebody just disturbing you? 
MS BROWN:  I have the television on, somebody has the 
television on and I can hear myself speaking somewhere, 
so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you have asked them to take – to 
switch it off ja. 
MS BROWN:   I am very sorry about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    So you were able to see yourself 
20 
twice and hear yourself twice. 
MS BROWN:  I can hear myself twice, it sounds terrible. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Okay Ms Brown the question is 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  Sorry what is the question? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 194 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes, let me repeat it, at the time you 
– sorry may I just ask at what – roughly at what stage did 
you become Minister of Public Enterprises, can you recall 
roughly the date that you took up that office? 
MS BROWN:  That was one of the most traumatic days for 
me, so I will never forget it, 26 t h of May 2014. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say traumatic Ms Brown, I 
thought that was promotion?   I thought that was a 
promotion. 
10 
MS BROWN:  It fell squarely in the middle of a NASREC 
Conference ...[indistinct] of the scale of – I don’t want to 
speak about it, whoever wants to become a politician 
should speak to me next time.    
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Brown of course that was about a 
year before the Denel Board appointments were made that 
we are looking at here, is that right? 
MS BROWN:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So when you arrived as Minister and 
20 
then when you proceeded to undertake various Board 
appointments, including Denel was there a particular 
system that you followed for the receiving of – or invitation 
for nominations and application and did you have such a 
system and how did you follow it? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 195 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  Yes well there was a system in place.   Let 
me please also say Advocate Kennedy, or Chair actually, 
there was a system in place and this system, and I heard 
denial of this as well, but as far as I was concerned the 
system was to advertise with clear or let’s step one step 
back, every three years Denel, any of the State owned 
companies boards came up for renewal or rotation, they 
call it rotation.   So for – so it is for rotation or retention. 
 
Now when I arrived, so it is not something I do just 
because I am – I woke up one morning and think it’s a 
10 
good idea to rotate the Board.  The Department tells me 
that it is now, the Board has been in place for three months 
– three years – and we now have to assess the Board and 
do all of those things. 
 
Then at the same time we put out an advert for – to 
open it up, now I have heard somebody, I can’t remember 
who it was, saying that they ...[indistinct] this, but I was 
told by the Legal & Governance Unit that the risk was not 
sufficient for what we were requiring and that it would be 
good and I thought it was good anyway, to open up the list 
20 
so that we could have – that list is happening. 
 
The Legal and – so then the advert, it usually runs 
for 
about 
two 
weeks 
or 
so 
and 
then 
the 
Legal 
& 
Governance Unit receives themselves, or, which is more 
popularly done is that it comes to the Minister ’s office, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 196 of 296 
 
whether it is in Pretoria or in Cape Town and they either 
drop it or they email it.   
 
This is all in my mind, this is what I believe 
happened.   I made actually – it was – remember this 
process isn’t a process that was actually carved in stone, 
this is a process that developed within – it was a 
convention – it developed within this – the Department of 
Public Enterprises and so I followed that one as well, and 
then I would get a shortlist of the names, because 
everybody applied, hairdressers, you know people who 
10 
were working, everybody applied and so there were always 
a whole number of people who applied for the Boards, so 
what would happen is that the Governance Unit within the 
Legal & Governance Unit, will receive this and they will sift 
through all the – they will sift through all the CV’s and if 
there are no CV’s if there are names with telephone 
numbers, where somebody nominates somebody they will 
go the extra mile, and then I would get the matrix, a very 
large sheet that says these are the people who actually 
qualify for the portfolio, whichever portfolio it is. 
20 
 
Chair this happened seven years ago, that’s my 
recollection.   Now I think – okay let me just leave it at 
that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.   Ms Brown there 
is reference in these papers to your indicating when asked 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 197 of 296 
 
by Fundudzi that there were a few people who had actually 
approached you to be appointed to the Denel Board and 
you indicated in your response that you then gave them 
directions as it were to the Legal & Governance Committee 
where they should submit their applications formally.  Is 
that correct? 
MS BROWN:     Well I either did that or I gave them – I 
never knew their numbers and I wouldn’t give out details, 
private numbers to not – yes strangers to them, but not 
strangers to me, so I would give my own office’s number 
10 
and tell them to write to my own office. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS BROWN:  Or send an email to my own office.   There 
were not a large number of people who did that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, now you have touched on the 
broad approach that was followed or the system that had 
been followed from the past into this stage, can I ask you 
to what extent did you take into account, if at all, the 
particular skills and qualifications of individual applicants 
or nominees and a possible need to have a balance 
20 
between the skills of people who would sit on one of your 
Boards, on that payroll. 
MS BROWN:  I think it’s - Chair I think it is an incredibly 
important – that was what the matrix constituted because in 
the advert it would tell you that we need people with 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 198 of 296 
 
financial skills, legal skills.  We need people with knowledge 
in aviation.  We need people in with knowledge in energy.  
We need people and so forth.  So there was a wide – we 
need people with forensic capabilities.  We need people with 
internal 
audit 
capabilities.   
 
Now I cannot look it was seven years ago I cannot 
really remember what exactly went into the adverts and I do 
not have any documentation for it. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  But I think that is a crucial and a very 
10 
important part of appointing boards. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  Now you then proceed in your 
affidavit to make some comments on the appointment of Mr 
Daniel Mantsha as Chairman of Denel.  You see that at the 
foot of page 711? 
MS BROWN:  3.2? 
ADV KENNEDY:  In fact the headings at the foot of page 711 
and then 712 paragraph 33 is your comment.  Now… 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  It is correct is it not that Mr Mantsha was 
20 
nominated as a new board member in 2015 and also as 
chairperson?  Is that correct?  Ms Brown.  It looks like we 
have lost her.  We have lost the connection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like she is frozen. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes.   
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 199 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the technicians will attend to it.   
MS BROWN:  Nominated as Chair and board member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay you – you had frozen Ms Brown 
so we did not hear what you were saying except what the 
few words you have just mentioned now as you ended your 
response.  So please start your response afresh. 
MS BROWN:  Okay.  I am saying that it was seven years ago 
and I remember him being nominated as a board member but 
I think from amongst the group I cannot remember really.  
You will – I am not sure if he was nominated as chair and 
10 
board member.  I think he was just nominated as board 
member.  To you Chair and to Advocate Kennedy this was 
seven years ago I do not remember the granular details. 
ADV KENNEDY:  No I fully understand that.  My question 
was simply that you approved the appointment of Mr 
Mantsha as both a director and as chairperson from mid. 
MS BROWN:  I did. 
ADV KENNEDY:  From mid-2015 is that correct? 
MS BROWN:  In 2015? 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes.  Now can I take you now to another 
20 
document page 767 one of those that were furnished to your 
legal team yesterday.   
MS BROWN:  Well after nine. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes we are sorry that it came at a fairly 
late stage. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 200 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  Time – I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not say last time Ms Brown you 
are – did you not say last time that you are… 
MS BROWN:  I am not placing any objections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are retired.  Did you not say last you 
are retired?  How can you complain about time.  You have 
got all the time. 767 you said? 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Ms Brown do you have 767 yet? 
10 
MS BROWN:  I do have it. 
ADV KENNEDY:  That is a cabinet memorandum.  It is dated 
the 11t h of May 2015. 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Now that is as I understand it from the 
document is a document that would have been generated 
from within your department and with your approval to then 
submit your decision to appoint various members of the new 
board to cabinet for its final approval.  Is that right? 
MS BROWN:  Yes that would be – that would be so. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY:  As Minister you were the Minister of State 
representing the state as the nominal shareholder in Denel, 
is that right? 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  So in terms of your… 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 201 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  Shareholder representative. 
ADV 
KENNEDY: 
 
Shareholder’s 
representative 
that 
is 
correct.  So in ordinary company law you as the shareholder 
or the shareholder representative you would have the 
decision making powers to appoint board members but 
because this was a government owned entity on whose 
behalf 
you 
were 
the 
shareholder’s 
representative 
you 
presumably would then put it to cabinet for its approval, is 
that right? 
MS BROWN:  Yes I – I would take it to the ANC Deployment 
10 
Committee and then I will take it to cabinet. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  And – and it was then sent to 
cabinet over – only once you had approved the appointment 
of these individuals to the board and Mr Mantsha as 
chairperson in particular, is that right? 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right now this memorandum helpfully sets 
out the – the persons who were now approved by you and 
were now being put to the cabinet for approval and if I can 
take you to the next page 768 you will see at paragraph 5 
20 
headed Discussion.   
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Now I am not going to read everything into 
the record but effectively it refers to the need to rotate 
members or to appoint new members and it seems that was 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 202 of 296 
 
decided was that one of the outgoing board members was 
selected for re-appointment, is that correct? 
MS BROWN:  I – well yes it is – I can see it now yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right and in fact it was a Mr Motseke I 
believe we see that in 5.2 that he would be… 
MS BROWN:  I see that there. 
ADV KENNEDY:  That he would be re-appointed for the 
purpose of continuity.  But apart from him there were nine 
other members of the outgoing board who were not to be re-
appointed is that right? 
10 
MS BROWN:  That is so. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  Now the document then says and 
here I would like to read it into the record if I may?   
“It is recommended – this is paragraph 5.3 it 
is recommended that Mr Daniel Mantsha be 
appointed 
as 
non-executive 
director 
and 
chairperson of the Denel board and Mr 
Tamsanqa Msomi and then it gives all the 
rest of the names that is Msomi, Mahumapelo 
that is Mr Tanyame I think it is, Mahumapelo, 
20 
Ms Pinkie 
Mahlangu, Lieutenant General 
Nkabinde retired, Ms Mpho Kgomongoe, Ms 
Khumbudzo Ntshavheni and Ms Mandindi and 
Ms Mokoena be appointed to the board with 
effect from 14 July – I beg your pardon 24 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 203 of 296 
 
July 2015 for a period of three years subject 
to annual review by the Minister of Public 
Enterprises.” 
 
That is what was recommended. 
MS BROWN:  That is – yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right. And then what is then set out from 
paragraph 5.4 is the profiles of the new nominees and the 
first is that of Mr Mantsha 541.  It says: 
“Mr Daniel Mantsha obtained BJuris in 1991 
and LLB in 1993 both from the University of 
10 
Venda.  Mr Mantsha is an attorney who has 
acquired valuable experience over the years 
in corporate finance, transactional advising, 
business 
management, 
commercial 
law, 
media 
and 
communication. 
 
He 
has 
participated in major transactions such as 
advising the City of Johannesburg on issuing 
the 
first 
municipal 
bond 
in 
the African 
continent corporatisation of Eskom as well as 
a 
transactional 
advisor 
to 
the 
National 
20 
Department of Labour on procurement of IT 
systems.  Mr Mantsha is recommended for 
appointment as non-executive director and 
chairperson of the Denel board.  He brings 
expertise in transactions, business strategy 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 204 of 296 
 
and law to the board.  His CV is herewith 
attached as Annexure B1.” 
 
Now we have not included the CV just to try and keep 
the documentation slim here.  Were you satisfied on the 
basis of this summary of his background that Mr Mantsha 
was a suitable person to be appointed as chairperson of the 
Denel board? 
MS BROWN:  A decision I made seven years ago Chair it – I 
– I signed off on this document so the whole document I 
supported.  The assumption – the only assumption I can 
10 
make is that whoever is appointed to this committee that 
they have all been vetted and they all are – that they all 
have been vetted and they all have the – the application – or 
the 
expertise 
that 
they 
say 
they 
have 
and 
that 
my 
department would have done that. 
ADV KENNEDY:  What is the committee – I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what – I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  But Ms 
Brown why would you make an assumption about that?  Why 
would you not satisfy yourself that it has been done?  It is 
such an important thing. 
20 
MS BROWN:  How will you – I need to satisfy myself other 
than through a well-equipped, well run department.  I had no 
reason to believe that any of the – especially that unit in 
particular that any of them would put forward and not check 
– or not vet in the way they are supposed to do so.  In fact 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 205 of 296 
 
the vetting does not only happen with them but it has also 
happened at – takes place with an external audit.  I am just 
not sure what you mean Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you see … 
MS BROWN:  What was it that you think I was supposed to 
do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you have to make a decision – 
an 
important 
decision 
such 
as 
either 
appointing 
or 
recommending members of a board you must satisfy yourself 
that anyone you recommend or you appoint is suitable and 
10 
appropriate to be appointed.  Okay.   
Now you cannot satisfy yourself on important things 
by making assumptions.  You have got to say I want to be 
satisfied.  If somebody for example – if it is important that 
somebody should have for example a certain degree you 
cannot or you should not just be happy with a line from in his 
CV that he has or she has the degree you need to see proof 
of the degree.  You should not make an assumption when it 
comes to important matters.   
So I do not know whether when you said you 
20 
assumed whether that was deliberate or whether it was a 
manner of talking but I expected you to – I would have 
expected you to satisfy yourself that certain important 
requirements that they needed to comply with or meet before 
you could recommend them or appoint them were met and 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 206 of 296 
 
your department should place before you documentation that 
would satisfy you.  That is what I am talking about.   
MS BROWN:  Yes and we – they have both an external – 
they have an internal arrangement where they do the vetting 
and then they have an external arrangement.  Then I look at 
it within and I – I am a bit fuzzy in my head about how but I 
think where they present it to me as a committee.   
They have checked the qualifications of the person, 
they have checked the credit record of the person.  They 
have checked – I mean I cannot remember what they all 
10 
check but they check a whole number of things so that they 
vetted – vet these people.   
And as – when I came in there was a company called 
Nexus who would do the external vetting and this has been a 
process that has taken place for I think a couple of ministers 
before me as well and I adopted that process too.  
So of course if Mr Daniel Mantsha only had a matric 
and was saying as stay at home for his – or he was a 
beautician or he – no I do not want to rubbish anybody’s jobs 
but if he was just sitting at home and he had a matric of 
20 
course I would not approve it but they – they checked 
whether you were – and I am using him as an example 
whether he really has a BJuris, whether he had a LLB they 
check those things.   
I asked him that in the meeting.  Have you checked 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 207 of 296 
 
qualifications, have you checked whether or not they 
participated in major transactions and so forth?   
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were assured? 
MS BROWN:  And I was assured.  I did not just take the 
document and sign the document off.  I have to apply my 
mind to the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy I interrupted you. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I interrupted you, you may continue. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Brown if I can take 
10 
you to page 773. 
MS BROWN:  77? 
ADV KENNEDY:  3.   
MS BROWN:  I have 773. 
ADV KENNEDY:  That is part of this report that served 
before cabinet – the cabinet memorandum and that bears 
your signature, is that correct? 
MS BROWN:  That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY:  So in effect this was confirming that you 
had approved the appointment of Mr Mantsha and his 
20 
colleagues to the board with Mr Mantsha as Chairperson and 
you were effectively recommending those appointments to 
the cabinet for their approval too.  Is that correct? 
MS BROWN:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Okay.  Just for the sake of completeness 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 208 of 296 
 
can I take you back to an earlier document at page 740.  Do 
you have that? 
MS BROWN:  740 seems to be a description – my – it is just 
an index. 
ADV KENNEDY:  No 740 on the top left. 
MS BROWN:  Yes tell me what – I mean we were going quite 
fine now. I need to know what the… 
ADV KENNEDY:  What the document is? 
MS BROWN:  So it says Control F  
ADV KENNEDY:  So it is 
10 
MS BROWN:  7? 
ADV KENNEDY:  740.  It is a decision memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Top left page – top left page it is a 
memorandum from… 
MS BROWN:  Okay I have it.  I have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it? 
MS BROWN:  It is the one with Melanchton and so forth. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  Melanchton Makobe 
ADV KENNEDY:  That is correct.  It came from Melanchton 
20 
Makobe who was at that stage your acting Deputy Director 
General LGR, is that correct. 
MS BROWN:  That is so.  Oh well I do not – I cannot 
remember but it must so. 
ADV KENNEDY:  No I am just asking you to have a look at it 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 209 of 296 
 
and just to reacquaint yourself with it.  So that is a 
memorandum that came from Mr Makobe from the LG the 
Legal and Governance Unit that you have indicated earlier 
was responsible for processing and making and evaluating 
and making recommendations on the various nominees, 
correct? 
MS BROWN:  Yes this could be so. 
ADV KENNEDY:  And it was addressed to yourself, you see 
that? 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY:  And then if I can take you please to page 
742 paragraph 2.2.  You have that? 
MS BROWN:  742 yes I have got 742. 
ADV KENNEDY:  And it is paragraph 
MS BROWN:  Paragraph. 
ADV KENNEDY:  2.2 Cabinet memorandum 4 of 2015 
appointment of non-executive directors to the Denel board. 
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV 
KENNEDY: 
 
Now 
this 
again 
refers 
to 
the 
recommendations.  This was as it appears from the rest of 
20 
the document was a motivation to you to approve the 
appointment of Mr Mantsha as the chairperson and the other 
individuals as the other directors of the Denel board.  
Correct? 
MS BROWN:  Correct. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 210 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY:  And if I can take you to page 745 it 
appears that you signed that against the word approved 
within a circle.  You see that? 
MS BROWN:  Yes I would have done that.  
ADV KENNEDY:  Right. 
MS BROWN:  I am looking there.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  And so this approval reflects the process 
that was reached within the department you then approved 
the motivation and thereafter what happened was the cabinet 
memorandum that we have looked at a moment ago is that 
10 
right? 
MS BROWN:  That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  Now I am not going into the – into 
any detail in the text of the document but that simply refers 
as did the cabinet memorandum to the fact that there needed 
to be new appointments made to the board only one would 
be reappointed from the old board, the rest would be fresh 
appointees and that included Mr Mantsha and that is what 
the basis on which you approved the recommendation.  
Correct? 
20 
MS BROWN:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Now did you know Mr Mantsha before you 
made this decision? 
MS BROWN:  No I did not know anybody on that board. 
MS BROWN:  Nobody at all.  Had you not come across Mr 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 211 of 296 
 
Mantsha? 
MS BROWN:  No, no I am – I was a parochial provincial 
politician for most of my life.  The last four years I went into 
national.  I have – I have lived and stayed and been the 
speaker and the premier and everything else in my own 
province. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes but the question was specifically about 
Mr Mantsha.  Whatever – however … 
MS BROWN:  00:22:22 I have never met Mr Mantsha before. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Okay.  
10 
MS BROWN:  I have never met any of the board members 
before. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  Were you aware – so you would – 
but you would have been aware from presumably the CV and 
whatever the department’s LGR unit put up to you including 
the 
synopsis 
of 
Mr 
Mantsha’s 
qualifications 
and 
his 
experience.   
What – what the good points were in his favour to 
select him above the others as the chairperson of Denel. You 
relied on what was – what the information that was given to 
20 
you. 
MS BROWN:  I think it was based on information that was 
given to me. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  I cannot – I really cannot remember what 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 212 of 296 
 
exactly the reasons were. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. Because you did not know him 
personally you just testified so it must have been based on 
information that was given to you, correct? 
MS BROWN:  Well information given to me both in the 
meeting as well as – in the meeting where they present the 
documentation to me. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  As well as documentation. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
10 
MS BROWN:  And then we take it through the process and 
then we come back and we write up – they write up the final 
documentation for cabinet. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right.  Now you were in your second 
affidavit – can I take you back to page 712? 
CHAIRPERSON:  712 Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes Chair.   
MS BROWN:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY:  You then deal with something that arose in 
the Fundudzi Report and they commented in the report on 
20 
the fact that Mr Mantsha had been admitted as an attorney 
some years before but at some stage prior to his nomination 
for appointment to the Denel board had been struck off as an 
attorney.  He had later been re-instated as an attorney and 
you were – you were asked specifically to deal with this 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 213 of 296 
 
aspect.  Now you - – if I may read into the record 33.1 this – 
“I have only this to say 33.1 the striking off 
occurred in 2007 three years later in 2011 
the High Court saw it fit to reinstate him to 
the role of attorneys.” 
Now were you aware at the time that you approved 
the recommendation that he should be appointed were you 
aware at that stage or only subsequently that at a particular 
point in his career he had been struck off as an attorney? 
MS BROWN:  No in fact I think I only got to know about it 
10 
after and I did see in Mr 00:25:35 statement that he or 
somebody’s statement that they say that they actually told 
me. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Right. 
MS BROWN:  Now I cannot remember that but I – I heard 
about it post when – and that is why somewhere along the 
line my spokesperson is called by the media and the media 
asked about his background. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  And so I – and that is how I got to know about 
20 
it. 
ADV KENNEDY:  So that is… 
MS BROWN:  I did not – and this was one of the difficulties I 
had with the vetting process because you know people are 
vetted and you do not have all the information. So how – how 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 214 of 296 
 
can you believe and trust the vetting process?  But that 
happened anyway.  So ja. 
ADV KENNEDY:  So if I understand you correctly as far as 
you can recall you were not aware at the time that you 
approved the appointment of Mr Mantsha as chairperson and 
recommended that for final approval to the cabinet you were 
not aware of the history that he had for some period been 
struck off as an attorney. 
MS BROWN:  You see Chair I would have prepared myself 
for cabinet if I knew that Mr Mantsha so I cannot – you know 
10 
it was just seven years – so long ago. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes. 
MS BROWN:  But I think – I think I got to know about it 
because I remember something about my spokesperson 
coming to me and saying that there is a media enquiry about 
my appointment of Mr Mantsha as the chair.  I think it 
happened that way.   
So I immediately phoned Mr Mantsha I did this 
personally.  I phoned Mr Mantsha and I asked him about it.  I 
remember that as well.  But then I remember very little else 
20 
about it. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Now there – the facts that you record there 
in paragraph 33.1 the striking off occurred in 2007 three 
years later in 2011 the High Court saw it fit to reinstate him.  
You recall where you got that information from? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 215 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  I – I cannot remember. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Okay. 
MS BROWN:  But I must – I must have had that – I must 
have gotten that information from Mr Mantsha himself. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Yes.  In fact it is true that he was struck off 
in around 2007 and around 2011 he was reinstated as – as – 
on the role of attorneys that – that is factually correct but it 
was just interested to know where you got the information 
from.  
MS BROWN:  No, no I would have gotten it from either – or I 
10 
would have asked the spokesperson to do research about – 
on the matter or I would have handed it over to the legal 
committee.   
I mean to the legal unit within the legal and 
governance unit. Because somehow I would have gotten that 
or I would have sent it to my PA and say please send it off to 
the 
legal 
and 
governance 
unit, 
send 
it 
off 
to 
the 
spokesperson, send it off to whoever. 
ADV KENNEDY:  Your affidavit then continues in 33.2  
“There was no legal impediment or any other 
20 
impediment 
that 
was 
flagged 
in 
the 
recommendations made to me during May 
2015 when he was appointed.” 
Now the memo that was sent to you that you signed we a 
saw a moment ago making the recommendation that certainly 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 216 of 296 
 
does not indicate that there was any legal impediment to 
have been recommended or appointed.  And in fact, at that 
stage, factually, it is so that he had been reinstated as an 
attorney.  What you say, though, in 33.3 is: 
“Between his readmission in 2011 and 2015, I 
was and am still not aware of any factor that 
may have disqualified him from being a director 
or a chairman of a board...” 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now let us accept for a moment that 
10 
there was no reason to disqualify him.  What you then go 
on to is – to go beyond the question of whether he was 
disqualified from being appointed to a question of whether 
he should have been accepted, nonetheless.  And what you 
have said in your affidavit is this, 33.4: 
“Surely, one must give individuals the benefit 
of doubt. 
The alleged transgressions occurred before 
2015 when he was struck off. 
I would like to believe that he had somehow 
20 
atoned enough to be readmitted three years 
later in 2011. 
Now to hold it against him that he was struck 
off eight years ago does not seem fair to me. 
I do believe people must be allowed to forget 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 217 of 296 
 
past 
transgressions 
if 
they 
have 
atoned 
therefore...” 
 
Now let us leave aside the question of whether 
there was any legal disqualification.  You are probably 
right that there was no legal disqualification of him being 
considered for appointment but here you were dealing with 
whether it would be appropriate to appoint somebody and 
your attitude here seems to be:  Well, he must have atoned 
for his sins, as it were, because he was readmitted.  So, 
therefore, one should give people a second chance.  You 
10 
still stand by that view Ms Brown? 
MS BROWN:   No, Advocate, surely, I stand firmly by that.  
You know, so many people go to – look, let me just say I 
stand by that rule.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS BROWN:   Or that view.  I am also assuming that it is 
quite okay to have an opinion that people can have second 
changes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, but here we are dealing with 
second chances for what?  He was now being appointed, 
20 
not only as a non-executive director but also as the 
chairperson of a major state organ – a major state entity, 
Denel, 
which 
had 
expenditure 
and 
revenue 
involving 
hundreds of thousands, if not billions of rands and where 
these were public files for which you were responsible.

What I simply want to ask you is.  Are you 
suggesting that if somebody has previously been struck off 
and the judgment of his striking off in fact reflects that 
what was serious irregularities in relation to his accounting 
for clients’ funds, are you saying that, well, everybody 
must get a second chance, not just the ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   ...this happened after, post-facto. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   What happened after? 
MS 
BROWN: 
 
 
When 
I 
heard 
about 
Mr 
Mantsha’s 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   I actually do – I do believe that people – he 
was – firstly, let me take one step back.  Firstly, 
Mr Mantsha, three years after he was found guilty of 
something or he has been struck off the role, three years 
later his peers at court actually brought him back and 
disbarred him.  I do not know what the legal word for that 
will be . 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, it is struck from the roll. 
MS BROWN:   ...and then he is disbarred.  So three years 
20 
later this happens to Mr Mantsha.  Now I am asking the 
question – I am wondering what your question is.  What 
does your question relate to, sir?  Is it relating to my  
morality around it or my moral standing around it or is it 
relating to a legal standing around it? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 219 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, unfortunately, Ms Brown I am 
not here to ask your – to answer your questions here.  You 
are here to answer mine. 
MS BROWN:   [laughs]  That is quite true. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I am not trying to a cheap shot.  
What – let me just put this thing in context.  The 
Chairperson has obviously for sometime been hearing 
masses of evidence about allegations of state capture in 
relation to entities such as Denel and the Chairperson has 
heard various testimony relating to various transactions, 
10 
some of which involved particular decisions taken by 
Mr Mantsha as chairperson.   
 
For 
example, 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
this 
Commission has heard evidence relating to a transaction in 
which the procurement officials at Denel were not prepared 
to sign off their approval because there were various 
breaches.  And ultimately, Mr Mantsha himself, although he 
was a Non-executive Director, saw fit as the chairperson to 
sign off approval for a particular transaction.   
 
That was a transaction that involved a contract 
20 
between Denel and an entity know as VR Laser in which 
the Guptas and their associates as well as the former 
President Zuma’s son had a major commercial interest.   
 
And so the Chairperson of this Commission has 
heard that evidence.  One of the factors the Chairperson 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 220 of 296 
 
may consider relevant in the report that he will be writing 
for the benefit of the President and the nation, relates to 
how such situations – what situations may actually have 
arisen, whether there was state capture, whether there 
were 
irregularities 
and 
whether 
there 
was 
proper 
accountability.   
 
Now one of the issues the Chairperson, no 
doubt, may consider relevant is how it came about that 
particular individuals came to be appointed to boards such 
as Denel.  And Mr Mantsha who gave evidence here, a few 
10 
weeks ago, has confirmed that shortly after he was 
appointed as chairperson he happens to have taken within 
a space of a few months a few trips overseas, sometimes 
onboard a private plane owned by a Gupta owned company 
or by arrangements made by a Gupta official, Mr Chwala to 
make bookings, etcetera.   
 
Now one of the concerns the Chairperson may in 
his wisdom, it is obviously not my function to decide these 
things, what the Chairperson of this Commission may 
consider relevant is whether the systems that were in place 
20 
for the appointment of persons such as Mr Mantsha, the 
positions that were so serious and so senior and so 
responsible, 
whether 
those 
systems 
were 
adequate 
systems, whether they were an appropriate of systems, 
whether they were misused or properly used, whether the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 221 of 296 
 
systems may be inadequate. 
 
And the Chairperson may consider it appropriate 
to make recommendations to the President as to whether 
there should be changes and safeguards introduced into 
systems in future to ensure that there are no problems of 
the thought of nature that may have become apparent 
during their testimony.   
 
I hope I have made it clear what the context in 
which my question is being posed.  And I am not 
suggesting that you should take full blame or any blame for 
10 
anything in particular.  I am just questioning you in relation 
to how you went about your task as Minister.  What you 
knew.   
 
You have already told us that you did not know 
at the time you approved his appointment that he had been 
struck off but this paragraph that I have just read out to 
you from your very own affidavit, suggest that if you had 
known it would not have been a factor that would have 
been taken into account by you as something negative 
which would mean that Mr Mantsha should not be preferred 
20 
above any other candidate.  Do you understand the context 
in which I am putting it to you? 
MS BROWN:   I understand the context and I am saying 
that it is not preferred.  It is the fact that it happened and 
it was now post-facto and I now had to defend the decision 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 222 of 296 
 
that I have taken. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   And having said that.  For as long as you 
have a state-owned company governed by two acts that are 
almost 
directly 
in 
opposition 
with 
each 
other. 
 The 
Companies Act which actually says the Minister has the 
right to appoint a board or the shareholder has – the main 
shareholder has the right to appoint the board.  And the 
PFMA – then you will not have that problem because then 
you are leaving it up to the morality or the political 
10 
believes or the religious beliefs of somebody.  You are 
leaving it up somebody to make a decision based on their 
own believe of something. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Well, Ms ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   And I think it might be useful to actually 
have a firmer recommendation because in ten years’ time I 
could 
come 
back 
to 
the 
commission 
– 
I 
mean, 
a 
commission like your own, state inquiry ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the Brown Commission. 
MS BROWN:   [laughs]  It could be. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Brown ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...let us get to the point.  Let us get to 
the point.  Let us get to the point is. 
MS BROWN:   No, the point is ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 223 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Hang on.  I will tell you what 
the point is that I am talking about.  I am understand your 
evidence to be.  As far as you are concerned, the fact that 
Mr Mantsha had been struck off as an attorney did not 
matter, as far as you are concerned, in terms of whether he 
should have been – you should have appointed him as a 
Director of Denel and on whether you should have 
appointed him as Chairperson.  Is my understanding of 
your evidence correct? 
MS BROWN:   And he as reappointed.  Chair, I know – he 
10 
was reappointed.  He was reappointed by his peers in a 
court, in a high court to be able to do his services three 
years later again.  I actually accepted that.  And you are 
right ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I am right? 
MS BROWN:   ...to that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   ...he has been reappointed by his own 
peers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS BROWN:   In the high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the high court are not his peers.  
His peers are his attorneys. 
MS BROWN:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The high court are judges, okay.  But 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 224 of 296 
 
you are right to say he had been reinstated by the high 
court and of course when the high court reinstated him, it 
would have heard whether the Law Society had any 
objection to him being reinstated and the Law Society, 
which consists of attorneys, would have had a say on 
whether he should be reinstated.  He had been struck off, 
it seems in 2007 and he was reinstated as an attorney in 
2011.  You mean that you do not see that as a blot on his 
record as something wrong, as something negative on his 
record, the fact that he had been struck off? 
10 
MS BROWN:   Of course I see it as something negative but 
I have taken – I took that decision that because – and I 
fully agree with you - that he has been cleared by the high 
court and he was now for almost eight years able to 
practise without having recommitted the crime that he 
committed into 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Ms Brown.  He had not been cleared 
of his transgressions.  He had been found guilty of his 
transgressions.  He had been struck off.  For a certain 
number of years he could not practise lawfully but he had 
20 
been reinstated.  That is not the same as been cleared.  
You understand that?  If can make an example for you.  It 
is like somebody who is convicted of a crime, he goes to 
prison, serves the sentence and then they are released 
back to society after they have served...  They have been 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 225 of 296 
 
convicted and that remains on their record.  Do you 
understand that comparison? 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you – when you heard that he had 
been struck off, did you find out what it is that had caused 
him to be struck off? 
MS BROWN:   I actually cannot remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And...  You see, for me it would – I 
would have expected you to have been maybe shocked 
when you heard after you had appointed him, not only as a 
10 
Director but as Chairperson of the Board of Denel when 
you hear that he had been struck off as an attorney before.  
And that that would have caused you to say:  What – why 
was he struck off?  I want to see all the records.  Or, I 
want to hear – I want all the facts.   
 
And I would not have expected you to have 
forgotten that if you had known what it was because I 
would have expected that you would have said, but maybe 
I am wrong, you would have said:  Oh, why was I not told 
about such an important thing? 
20 
MS BROWN:   Oh, no I did say that Chair.  I did raise it 
with our Legal and Governance Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS BROWN:   Because I – just the fact that that has 
escaped them, was quite – for me quite complex.  I did not 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 226 of 296 
 
understand that they – why they missed him or why they 
missed that in particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   And I had to then find out afterwards that 
they have this double vetting and I had to find out 
afterwards that he actually – and maybe you are right 
Chair, maybe I should not have appointed him.  I – and 
maybe I should not have appointed him and not held the 
view that in that I held in 33.4 and 33.5.  I mean, maybe it 
is an important thing when you make recommendations or 
10 
find people guilty of things, that is something that you will 
have to put in your recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, I will be frank with you.  I 
think that to the extent that somebody did not do his or her 
job to establish that Mr Mantsha had been struck off before 
and bring that to the attention – to your attention, was very 
bad.  But I hope it is not a situation where somebody was 
aware of the fact that he had been struck off the role but 
realised if that was put up, was disclosed, he would not be 
appointed to the board and decided not to make sure it was 
20 
disclosed.   
 
And then somebody who had been struck off the 
roll and had only been reinstated in the past or three years 
or so was then appointed to the board.  But what concerns 
me, Ms Brown, is that when this fact is brought to your 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 227 of 296 
 
attention you seemed to have thought that it would not 
have made any difference.  You would still have appointed 
him even if you had know as a Director of Denel and as 
Chairperson of the board.  That is how I read your 
evidence.  Am I correct? 
MS BROWN:   No.  Chair, if I knew that before I would 
have taken a different stance on it.  The fact that I have 
now appointed the board and it actually – I think I say it 
somewhere – I think it came about – it did not come 
immediately.  I was made aware during June that he had 
10 
been struck off the role. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to interrupt. 
MS BROWN:   I ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry to interrupt, Ms Brown.  
May it just help you and perhaps the Commission to get to 
that.  You are quite right.  You did deal with it in 33.5.   
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say this: 
“After he was appointed in May 2015, I was 
made aware during June 2015 that he had 
20 
been struck off the roll. 
On the considerations I mentioned above, I 
gave him the benefit of the doubt...” 
MS BROWN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that last sentence does not say 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 228 of 296 
 
you would have taken a different decision if you had 
known.  It says:  On the considerations I mentioned above, 
I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  That sentence means, 
you would have given the benefit of the doubt even if you 
had become aware of this before.  That is how I understand 
it.  What do you say to that? 
MS BROWN:   I personally feel that I could have given him 
the benefit of the doubt post the appointment but I – and if 
I knew it before, I am not – I think I would have appointed 
him but I did appoint him even though he – a month after 
10 
his appointment this issue happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, why did you not when you got to 
hear that he had been struck of the roll, when you got to 
hear in June after he had been appointed in May, why did 
you not take the view that we cannot have somebody who 
had been struck off as an attorney and had been – well, 
who had been struck off as an attorney, of course he was 
reinstated – leave the board of such an important SOE?   
 
That is the attitude I would have expected you to 
take.  Is there something wrong with my expectation?  I 
20 
would have expected you to say:  There are so many 
attorneys whose records are impeccable who have not 
been struck off.  Why can we not find somebody else if we 
want an attorney as chairperson of the board?  
 
Why should we take somebody who has been 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 229 of 296 
 
struck off, who was struck off and got reinstated?   
MS BROWN:   Chair, you might be right about that but I – 
the point is that I have – I also feel that I have given 
Mr Mantsha another chance to be able to, for want of a 
better word, to redeem himself and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But he can redeem himself in his 
practise as an attorney.  The high court gave him a chance 
to go back to practise.  He can redeem himself there.  This 
is an SOE.  A very important SOE.  You need people of – 
with good track records and integrity and so on, is it not? 
10 
MS BROWN:   Yes, Chair.  And I mean – and I think that 
our vetting process will actually ensure that we do have 
people with good ethics and good moral standing and so 
forth.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS BROWN:   But it did not happen. And I mean, I cannot 
– I almost cannot think of answer for you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   ...at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MS BROWN:   The point is.  I thought, and I say it again, 
and when I was writing the affidavit, I think that I thought 
that he was now disbarred from – he was now allowed to 
practise again after three years of being barred that it 
would mean that he would be able to – he would have 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 230 of 296 
 
atoned and he was admitted three years later in 2011 and 
four years later he gets appointed to the board.  I did not 
think about it in the way you have been thinking about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   And maybe I was wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS BROWN:   But I have done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Brown, just to 
complete this topic and let me ask you this.  You indicated 
10 
at an early stage of your evidence that you, in fact, had a 
large number of applications.  Many people applied to be 
appointed to the board.  Some, in fact, even approached 
you directly and you directed them to the – your office 
where they should follow the correct formalities and so 
forth. 
 
Can you recall why it was that Mr Mantsha 
particularly stood out?  Presumable, if you as the Minister 
as the shareholder representative are making effectively 
the decision because your department cannot make that 
20 
decision.  You have to make that decision subject to 
Cabinet 
approval 
but 
of 
course 
you 
made 
your 
recommendation to Cabinet.   
 
Presumable when you as a responsible Cabinet 
Minister for Public Enterprises are faced with a large 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 231 of 296 
 
number of people who have either been nominated or who 
have applied to be appointed to the board and you are 
choosing who the board should be and who in particular 
out of them should be the chairperson of the board. 
 
I am just interested to explore with you how 
would you process that sort of decision?  You did not know 
Mr Mantsha at all from before.  You have had his CV and 
the summary of his experience and so forth given to you, 
the internal documents.   
 
Presumable 
you 
would 
be 
looking 
for 
a 
10 
chairperson at somebody who is not only a good, well-
qualified candidate but somebody who presumable should 
stand head and shoulders above other candidates in order 
to appoint him or her as chairperson of the board. 
 
Now if you did not know Mr Mantsha from before, 
what was standing to his credit?  We know – I am going to 
take you through in a moment the profile of the other 
people whom you appointed.  I think there was three or 
four other people who were lawyers appointed to this 
board.   
20 
 
I think the Commission may find it of interest to 
understand 
your 
thought 
process 
in 
deciding 
why 
Mr Mantsha stood head and shoulders above the rest.  May 
I start by asking you this?  Am I right in assuming that you 
would not just rubberstamp what was put on your desk by 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 232 of 296 
 
the committee, by the Legal and Governance People?  Is 
that right? 
MS BROWN:   Well, they would not put it on my desk.  
They had presented it to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  I accept that and that is all part 
of the proper process and you should have taken that into 
account.  What I am asking you, though, is.  It would not 
be 
just 
a 
manual 
rubberstamping 
of 
whatever 
recommendation was put before you.  You, presumable, as 
the real decision maker, subject to ratification or a final 
10 
approval by the Cabinet, you had to be satisfied that when 
– whoever recommended to you that Mr Mantsha should be 
appointed that there was good reason for that.  He was the 
best candidate among the many candidates for the job.  
Would that be fair to say? 
MS BROWN:   Yes.  I think that was the process where 
they would identity two or three people.  I cannot 
remember but ja two or three people could be the board 
chair.  And they would be looking at people who had 
knowledge of big projects, people with knowledge of – ag, 
20 
a range of issues.  Like, people who know about business 
cases. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   People who know how to manage a financial 
process.  As I said, huge projects, financing.  Those kind 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 233 of 296 
 
of people ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   ...who, in essence, will be able to also 
legally manage the process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS BROWN:   So they will be able to do the – they will be 
able to oversee the contract that or whatever it is that they 
need to do and they will be able to do so legally.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   So I am not – I am unsure about how the 
10 
choice of Mr Mantsha or any other board member because 
it was around that time as well that most of the boards 
were appointed, you know, late 2014, early 2015.  So all 
six boards had been appointed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Let me say immediately that I 
have no difficulty with your suggestion that you should be 
looking at people for particular skills.  What I am intrigued 
about is what made Mr Mantsha such a special, especially 
suitable person because you did not know him, you had 
CVs from a whole lot of people, as you said although you 
20 
ultimately retracted people even like hairdressers and so 
forth applied and then you correctly pointed out of course 
you should not discriminate against anybody but you were 
looking for particular skills and let me accept immediately 
that a legal skill is something useful for a Chairperson to 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 234 of 296 
 
have, but why Mr Mantsha? 
 
Let me just take you through it.  We will see in a 
moment that there were, as I said, about three other 
people that you appointed as Chairperson to this board.  
The other people also had some commendable summaries 
of their work history and their qualifications.  Mr Mantsha 
does not seem to have been – and I mean no discredit to 
Mr Mantsha at all, all I am saying is, Mr Mantsha does not 
seem to have had anything to an objective outside view 
that made him stand head or shoulders above anybody 
10 
else, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not stand out. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He did not stand out, with respect 
that is so.  Now, what was an interesting feature about Mr 
Mantsha perhaps was that he had in fact for part of his 
legal career been struck off.  Now your affidavit suggests 
that well, that was neutral, he had been rehabilitated, as it 
were, he must have atoned for his misdemeanours because 
he was reinstated.  But that at best must be a neutral – 
some people might regard it as a serious negative, others 
20 
might take the more generous attitude that you perhaps 
adopted saying well, no, I gave him the benefit of the 
doubt, so that at best was neutral but as the learned 
Chairperson as you a moment ago, a few minutes ago, he 
said but there are countless people with totally spotless 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 235 of 296 
 
records as lawyers, why did Mr Mantsha get it, get this 
appointment?   
Now what I want to throw into the mix well in the 
question and I am sorry if it getting a bit long but I am 
trying to explain what I am really looking at.  Some people 
might look at this appointment as being problematic 
because Mr Mantsha was one of numerous applicants, Mr 
Mantsha was one of a number of legal applicants, some of 
whom made it to the board and others presumably did not. 
Mr Mantsha may be regarded in a negative light 
10 
because he was struck off – or, at best for him, that is 
neutral.  Then on top of it what we have is the evidence 
from Mr Mantsha himself who came to explain that he did 
have a relationship or friendship and business connections 
outside his board involvement at Denel with the Gupta 
family, he went to meetings with some of that family, he 
had business and personal dealing with some of their 
associates and also with Mr Duduzane Zuma. 
So would not a layperson looking at this from the 
outside and the pubic of course does follow to some 
20 
degree this sort of thing, is it not reasonable for someone 
to infer that wait a minute, perhaps the real explanation for 
Mr Mantsha being appointed as Chairperson was that he 
was not just a lawyer with a bit of a chequered past, he 
was 
a 
lawyer 
who 
also 
had 
personal 
and 
business 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 236 of 296 
 
connections with a very well-connected family and their 
business associates and perhaps the public might have 
regard to some of the other evidence that has already been 
presented before the Chairperson in this Commission 
relating to other state entities where low and behold it 
turned out that some of the directors appointed by you, Ms 
Brown, also had connections with the Guptas or their 
associates like Mr Salim Essa.   
Is it all a coincidence?  You are the person who 
took the major part of the decision to appoint Mr Mantsha 
10 
and is the sort of the conclusion that I suggested as being 
a possible conclusion not a reasonable one? 
MS BROWN:   You would like me to respond to that? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, please. 
MS BROWN:   You see, if I were to hold the narrative that - 
now I cannot see you any longer and I do like to speak to 
you while seeing you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The technicians should rectify that. 
MS BROWN:   Because I am now speaking to myself. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You are speaking to the Chairperson 
20 
primarily, Ms Brown. 
MS BROWN:   Well, also see the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am listening to you.  You also cannot 
see me? 
MS BROWN:   I can see you now, Chair. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 237 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and Mr Kennedy? 
MS BROWN:   Not at the same time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not yet. 
MS BROWN:   But I can see …[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you can hear me, Ms Brown. 
MS BROWN:   I just do not want to look at myself while I 
am talking.  I might be called narcissist as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Perhaps close your eyes then while 
you answer.   
MS BROWN:   The issue is – I am unsure, Chair, the 
10 
question Mr Kennedy raises.  You see, I do not know how 
much of what you are saying – well, I heard Mr Mantsha 
and I heard what he had to say and I saw the Gupta Leaks 
and say about Mr Mantsha but I not very sure that that can 
be said for all the boards and all the members of boards 
and of course we are dealing with Denel today and, I 
mean, some of the Denel people have gone on to do other 
fabulous things.  I mean, we even had a person who is 
today Minister.  Are these all just Gupta appointees?  And I 
mean, I read through the Fundudzi reports and the 
20 
Fundudzi report says that these people all came to my 
department and I appointed them because of – I cannot 
remember, but anyway, I appointed them. 
 
There is no way that I can make a decision on 
somebody.  I mean, I do not feel the way you do and I will 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 238 of 296 
 
never feel the way you do, Adv Kennedy, about not given 
somebody a second chance or you, Chairperson, I feel we 
should be giving people a second chance.  I feel there 
should be enough checks and balances within state owned 
companies to be able to ensure that whoever is the board 
members, whoever is the Chair, that the state owned 
companies will remain in good hands.   
Now I am sure – it comes back all the time that 
these people were linked to the Guptas and these people 
were linked to Essa and so on and they – I do not have 
10 
that orientation, I do not have an orientation that says that 
– unless they have stolen from the company they must go 
to jail.  If the Guptas have stolen from our companies they 
must go to – they must be charged, tried and go to jail. 
But I feel that – in fact I actually thought even 
though Mr Mantsha had a number of attributes that I found 
very difficult to deal with sometimes, I think he was – he 
dealt with Denel very well and I have seen some of the – 
the issue of him signing off on Denel Asia, I mean, I heard 
it in the Commission which means that oversight in my 
20 
department is also a problem, if we did not pick that up. 
So I do not feel the way you do about - how do I vet 
somebody and say you cannot belong to – or you cannot be 
friends with a, b, c and d? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Brown …[intervenes] 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 239 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   Unless I have known that a, b, c and d have 
actually stolen from the state. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Brown, what you are saying 
which you have said quite a few times about giving people 
a second chance seems to me to amount to this as well.  
You would have no problem appointing to – you would have 
had no problem, as Minister, appointing as a director of 
Denel somebody who may have previously been convicted 
of corruption or theft because you believe they must be 
given a second chance.  Is that unfair to understand your 
10 
evidence to be to that effect if one takes what you are 
saying to its logical conclusion? 
MS BROWN:   Chair, I think you have taken that logical 
conclusion already and so I am happy for you to have that 
logical conclusion from me.  I am just saying that I do feel 
that if in the course of the running of the company the 
company was fun to the ground, like I am seeing today, 
then I would have acted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but …[intervenes] 
MS BROWN:   If it was dependent on Mr Mantsha.  I had no 
20 
way of knowing that Mr Mantsha actually signed the Denel 
Asia deal because that is not right, it is the officials who – 
I mean, it is the executive who should be signing, he has 
no business to be signing that and I did not know that at 
the time.  I am talking about the things that must be done 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 240 of 296 
 
directly and whether or not a particular person – I am just 
comparing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS BROWN:   And I am just saying to you, Chair, maybe I 
have done the wrong thing to appoint Mr Mantsha.  I do not 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, you have – to your credit you 
have said that it is possible that it was wrong to appoint 
him.  You have made that point.  Now you have said – I 
have taken what you said to its logical conclusion, I am not 
10 
sure whether you meant I have already made up my mind 
…[intervenes] 
MS BROWN:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, what I want to say to you is it is 
my job to test the evidence that is being given and what I 
am doing is, test what you are saying against – among 
other things, logic, so – and I am putting it to you in order 
to be fair to you to say when you speak like this, I 
understand you to be saying in effect the following, if you 
take this to its logical conclusion and then I put it to you to 
20 
say is my understanding correct?  I am giving you a chance 
to say no, no, no, your logic is not right or you have I 
misunderstood me, that is not what I mean or to say you 
know what, Chairperson, when you put it like that, I did not 
realise, but that cannot be right, I did not realise that that 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 241 of 296 
 
is what it means, what I was thinking is the following.    
 
So it is not like I have made a decision but I am 
listening to you, when you give your evidence I test it 
against among other things logic, as my logic and I am 
giving you a chance to say no, no, no, Chairperson,  you 
have I misunderstood me or, Chairperson, I do not agree 
with your logic, here is a flaw in your logic and then I look 
at that.  You might persuade me to say no, no, no, I think 
you have a fair point.  Okay?  That is what I am doing. 
MS BROWN:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand? 
MS BROWN:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Brown, I think 
let us take the spotlight away from how you came to make 
the decision at the time.  What I would now like to ask you, 
is do you feel with the benefit of hindsight that you may 
have been duped or manipulated by perhaps people within 
your department to favour Mr Mantsha where you did not 
know him at all, they give you a CV which did not show any 
20 
problem in relation to hid being struck off, where you did 
not know at the time that he was – he had some personal 
and private business connections with Gupta members and 
associates as well as the then President’s son and you did 
not know at the time that Mr Mantsha, once he was given 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 242 of 296 
 
the reins of the Chairpersonship of the board then went 
ahead 
and 
approved 
various 
deals 
which 
you 
said, 
correctly, should be done by the executive management, 
not by directors.  Do you feel perhaps that you may have 
been manipulated or used to push forward somebody like 
Mr Mantsha? 
MS BROWN:   I do not think so, I think that I should never 
give the – I should never blame all of those people around 
me as opposed to the fact that I might not have had all the 
facts at hand.   
10 
You see, Adv Kennedy, you made a point earlier and 
you said so many people have been appointed by you – 
you make that point to me and you said so many people 
were appointed by me who were linked to the Guptas. 
Now I must tell you that I – there is not a column 
that says do you know the Guptas in the vetting process 
because I went back, I remember going back to the legal 
and governance unit and asking how do you determine 
whether somebody is corrupt or not?  Or how can you 
check that?  And they would say this and that and that and 
20 
that but nowhere can I tell you that somebody was linked 
to the Guptas.  I cannot tell you that before they are 
appointed unless I actually know them, so I am not sure if 
– I mean, I should take responsibility for every action that 
happens in my department because I was the executives 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 243 of 296 
 
authority, I was not the accounting officer but I was the 
executive authority. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you.  Does it not come 
as a matter of some concern to you that some people might 
find that there is a possible pattern that applies not only to 
Denel but other state entities that just is a remarkable 
coincidence 
or 
perhaps 
something 
more 
sinister 
that  
number of people connected to the Guptas in fact landed 
up in key positions such as Mr Mantsha at Denel and 
others in other state entities?  I accept that you have 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MS BROWN:   Well, I had one reference during – I had one 
reference during - and that was a newspaper article where 
the whole of Eskom board was linked to the Guptas and I 
called them up individually and when I got to half of them I 
did not continue because half of those connections and 
linkages were not true and so I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    So half were true, were not true? 
MS BROWN:   I cannot give you a direct answer on it.  You 
know, I can also – there is a lot of a narrative that says 
20 
that we were all – I mean, I have recalled a Gupta minister, 
remember, if you follow your logic through because it is the 
same logic that is in the public space.    
So, I mean – and that has doomed me to hell.  I will 
never get a job anywhere, I will never be able to do 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 244 of 296 
 
anything, I will never – you know and I am captured by the 
state.  So I am doomed.  I am not ready to be doomed but I 
am doomed in this country and that goes for lots of people 
whose names are connected to me. 
 
So let me say to you that if in any way I feel that I 
have done what – I mean, what you are saying, that I have 
appointed all these Gupta people – and I hope that the 
report will be fair in that we will be able to respond before 
it becomes public and I also hope that everybody would get 
a chance to say whether it is true that they were Gupta 
10 
people or not and that it is not just an assumption that is 
being made.  I cannot make that decision, I cannot make 
that assumption for anyone actually unless – like Mr 
Mantsha who said that he knew them before.  I did not 
know Mr Mantsha knew them before. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Now again I must want to 
conclude this line of questioning simply by saying this.  Do 
you not feel, though, now that you have heard the evidence 
– some of the evidence that has 
come before the 
Commission that there may have been some manipulation 
20 
of the process, perhaps not by you deliberately or even 
having any responsibility for it but the process may have 
been manipulated in a way that just happens to have 
benefited the Guptas in a major way? 
MS BROWN:   I do not know that, Sir. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 245 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MS BROWN:   You see, I do not know – I am hoping that 
the Commission will at the end of the Commission’s 
process will give us a lot more clarity. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   Because I do not know that.  If I sit where I 
am sitting now and I looked – and I am sorry that I am 
going to take just three or four minutes.  I - in Denel, it is 
one contract that did not get off the ground that was with 
the company, that has been with Denel for almost seven 
10 
years before that.  That is what I know about Denel Asia.  I 
think – and I do not want to deal with other portfolios but it 
is almost - and Eskom, which I know a lot about – it is 4% 
of a R50 billion per month for 40 years and they have been 
around I suppose, for the last ten years. 
 
But, I mean, I feel quite strongly that I really would 
like (a) a real understanding of what it cost to have this – 
what it cost the state, what it cost each state owned 
company and – ja, I do not want to continue but I do – I do 
not have a sense of it.  I see contracts in Eskom, I see one 
20 
contract in Denel that does not get off the ground, I see a 
number of contracts in Transnet that looks like it also 
going in the direction and it did not start in my time but it 
looks like it is also going to the direction that it has some 
relationship with the Guptas.  What collectively and what 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 246 of 296 
 
cumulatively has that actually meant for this country? 
 
I mean, how much did it cost the country is what I 
am saying because I do not have  - I have an overwhelming 
sense that almost every company in every one of the state 
owned companies actually either belong to somebody who 
left the company and then opened a company and it was 
largely white and I think that there was an attempt to try 
and bring in, even though they were foreign, I think so, 
that there was an attempt to try and rework the economy so 
that more black people could be participants in that 
10 
economy.   
And I have heard you, Adv Kennedy, on this matter.  
I think it is quite a serious matter but I think there is that 
also that we need to – and I am hoping one day that there 
will be another study that actually shows the effects of the 
Guptas in the full economy or the full economy as it counts 
for state owned companies.  I am sorry that I took a bit of 
time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, may I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I appreciate that you will not have 
followed all of the evidence that has been led in this 
Commission on these various state entities including 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 247 of 296 
 
Denel.  I am not going to take you through all of the 
evidence 
that 
has 
already 
been 
presented 
to 
the 
Chairperson in earlier sessions where in fact focus was put 
on not just the Denel Asia contract which ultimately was 
not brought into effect, as you have pointed out but other 
contracts which in fact involved very substantial amounts 
that Denel granted to VR Laser particularly the platform 
hulls contract and the Denel Land Systems acquisition.  
That the Chairperson has already heard evidence on and I 
want to suggest to you that your indication that the cost of 
10 
what may have been inappropriate, may not have been that 
much, is perhaps a serious understatement. 
MS BROWN:   No, no, I am not saying it was not that 
much.  I think any corruption in any – it does not matter if 
it is one cent, is important for us to look at. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
MS BROWN:   I do not want to misrepresented by – in – by 
myself maybe or I misunderstood in the Commission. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you for that clarification.  
When you did discover in June 2015 of Mr Mantsha’s more 
20 
chequered history as an attorney who had been struck off, 
did it not occur to you at that stage to say to cabinet just a 
month ago cabinet approved the appointment or the 
appointment took effect just a month ago of Mr Mantsha 
have now discovered something else about him, perhaps 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 248 of 296 
 
we should reconsider the appointment, perhaps others 
within cabinet may take a less generous view of giving 
people a second chance.  Did that occur to you at all? 
MS BROWN:   Well, it was not a convention cabinet but I 
might – I could have done that, you are right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, right, but did it occur. 
MS BROWN:   It was not a convention for anyone to be 
able to just walk into cabinet and put up their hands and 
say I have made a mistake on this or that and – and so but 
– I mean, if – I could have done that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I do not think Mr Kennedy means 
that you should have brought it to cabinet in that way.  You 
could have brought it an acceptable – in the usual way in 
which matters that members of the cabinet wish to be 
discussed at cabinet put it, so there must be – I am sure 
there is a way how you make sure that a certain matter will 
be discussed so you could have – I do not know whether 
your write a memo and get it approved by the President 
that it can go to cabinet but it could have been done in a 
way other than the one you described, is it not? 
20 
MS BROWN:   I did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I ask you another question, you will 
remember that earlier on Mr Kennedy referred to the 
member of the 2015 board who had come from the previous 
board, I think it was Mr Motseke or – Motseke I think who 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 249 of 296 
 
was retained.  You remember that part of – that discussion 
earlier. 
MS BROWN:   I remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think some or other witness has 
indicated before this Commission that the reason why Mr 
Motseke was retained and continued under the 2015 board 
to be a member of the board for the sake of continuity, 
would that accord with what you would expect, namely that 
there should be one or more members of the one board, 
the outgoing board who remain to be part of the new board 
10 
so as to ensure continuity? 
MS BROWN:  I think that sort of is where I learnt, I learnt 
it in the department.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  That I have one or two members remaining 
for continuity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you know what criteria may have 
been used to choose Mr Motseke out of all the pre-2015 
board members to be the one who would continue under 
the 2015 board? 
20 
MS BROWN:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MS BROWN:  I cannot even remember what Mr Motseke 
looks like.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 250 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  So I do not really remember it.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Do 
you 
remember 
whether 
in 
the 
department ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  But I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a set of criteria for choosing 
members who would continue in the next board, when the 
board in which they had served, its term ended.  Do you 
know whether there was a set of criteria to say we must 
look for somebody who meets this criteria? 
MS BROWN:  You know Chair, there is an assessment that 
10 
is done, and maybe your investigator should get the 
assessment of the 2014 ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Board.  
MS BROWN:  Denel board.  Because I cannot remember 
the detail of it, but there is an assessment done.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  And look, it is not always listed all the 
details on the assessment because some things are just 
personal horrible things that I do not think needs to be said 
about people.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
But 
I 
would 
imagine 
that 
if 
an 
assessment is made, then its aim must be to get somebody 
who is likely to make a meaningful contribution at least in 
the new board.  
MS BROWN:  I think so. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 251 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  I think you are right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think the Fendudzi report says Mr 
Motseke also had some association with the Guptas.  I 
cannot remember the details.  When they say something 
else, if I am not mistaken or some other witness said 
something else, not so kind about him.   
 
But suggesting that there must have been other 
board members who were much more qualified or suitable 
to be, to continue.  But you say there were assessments 
10 
that the department used to make and those assessments 
may well have been used to ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS BROWN:  I think that could be one way of the 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS BROWN:  And could be one reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Brown, 
20 
may we now move to a couple of pages of the Fundudzi 
report.   
MS BROWN:  I wonder Chair, if it is possible just to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  A short break? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 252 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  I want to take a comfort break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  For just two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS BROWN:  So it does not have to be long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine.  It is ten to eight, let 
us give it ten minutes.  We resume at eight. 
MS BROWN:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  
MS BROWN:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Brown, can I take you in the same 
bundle to page 746?  That is the first title page of the 
Fundudzi report.   
MS BROWN:  Yes, I am there.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now in the body of the Fundudzi 
report, we have included only extracts that were relevant 
20 
to Denel, and there is a discussion from page 748.  You 
have that?   
MS BROWN:  I am there.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  From paragraph 14.3 they deal with 
the process that was followed in the appointments of 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 253 of 296 
 
various state entities, including Denel appointments made 
by you or at least approved by you and they deal 
particularly with the use of the info port email address that 
you have already dealt with.  
 
For example at page 754 and effectively what they 
have provided by way of this report, is evidence that this 
info port email was indeed connected to Gupta associates 
and that email address sent a number of nominations to Ms 
Davids, your PA at the time.  
 
Nominations for appointment to the Denel board.  
10 
You were not aware of that at that stage, is that correct?   
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You cannot deny that it was, you 
cannot deny that it was used, but you say you were not 
aware of that at that stage.  
MS BROWN:  No, I was not aware of it.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Yes, 
and 
if 
I 
can 
now 
take 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes?  Carry on, carry on.  Did you 
20 
want to add something? 
MS BROWN:  No, no I do not.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  If I can now take you to some 
of the emails, if I might just have a moment Chair.  If I can 
take you please to page 780. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 254 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  780? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  That is correct.  
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You will see that the very top address 
section, refers to an email being sent from Kimberley 
Davids at her Gmail address, to Kim Davids at the DPE.gov 
address.  So she was presumably forwarding to her other 
email, the email concerned. 
MS BROWN:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now the next email is what interests 
10 
me.  The forwarded message that she forwarded to her 
other official email address, comes from somebody rather 
enigmatically titled business man and here we see that the 
email address is the infoportal1@zoho.com address that 
we have just dealt with. 
MS BROWN:  I see that.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was sent on the 6 t h of March 2015.  
The subject is Denel.  That was sent from this info portal 
email address that Fundudzi established was linked to the 
Guptas or their associates.  It was addressed to Kimberley 
20 
Davids at her gmail.com address which presumably was 
her private address and she then forwarded as we have 
seen at the top, this very message to herself at the 
departmental email. 
 
The list is then given with two columns that then 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 255 of 296 
 
follows under two headings, gender and member and that 
is the list of individuals proposed for appointment to the 
board with Mr Mantsha as Chairman, Tami Motsumi, 
Johannes Motseke. 
 
Johannes Motseke of course we have already seen 
is the individual who survived the transition from the old 
board to the new.  Remember that? 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then Jan Shake, somebody called 
Pierre.  There is no surname given.  Then Mr Johame, I 
10 
apologise if I am mangling the pronunciation, Mahuma 
Pelo, Silence Ntshaveni, Pinkie Mahlangu, Visham Naidoo, 
Mpho Gomogwe and General Vusi Nkabinde.  
 
You see that? 
MS BROWN:  I see that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then it says: 
 
“Hi.  Here is madam’s recommendation.” 
 
She does not say who madam is: 
 
“You have most CV’s, just missing Jan Shake 
which I will provide tomorrow.  Attached for 
20 
Mpho, Pinkie, General, Silence and Toyami.” 
 
And then there is a final line which says: 
 
“You have CA/auditor/legal/policy/IT defence 
tech incumbent army defence.  So a solid mix 
of skills.” 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 256 of 296 
 
 
That is what this unnamed author of this email 
indicates.  Now there was a suggestion in the Fundudzi 
report that the person named as Pierre without his 
surname, was somebody who you had recommended, that 
the madam referred to in that paragraph just under the list, 
that he was your recommendation.   
 
The report indicates, I do not think I need to take 
you to it, indicates that you conveyed to the Fundudzi 
investigators or at least responded to their report, that you 
did not know who this Pierre was and you had not 
10 
recommended him.  
 
Is that correct? 
MS BROWN:  Well, I had a general position of not 
recommending people.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  There were lots of people that I would have 
liked to have passed the vetting process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  Because I knew that they, because many 
ministers tell me that can so and so apply and so and so 
20 
apply, and I say yes, they can. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sure.  
MS BROWN:  And so they apply, but I before the Fundudzi 
report, I have not seen this report.  But I also must say 
that I think there are names here who if they just now as I 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 257 of 296 
 
was preparing, not because I have a wonderful memory 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  But some of these names are present and 
some did not make it.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, I am going to go into that in a 
moment, if you could just indulge me with answering the 
question that I was posing to you.   
MS BROWN:  Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It was specifically relating to a person 
10 
referred to only by his first name of Pierre.  You did not 
recommend him. 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct?   
MS BROWN:  No, I really ... no, I would not have 
recommended anybody. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, well I ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I feel that everybody should go through the 
process of apply. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, well then perhaps answer this Ms 
20 
Brown.  Do you know who the Pierre is that is referred to 
here? 
MS BROWN:  Did you know ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I am not sure.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well ...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 258 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  I know two Pierre’s.  I do not know if I 
...[intervenes]  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Do 
you 
know 
if 
either 
of 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I know two Pierre’s. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Do you know if either of them applied 
for a position on the Denel board? 
MS BROWN:  I know two Pierre’s and they could have 
asked me.  I do not know.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You do not know if they applied.  
10 
Thank you. 
MS BROWN:  But I do not think they would have applied at 
all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Okay, now so as far as you are 
concerned, you cannot clarify who this Pierre is.  But it 
certainly was not somebody who you were recommending 
to yourself, to appoint. Is that fair? 
MS BROWN:  No, the fact is that whoever wants to join the 
Denel board must apply. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
20 
MS BROWN:  That, it would be unfair for me to say I want 
so and so ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Brown, if you just indulge me.  I 
am not asking you if it would have been fair for you to have 
nominated somebody.  I have asked you a very simple and 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 259 of 296 
 
confined question.  Did you recommend anybody by the 
name of Pierre for appointments to the board? 
MS BROWN:  No.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Alright, well let us then 
go to the exercise that you were suggesting we look at a 
moment ago, which is when we look at all of the names, so 
this email we know came from somebody who did not 
attach his or her name to this enigmatic title businessman 
from info portal that Fundudzi have evidence, was linked to 
Gupta associates.  
10 
 
The list here says a number of names who include 
Mr Mantsha, the first one as Chairman.  He in fact was 
approved.  We know that, correct? 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thami Mosumi was also appointed by 
you, correct? 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Johannes Motseki was the person 
who was on the previous board and who was then re-
appointed by you, correct? 
20 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Jan Shake is the name that is put 
forward in this list.  You did not appoint him, correct? 
MS BROWN:  The way you are asking the questions, is I 
get the list of people and I appoint whoever is on that list.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 260 of 296 
 
I make the decision from that list.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  And I make it in consultation with my 
department.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But Ms Brown, I am sorry to interrupt 
but really time is precious particularly in a commission that 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I know, but I cannot allow ... you know sir, I 
cannot allow you to say you appointed this person correct 
and then I have to just say yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I mean I would like to, but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Brown, if of course you know 
that you did not appoint him you can say yes I did not 
appoint him or no, I did not appoint him.  If you cannot 
remember whether you did or you did not, you can say I 
cannot remember.  
 
So there is a way of giving a short answer, but 
based on the ... on what you have just said, do you mean 
that your department would bring you the exact number of 
20 
names required for appointment and you would then 
appoint those people.  
 
Or is the position that they would give you more 
names than you needed to appoint and you would choose 
from those? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 261 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  They would present it to me with the, with a 
number of people around the table and we will discuss the 
names and from those names, I would then ... from the 
discussion we will make the further short list and then I do 
appoint at the end, where I approve, after it is looked by 
legal, by governance, by the units and whoever else is on 
the list.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  So yes, in that respect yes I approve it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the answer is you do, you used to be 
10 
given a longer list of names than you needed to appoint.  
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
through 
discussion 
with 
your 
department a short list would be, would emerge and that is 
the list that you would, that is the list of people that you 
would appoint.  Is that right? 
MS BROWN:  That is right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But can you remember or you cannot 
remember whether you appointed Jan Shake? 
MS BROWN:  I do not think we appointed Jan Shake, 
20 
whoever he is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS BROWN:  Or Pierre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
MS BROWN:   I do not think we appointed him. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 262 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope that has helped Mr Kennedy. 
MS BROWN:  I cannot remember, but I think I do not 
remember a Jan Shake.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright, thank you.  If I may continue 
Chair?  If I can just try and help you Ms Brown just to 
make this perhaps a little simpler.  When I interrupted you 
earlier to try and keep you to a particular question I asked 
then, you were in the process of saying some names on 
this list, at page 780 did not make it.  
10 
 
I am agreeing with you.  I am not trying to trick you 
or to disagree with you at all.  If I can just get to the 
bottom line.  Of this list of, what is it?  It is 11 names.  
Three did not make it.  In other words they are not the 
names that you approved and put up to cabinet for its 
approval.  
 
If I can help you the names are Jan Shake, Pierre 
and Visham Naidoo, but all of the other names, the other 
eight, were appointed to the new board.  Now do you 
confirm that or can you not remember or what?   
20 
MS BROWN:  I am absolutely sure, because I remember 
that ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You are sure of what? 
MS BROWN:  There was a fellow, I am absolutely ... if that 
is what has been found.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 263 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  I cannot remember the board people’s 
names.  But if that is it, I agree with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Exactly and I am not going to waste 
your time or the commission’s time to take you to compare 
this list with the list that went to cabinet, that was the final 
list that were appointed.  Now so eight out of the 11, that 
were on this list that came from the info portal email 
address to Davids, from outside the department to  inside 
the department into your PA’s email, which she then shared 
10 
with her departmental email, represents a list that came 
from someone who Fundudzi alleges was a Gupta linked 
associate. 
 
In effect saying this is the list of people to be 
appointed, and of those 11 eight succeeded.  Now does 
that trouble you?  You would not have been aware at the 
time, according to your evidence earlier.  
MS BROWN:  Retrospectively it does trouble me.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, that is what I am asking you to 
do.  Because I accept that you, you indicated earlier that 
20 
you were not aware it had came from this info portal email 
address or that that was linked to the Guptas.  It in fact 
came from a Gupta associate, but with the, with hindsight 
you say it does trouble you.  
 
In what sense?   
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 264 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:  It troubles me that I ... that almost every, 
that eight of 11 people have come from this list. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  That came from outside.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  So how does this list get into, this list still 
has to go ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  To go through a vetting process.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, indeed.  
10 
MS BROWN:  So and it did.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  
MS BROWN:  And both an internal and external vetting 
process.  Somewhere along the line, I remember that 
Mapelo fellow fell out for some reason.  I think I even 
asked him to leave, and somebody quite early on had an 
international study opportunity.  
 
I do not know who it was, but it was a woman.  I 
cannot remember who it was and I recommended that she 
go ahead and do that.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now Fundudzi have also 
provided evidence in their report backed up by numerous 
annexures, to the effect that the same info portal address 
was used for various other communications and that legal 
and governance may also have received some of those 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 265 of 296 
 
emails.  
 
Presumably you do not know about that, correct?   
MS BROWN:  I do not know.  I do not know about it.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, one second.  Ms Brown, Mr 
Kennedy asked you in what way this troubled you and your 
answer 
was 
if 
I 
understood 
you 
correctly, 
that 
you 
appointed ... what troubled you was that you appointed 
eight people from outside.  
 
Now I am not sure whether that should trouble you, 
10 
but I would have imagined that what should have troubled 
you is that somebody outside of the department, seems to 
have compiled a list, a substantial list of names that he or 
she thought should be, of people that should be appointed 
to the board of Denel.  
 
Out of that 11, all eight or the other eight all got in, 
or got appointed from one source, as opposed to people 
coming from different sources.  Would you, do you not 
agree that that should be, that is what should trouble you?   
MS BROWN:  But I did state it is from, I should have said it 
20 
is from a list that came from outside.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  One list.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  I did say that or I meant that.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 266 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think you may have meant that.  
MS BROWN:  I just so wish I knew what the emails were 
before the ones that had just been taken out.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you see the impression I get and 
I just want you to comment on this, whether you share the 
same impression or whether you think that is justification 
for the impression.  The impression I get and that is part of 
what concerns me.  
 
Is that it looks like there is somebody out, there 
was somebody from outside of Denel who was basically 
10 
deciding what was good for Denel, and in terms of which 
people should vote into the board of Denel and not just 
sending one name or two names, sending what I would 
imagine would be the majority.  I do not, I cannot 
remember how many board members Denel had under the 
2015 board, but I would imagine that eight is probably the 
majority.  
 
So that is my concern as to was there somebody 
outside of Denel who was determining that and rightly or 
wrongly, maybe no I should not say rightly or wrongly, but 
20 
he was or she was succeeding, because she puts up or he 
puts up 11 names, eight of those people become members 
of the board of Denel.  
 
Why does he want so many people of his choice to 
be on the Denel board and how does it come about that 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 267 of 296 
 
eight of them get actually appointed?  Were there not 
other, were there not many other people who came from 
other sources?  Why is it that so many that came from him 
or her, succeeded in getting onto the board? 
 
So that is the impression I have and that is what 
concerns me.  Do you think the, do you share the 
impression or the concern or do you think there is no 
justification for it? 
MS BROWN:  Given the fact that there is a process Chair, I 
cannot ... I do not know why eight from one person 
10 
succeeds and I signed off on it.  So I cannot explain it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS BROWN:  To you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just to pick up on 
the last questioning from the Chair Ms Brown.  May I just 
ask you to focus on this particular aspect.  You have said 
earlier that there were all sorts of people applying left, 
right and centre and some, there were a few people who in 
20 
fact even asked you could they be appointed and you quite 
properly said this is how you must go about it.  
 
You do not do it through me, you go through my 
office and they must fill in the correct forms and submit 
their CV’s just like the rest of them, correct? 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 268 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And so not even a minister would 
interfere 
with 
the 
appointment, 
sorry 
the 
evaluation 
process done by the legal and the LGR.  Legal and 
governance section, correct?   
MS BROWN:  No, I will not interfere.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So presumably you would agree with 
me that if the facts show, if the Chairperson ultimately 
finds on the evidence that in fact a list was being put to 
the department via Ms Davids, your PA, to say these 11 
10 
should 
be 
appointed, 
of 
whom 
eight 
actually 
were 
appointed, would you agree that that clearly is a violation 
of proper procedures? 
 
Your legal and governance team and Ms Davis and 
anybody else within the department should not allow some 
outside entity, whether it is the Guptas or anybody else, 
from putting forward their list or their slate as it were, of 
people that they would like put on the board.  
 
Would you agree that that would be wrong?   
MS BROWN:  I agree.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I just put also this concern Ms 
Brown? 
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  When one looks at this list, one sees that 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 269 of 296 
 
Mr Mantsha is right at the top there and he, next to his 
name is written the word Chairman.  So the person who is 
sending this list, wants Mr Mantsha to be Chairperson.  We 
know that Mr Mantsha, you end up appointing him as 
Chairperson.  
 
We know that Mr Mantsha gets appointed as 
Chairperson despite the blot on his record that we talked 
about, but we are not going to go back there.  But we know 
because I think you accepted too, that Mr Mantsha did not 
stand out among the members of the board.  
10 
 
So the question is ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  Look Chair, I did not say he did not stand out 
against the members ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, then I am sorry.  Then I am sorry.  I 
thought you accepted that, but ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I did not say he did not stand out against the 
other members of the board.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, oh. 
MS BROWN:  I had more difficulty with him, post that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS BROWN:  But I mean he did stand out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He did stand out.  On what grounds do 
you say he stood out? 
MS BROWN:  I, if you just went back, maybe I just need to 
go back to his CV, Mr Mantsha’s CV. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 270 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, can I perhaps help you on that? 
MS BROWN:  I think for me it had to do with ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy will tell you the page.  
MS BROWN:  International, all of that.  His ability to do big 
deals, his ability to, he having had financial background 
and so forth.  But I mean, having said that, I have also 
acceded to you Chair, that I should have been a bit more 
cautious about the fact ... I think the thing that I was, is 
that his own ... the court, the High Court allowed Mr 
Mantsha back and that was the thing that I, that is why Mr 
10 
Mantsha was not disqualified by me personally. 
 
I did not disqualify him personally, but for the rest 
of it I must say that we actually took, we actually took this 
in 
discussion 
form, 
like 
we 
do 
with 
every 
board 
appointment.  So I do not know how this could have 
happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  Well, if you are able to 
say or in other words, is what you call his participation in 
international deals what made him stand out in your view?  
MS BROWN:  Not just that.  I remember only that for now.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You remember ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  But I think he also participated in stuff at 
Eskom.  He had some knowledge of state owned companies 
and I read it somewhere as well, and I just cannot see it on 
my desk here.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 271 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I help you Ms Brown?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, Mr Kennedy will help you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I help you?  I think you may be 
referring to the summary of his background at page 769.  
We looked at that earlier.  
MS BROWN:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  769.   
MS BROWN:  So that was 769. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  I, yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  5.4.1. 
MS BROWN:  I have, especially for the state owned 
companies, I used to be finance MC.  So I know that I do 
have a, have years in corporate finance, transactional 
advising, business management, commercial law, media 
and 
communication. 
 
He 
has 
participated 
in 
major 
transactions, such as advising the City of Johannesburg, 
Corporate Diversion of Iscom as well as transaction 
advisor to the National Department of Labour on procuring 
of, deponent of IT systems.  I wanted somebody, the Chair 
20 
should be somebody with vision and big picture, and with 
elements like this so that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS BROWN:   So that would have been my reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been what made him 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 272 of 296 
 
stand out to you? 
MS BROWN:   To me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall whether it is just what was 
written here or in his CV ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I think it was in his CV, because I read all 
their CV’s. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Only 
or 
whether 
there 
was 
any 
investigation to check whether what was said in the CV 
was correct or there was not that kind of exercise or was 
there?  
10 
MS BROWN:   No, Chair, there is that kind of an 
investigation, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, as part of the vetting? 
MS BROWN:   That is part of the vetting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS BROWN:   That is part of the vetting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair, but of course, not 
only did he stand out in your view, as somebody who might 
make 
a 
good 
Chairperson 
because 
of 
his 
diverse 
20 
background, but of course significantly he was also 
identified as the proposed Chairperson in the list that came 
from this info portal address, correct? 
MS BROWN:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 273 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I see that this does not say anything 
about any experience he might have had of chairing Boards 
of big companies or anything like that.  But you say, it did 
contain things that appealed to you to say this is somebody 
who could lead the Board? 
MS BROWN:   But Chair in our adverts I can remember 
this, because I remember asking, should we not be putting 
in the adverts the fact that the person should have Chaired 
a Board before and it was a very big discussion in my 
department, where they say, not everybody had access to 
10 
be allowed to Chair a Board, and I think I conceded on 
that, but I think that was one of my questions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Kennedy.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you suggesting it is a mere 
coincidence, then that you thought Mr Mantsha had these 
attributes which merited his appointment, as Chairperson 
on the one hand, and that that was just a pure coincidence 
with the fact that the email that came from apparently, 
Gupta associates recommended the same appointee as 
Chairperson? 
20 
MS BROWN:   I do not know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well were you influenced by the list? 
MS BROWN:   Maybe quietly I was - I do not know.  I 
cannot, I cannot, say…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well…[intervene] 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 274 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   I cannot say what – I do remember meeting, 
Mr Mantsha in the - on the premises of Parliament when I 
was coming out, and he was walking with somebody, and 
he introduced himself to me and I was very pleased at the 
time that he was the Chair but I have nothing else, I mean, 
that was post his appointment. 
close his boys 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I just want to make an observation 
Ms Brown and you may wish to comment on it or you might 
not wish to comment on it. 
10 
When I see the - and that this list of names came 
from 
Businessman 
and 
remembering 
that 
there 
is 
a 
suggestion that Businessman was actually Mr Salim Essa 
or the Fundudzi Report says probably it is, Mr Salim Essa I 
am reminded of evidence that we dealt with when you were 
giving evidence in respect of the Eskom work stream.  
Of course Mr Kennedy was not there for that one, 
but you will remember that Mr Tsotsi gave evidence or you 
were 
told 
that 
he 
had 
given 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission to the effects that, in December 2014, when 
20 
the Eskom Board was 2014, when the new Eskom Board 
was appointed soon after that, he received an email from 
Mr Salim Essa in which Mr Salim Essa had prepared a list 
of members of the Board, who should fall into various 
committees of the Board.  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 275 of 296 
 
And the evidence Mr Tsotsi gave was to the fact 
that Mr Salim Essa had asked him to send that list to you, 
as his proposal and that was in December 2014.  You might 
recall in terms of that evidence that you had not responded 
to the email that Mr Tsotsi sent to you, which contained the 
composition of committees that he said, had come from Mr 
Salim Essa. 
But what he did say is that later, it might have been 
later in January 2015, when the two of you - when he was 
making 
different 
proposals 
on 
the 
composition 
of 
10 
committees, his version is that you insisted that the 
composition of committees that should be implemented 
should be a particular composition and he said that 
particular composition was the one or that of Mr Salim 
Essa has sent. 
Now, you did say that, I think you did say that you 
knew 
nothing 
about 
Salim 
Essa 
having 
sent 
any 
composition, you got an email from him, which you took to 
be a proposal from him, saying this is the composition that 
was being suggested.  But I think later on, you sent an 
20 
email where you were saying, well, there must be a 
resolution 
of 
the 
Board, 
which 
says, 
this 
is 
the 
composition, as suggested or proposed by the Board.  
So the point I am making is I am just observing 
that, whereas that is what Mr Tsotsi said under Eskom, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 276 of 296 
 
here we have somebody using an email address that is 
alleged to be associated with Mr Salim Essa sending a list 
of names to your PA of people that were being put forward 
to be appointed as members of the Denel Board and the 
majority of them get appointed and the one that was 
suggested to be the Chairperson does get appointed as 
Chairperson as well.  
So I am just saying, when I see this, I get reminded 
of that evidence, you might wish to say something, you 
might say, look, I do not have anything to say.  I am just 
10 
sharing with you what is in my – what is crossing my mind 
as I look at this, and I think it is only fair that I mention to 
you that this is what is crossing my mind.  You might say 
something about it. 
MS BROWN:   I just want to say one thing about it and that 
is that I asked Mr Tsotsi to formalise his communications 
with me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MS BROWN:   And I thank God I did because if I did not 
ask him to formalise his communication with me, I would 
20 
have to answer to questions like you are asking now Chair.  
I am not saying you are wrong in asking the question 
because it does, you know - I do not know if this is this 
portal number.  I have never seen a number like that, I do 
not know if it belongs to Mr Essa or, I do not know that. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 277 of 296 
 
I also do not know that one, my whole department, 
well not my whole department the Legal and Governance 
Unit and a very, one of the most vociferous DDG’s in my 
department.  The one who the most would come up against 
me in every single meeting on just about everything and I 
never had a problem with it, because I think people should 
be allowed to speak and that is the only way we are going 
to build this country.  
So I do not understand why they would support a 
communication like this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I just have a few 
aspects I would like to wrap up with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Brown may I take you to page 
776. 
MS BROWN:   776? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That is right.  Do you have that? 
MS BROWN:   I do.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right so this is an email from again 
20 
Kim Davids and it is addressed to – is it Humarie, I can’t 
quite read it on my copy, Botha or ...[indistinct]  
MS BROWN:   Humarie Botha and ...[indistinct]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, no who were they, Rusthon was 
...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 278 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   Can I read it for you? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes thank you. 
MS BROWN:   Rushton and it is cc’d to Annelise van Wyk 
who was my special advisor and Matietsi Mogolo who was 
the DG I think at this time, the Acting DG. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Rushton was in the Legal & 
Governance section correct? 
MS BROWN:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Botha? 
MS BROWN:   Humarie Botha was what we call a cabinet 
10 
secretary, she used to do all the cabinet documents and so 
forth. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Within the department?   
MS BROWN:   Within the – she was actually in the 
Ministry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the Ministry of Public Enterprises, 
correct? 
MS BROWN:   Of Public Enterprises yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so all four of these individuals 
were 
in-house, 
they 
were 
all 
officials 
of 
either 
the 
20 
Department or the Ministry, correct? 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As was Kim Davids, and she sent this 
email to those four on the 11 t h of May and it reads: 
“Hi All, 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 279 of 296 
 
As discussed with Minister and as per her directive 
herewith 
please 
find 
the 
S 
A 
Express 
Board 
nominations for CM.” 
And then there’s a list of nominations for the Board for S A 
Express and then she proceeds to set out a list in relation 
to Denel, correct, that’s the Denel Board, correct? 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you know what the for CM means, 
is that for Cabinet Memorandum or what?   
MS BROWN:  It could mean for Cabinet Memorandum, I 
10 
don’t know.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, but is it correct that this email 
recorded the fact that you had discussed these lists and 
had given a directive to pass on these lists to these 
departmental and ministerial officials to process? 
MS BROWN:   Advocate Kennedy I am not sure what this 
list is because I am not sure what the – this could be the 
culmination where we then at the end decide that this is 
the list of people that will be going forward, that’s how I 
read it, and that’s the list of people that will be going 
20 
forward and this is the list that I confirm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   That is what I think it could be, I am not 
sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 280 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   I am not sure. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fair enough. 
MS BROWN:   I am just giving you an option. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am not here to deal in options, 
thank you Ms Brown but I understand your answer is a 
tentative one and I accept fully that it is a long time ago.  
The list then it appears for the Denel Board has ten names 
on it, do you see that? 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the first is again Mr Daniel 
10 
Mantsha as new meaning presumably a new appointee to 
the Board, because the only person who doesn’t have new 
next to his or her name is Mr Motseti who was current and 
Mr Mantsha was then proposed as the Chair.   Now all 
eight of the – of numbers one to eight were on the list that 
had been sent the list of 11 we looked at earlier from the 
outside Infoportal email address and then two names are 
added numbers nine and ten, Ms Mokwena and Ms 
Mandindi who were both not on the Infoportal version of 
the list, do you have any comment on this?   Anything that 
20 
strikes you here whether you have comment. 
MS BROWN:   Just the comment I had previously, just the 
comment I made previously. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes thank you, not necessary to 
...[intervenes]  
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 281 of 296 
 
MS BROWN:   But I am not sure if this what – if she took 
the minutes and this is the eventual Board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   I am not sure what this is. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Perhaps this may help you if you can 
turn now to page 767. 
MS BROWN:   The cabinet memo? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That’s the cabinet memo, what seems 
to be significant firstly is that this cabinet memo that came 
from your ministry, correct?   Is that correct, it was a 
10 
cabinet memo submitted by your ministry ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   All cabinet memos come from [audio 
distorted] absolutely all cabinet memos come via the 
Ministry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes but I am asking you about this 
specifically Ms Brown, we see the emblem of the Republic 
and then it says Ministry Public Enterprises, correct, do 
you see that? 
MS BROWN:   Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what is also significant on this 
20 
page ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...what is significant also on this 
page is that it is dated 11 t h of May 2015. 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 282 of 296 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Which is the very same date which 
appeared on the email that came from Ms Davids email to 
her four colleagues, reflecting what she had – what you 
had discussed and issued by way of a directive, that we 
looked at a moment ago, do you see that? 
MS BROWN:   I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then we have set out from page 
769, can you find that please, it is the third page of this 
document. 
MS BROWN:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We have ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   Is that the – Mr Daniel Mantsha’s 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That’s right. 
MS BROWN:   Input. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That’s where his CV is summarised 
at 54.1, and so each of the individuals who were approved 
by you for appointment have their details set out from 54.1 
to 54.10 and from what I have been able to see the list of 
people here who are not only named but their CV’s are 
20 
summarised corresponds exactly with the list of ten that we 
noted in the email from Ms Davids referring to you issuing 
a directive.  Is there anything worthy of comment here that 
you would like to make? 
MS BROWN:   As I said earlier I am not sure if it isn’t a set 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 283 of 296 
 
of minutes that Ms Davids – I can’t remember if she is 
Davids or Davis, makes or if she made it out, but I think it 
could have been a set of minutes that she is sending to the 
Department that this is how it all pans out, she could have 
been the one who took the minutes, that is the point I am 
making. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and that was then carried out 
because 
we 
see 
in 
the 
cabinet 
report, 
the 
cabinet 
memorandum, sorry, that was prepared from page – the 
page that we have just looked at, that is from page 767, 
10 
that in fact carries out the very list that Ms Davids sent in 
her email, not so? 
MS BROWN:   But – yes, but what do you think it is?   I 
know I am not supposed to ask you questions Advocate 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No. 
MS BROWN:   But I am not getting the picture. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay well let me perhaps just help 
you to the extent that you may be asking for it, if one takes 
these documents at face value we have on the one hand an 
20 
email from Ms Davids, who we know was your PA, saying in 
her email that she sends this on your instructions as 
Minister, that the following ten people are to be appointed 
to the new Board of Denel, that is the one document, and 
the other document is the cabinet memorandum that is then 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 284 of 296 
 
prepared by the very officials to whom that email was 
addressed, saying to cabinet these are the ten people 
whom our minister, Minister Brown, has approved subject 
to cabinet approval.  That’s what it seems to be appearing 
from the face of these documents, unless there is anything 
that you feel you need to draw to the attention of the 
Chairperson that my summary may be incorrect, perhaps 
we can then move on. 
 
I accept that you can’t be sure exactly what Ms 
Davids was saying although one can see the words that 
10 
she used there but you can’t take it any further than what I 
have summarised, is that right Ms Brown? 
MS BROWN:   That is right. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much.  Alright, there 
are two final aspects that I would like to raise with you 
very quickly before I ask the Chair just for a moment to 
check with my learned junior if there is anything that we 
may need to add. The one is this, you indicated earlier in 
your testimony this evening Ms Brown Mr Mantsha had 
performed relatively well as Chairperson while you were 
20 
Minister, 
is 
that 
correct? 
 
Was 
that 
your 
overall 
impression? 
MS BROWN:    I think so.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You also indicated that ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I thought so and I think my department 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 285 of 296 
 
thought so too, even though I have seen the document in 
Mr Klakudi’s bundle that speaks differently but I am not 
sure what is meant there. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   But I would like to respond to it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Ms Brown I don’t have it, I am 
afraid I omitted it from the bundle here, but I don’t think 
anything should turn on that, I don’t that you are likely to 
dispute this, you made a public announcement that was 
then circulated to the media and by the media when you 
10 
appointed the new Board to Denel, after getting cabinet 
confirmation, and in that press statement do you recall that 
you said that the outgoing Board you wanted to pay tribute 
to as having performed well and having left Denel in a 
healthy state, and you commended them for that.  Do you 
recall saying that? 
MS BROWN:   Well seven years ago, I – it sounds like 
something I would say. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And in fact it is featured in 
evidence that has been given before the Chairperson, and 
20 
then you congratulated the incoming board headed by Mr 
Mantsha as the new Chairperson. 
 
There has been detailed evidence given in relation 
to Denel by numerous witnesses, some of which you may 
or may not have seen or heard or read, but some of the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 286 of 296 
 
evidence that has already been led before the learned 
Chairperson has suggested that Denel in fact underwent a 
substantial change in fortunes that the relatively healthy 
situation that applied at the end of the previous Board’s 
tenure that that underwent a dramatic change and in fact 
Denel then started to have some very serious problems 
thereafter. 
 
Now Mr Mantsha has in his evidence before the 
Chairperson here said that there were some difficulties in 
the financial performance of Denel, during the period of his 
10 
chairpersonship but he attributed that to particular deals 
that had been done wrongly, particularly by Mr Saloojee.  
Do you stand by your evidence that Mr Mantsha in fact 
performed relatively well? 
MS BROWN:   I hope you would give me about three 
minutes to respond to this, because I think it is quite an 
important comment that needs to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have got three minutes, you 
can go ahead. 
MS BROWN:   I, Chair I used to say as well that we had 
20 
one – we had R31billion worth of orders on the order book 
and I said that in 2014/2015, there was no money in Denel.  
In fact all the financial records will show that they were 
really having a rough time.  They comparatively speaking 
were speaking to other State Owned companies like say an 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 287 of 296 
 
Eskom who got a guarantee of R450billion guarantee from 
National Treasury.   Denel had a guarantee of R1.8billion 
but it was coming to an end I think around September 
2017.   
 
`So Denel has never been in good standing, I had 
great difficulty with the fact that Denel has given most of 
our IP’s away, they have a 70%, Pasad[?] Sweden have a 
70% arrangement with Denel so they own the intellectual 
property of Denel, RayMittall[?] is another one, 51%/49% 
to them, so there is a range of ways that you can look at 
10 
this, this issue, so that’s the one issue, but I say in the 
2016 AGM report which Mr Klakudi it appears to me, I say 
this AGM happens under a backdrop of a tough economic 
climate, the low levels of growth are putting strain on 
government’s commitments to stabilise the country’s debt 
as a share of the GDP, I go further to stay that in 2016 that 
I note with – the following with regards to the financial 
statement there is an unqualified audit opinion by the 
auditors, I also say year to date revenue of R8.2billion 
when compared against prior years revenue of R5.9billion, 
20 
so their revenue is higher. 
 
I say that this is the sixth consecutive year that 
Denel is reporting a profit after a decade of accumulating 
losses.  So Denel have been accumulating losses but what 
this Board did was just straightforward, some of the 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 288 of 296 
 
processes of the previous Board, some of the strategic 
ways of moving forward. 
 
I do say irregular expenditure remains high at 
R49million when compared against the R47million of the 
2014/2015 board, so there is a R2million difference but it 
is 
the 
same, 
and 
then 
of 
course 
the 
short-term 
arrangements on the funding of the LSSA acquisition and 
the risks of facilities being terminated on ...[indistinct], and 
that came from the previous Board. 
 
And of course I do make comments about that.   
10 
Then in 2017 Mr Mantsha goes on a road show with his 
Board and DPE, 26 t h and 30 t h of January in spite of the 
fact that they were unsuccessful in securing active support 
from National Treasury.  So we were now in the process of 
leading up to NASREC.   I don’t bring politics into it but I 
think that there is something to be said, but they raised in 
total R740million, and I view this of a clear confirmation 
that Denel’s business fundamentals, executive leadership 
as well – this is him writing to me, our governance regime 
is intact and investors are slowly beginning to understand. 
20 
 
So he then, one of the big problems that Denel had 
in that year was because of the politics I want to say, and I 
am also like, because of the politics leading up to 
NASREC, one of the problems Denel had was that National 
Treasury would not extend the R1.8billion, it eventually 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 289 of 296 
 
does extend it but it only extends it for four – one year and 
not for the five years that was required for investors to 
actually purchase into the company. 
 
So the company didn’t go under, I mean two days 
ago a whole unit, a whole division of Denel is not able to 
pay salaries, but the company is not going under, but the 
company  isn’t funded properly, so I actually think they 
held Denel, in my humble opinion, I think Mr Mantsha held 
Denel up quite well with his Board. 
 
I think the storyline and I would like – I would like, 
10 
and I am not sure that there are still investigators around 
the Commission, but I would really like to have a sense of 
annual financial statements against previous years and I 
have said in Eskom, because I mean contrary to what 
anybody says in the media, anywhere else, the period 
when I was Minister in Eskom we were actually – and not 
because of me – because of the Eskom family we actually 
do have ...[indistinct] for three years and in real terms e 
actually had enough energy and financially the company 
was in a much better state, but the storyline is, and I will 
20 
never be able to contest that storyline, so I still wish – or if 
I had a wish, one last wish before I am not here anymore, 
it would be that I actually get the Commission to do a 
proper assessment of the annual financial statements of all 
the companies. 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 290 of 296 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair may I raise just one other topic 
before I ask to confer with my learned junior? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Brown just from a point of detail, 
quite unrelated to what we have dealt with already, Mr 
Saloojee was the Group Chief Executive of Denel, under 
the previous Board, and he was still Group CEO until he 
was 
suspended 
and 
ultimately 
his 
employment 
was 
terminated under the new Board.   Now there has been 
10 
some evidence led before this Commission if you know one 
way or the other please just answer the question, if you 
don’t know you must just indicate you don’t know, but the 
evidence previously has suggested that the previous 
Board, prior to Mr Mantsha taking over as Chairperson, 
were recommending a reappointment of Mr Saloojee as 
Group Chief Executive.  Do you know whether that was 
correct or not? 
MS BROWN:   I don’t know. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You don’t know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The extension of his contract, you don’t 
remember? 
MS BROWN:   No, I don’t remember that.   In fact I got 
such a hiding around Brian Molefe that I am happy I 
stayed, my Department recommended we stay out it, I know 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 291 of 296 
 
Mr Saloojee’s lawyers wrote to us and the legal people in 
my department said this is operational, stay out of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:  If I just did it for every other State Owned 
company like Denel and like Eskom I would be much 
happier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The evidence that was given by Mr 
Saloojee before me was that when you were in London with 
him and Mr Mantsha, I think there was some exhibition in 
London, you had a discussion with him, I think over coffee 
10 
or something, where you also praised him for having done 
very well, either that or you may have said the reports you 
have got were that he was doing very well and that you 
said that you were going to extend his contract.   Have you 
got no recollection of that?   
 
Oh, she has frozen? 
MS BROWN:   I could have said that, I am not denying it.  I 
said I would support, but I am not the one who extends the 
contract.  I mean I merely liked Mr Saloojee, and Mr 
Saloojee comes the same history as I do, and the same 
20 
background, even though we might be a little bit different 
ages, but I – it wasn’t in my mandate, it was really between 
the Board and the Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS BROWN:   And I remember very clearly that is one of 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 292 of 296 
 
the 
issues 
I 
remember 
very 
clearly, 
that 
it 
was 
recommended to me not to get involved, it is the Board and 
the Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But when you say it was between 
him and the Board do you mean the Board was supposed to 
make 
a 
recommendation 
to 
you 
before 
you 
could 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I can’t remember, I can’t remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, but normally what is your 
recollection of what would happen if the CEO of an SOE if 
10 
his or her contract needed to be extended, do you 
remember whether the power lay with you, but the Board 
had to recommend, or whether it was really up to the 
Board, you had nothing to do with it.  I would have thought 
that it would come to you? 
MS BROWN:   I think in the end the Board would 
recommend, 
would 
not 
recommend, 
the 
Board 
would 
approve and I would – I actually can’t remember.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember. 
MS BROWN:   I really can’t remember, I’m very sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, not that is alright, it has been a 
long day.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  That completes the 
questions I have of this witness.   I have had a chance to 
discuss with my learned junior, we have no further 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 293 of 296 
 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ye. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I thank you Ms Brown for your 
evidence.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay 
alright, 
I 
just 
want 
to 
...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   Thank you Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to mention one thing Ms 
Brown before I release you, I see in that document that 
was sent, the memorandum that was sent to cabinet with 
10 
the names of the members of the Board, you don’t have to 
look at it, but you can if you wish, at page 770, I see that 
one of the candidates who were being put forward was a 
Ms Rafilwe Mokwena, it was written in the memo that she 
had obtained her LLB from the University of Natal in 1987 
and a BJuris from the University of Zululand in 1985, and 
that is the same kind of degrees that Mr Mantsha had he 
also had BJuris and LLB from the Venda University and 
then about Ms Mokwena it is said in the memo Ms 
Mokwena has directorships in Road Accident Fund and 
20 
Airports Company of South Africa, so this is a candidate 
who had experience of sitting on the Boards of some SOE’s 
and then it is said she was an Executive Director for 
Magesa Mokwena and Rafil [?] Incorporated, I assume that 
was a law firm and an alternate director at the State 
22 APRIL 2021 – DAY 380 
 
Page 294 of 296 
 
Information 
Technology 
Agency, 
SITA, 
so 
she 
had 
experience of sitting in the Board of the Road Accident 
Fund, in the Board of Airports Company South Africa, of 
course she was an executive director in Magesa Mokwena 
and Rafilwe or Rafil and she had the experience of sitting 
on the Board of or on the State Information Technology 
Agency and the memo said she brought experience and 
legal aviation and business leadership to the board. 
 
Ì would have thought that she seemed to bring quite 
a lot to the Board, I am comparing her with Mr Mantsha, 
10 
and of course she is a woman.   Is that something you 
might not have noticed at that time or is it something you 
did notice but you thought Mr Mantsha ...[intervenes]  
MS BROWN:   I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember. 
MS BROWN:   I can’t remember if I noticed that seven 
years ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS BROWN:   I mean if you look at Mr Musomi he was 
Chairperson 
of 
Inanda 
Newtown 
Housing 
Project 
for 
20 
example, I mean I think Chair it is all relative in some 
respects, that’s what I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, I agree, there is – it is not
