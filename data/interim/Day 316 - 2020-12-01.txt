Page 8 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  I just also 
point 
out 
that 
there

annexures

Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes they will fall under the same exhibit

ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Masango when did you leave 
Eskom? 
MR MASANGO:  I left Eskom November 2018. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  November 2018.  What are you 
10 
qualifications? 
MR MASANGO:  My qualification I have got National 
Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, National High Diploma 
in 
Mechanical 
Engineering, 
Masters 
in 
Project 
Management. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Masters in Project Management.  We 
see from your affidavit that you state that you were a 
Project Director for eight years for the Kusile Power 
Project. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes I started in the power station at 
20 
Hendrina 
Power 
Station. 
 
From 
there 
I 
moved 
to 
Mpumalanga Projects and then in 2007 I moved to Kusile 
as a Project Director for eight years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For eight years.  So you had people 
report – working under you and reporting to you? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 9 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:  Ja I had a lot of team of people working 
for me and the people that were reporting to me were also 
managing various contractors.  On site we had plus minus 
eighty main contractors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So you are based on your 
evidence quite a learned person but not only that also a 
leader. 
MR MASANGO:  Correct Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that is apparent for instance from 
the paragraphs in your affidavit – paragraph 2.2 which will 
10 
be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say paragraph 2.2? Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No not 2.2 Chairperson I think it is a 
different paragraph.  Ja paragraph 8 for instance – 
paragraph 8 on page 4 I beg your pardon Chairperson.  Do 
you see that Mr Masango? 
MR MASANGO:  Paragraph 8 page 4? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That you were a Project Director at 
20 
Kusile.  And Ms – one of the persons who would have 
reported to you would have been Ms Nhlanhla Kraai. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja Nhlanhla Kraai Chair was a Finance 
Manager for Kusile Project and he was reporting to me 
those that collect from the Finance Department. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 10 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your – what was the position 
you occupied at Eskom at the time of the suspensions 
namely 11 March 2015? 
MR MASANGO:  At that time I was still a Project Director 
at Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes that was going to be my next 
question.  Back in March 2015 the permanent position that 
you occupied.  Now who did you report to in that position 
Mr Masango? 
10 
MR MASANGO:  In that position Chair I was reporting to 
Dan Marokane.  Mr Marokane was responsible for all Group 
Capital Projects.  So Kusile was one the mega project that 
was reporting to Dan Marokane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now his designation it is – you could 
assist us there Group Executive what? 
MR MASANGO:  His designation at the time was Group 
Executive for Group Capital. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Group Capital.  Now we have learnt 
from 
your 
evidence 
at 
the 
Parliamentary 
Portfolio 
20 
Committee and from your affidavit that a change came 
about on the 11 March 2015 in regard to your position, in 
regard to Mr Dan Marokane’s position when you were 
appointed to act.  Can you tell the Chairperson how did 
that come about? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 11 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:  Chair on the – on the 10 March 2015 I 
was still the Project Director at Kusile.  Now the project 
needs as that from time to time we go and present to 
different committees and if you look at the threshold in the 
committee’s 
particularly 
the 
Procurement, 
Financial 
Procurement Committees they range – they range from 10 
million up to above 750 million. 
 
Now some of the committees you will find that are 
established on site.  Some are established at head office 
which is at Midrand. 
10 
 
So on that particular day there was a presentation 
though on my affidavit Chair I am very clear that I do not 
remember because there are so many submissions that get 
presented at different levels.  Some I do attend particularly 
those that go to EXCOBS Exco Business Sub-committee of 
EXCO and then you have got the Board Tender Committee.   
 
So most of the time all the submission that goes to 
EXCOB which is a sub-committee of EXCO I am required to 
attend as well as those that goes to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the committees to which you refer 
20 
when you talk about presentation those are not board 
committees they are committees under the executives? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja they are sub – they are sub-
committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not of the board or do they include 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 12 of 91 
 
board members? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja when we talk about the Board Tender 
Committee it includes the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MASANGO:  But it is not a complete board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not – ja so – because you see there 
will be a full board. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the board will establish its own 
committees. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those committees would consist of 
board members. 
MR MASANGO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that might include the CEO and the 
CFO. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who usually would be part of the board 
20 
but they are executives. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja you are quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But within management there may be 
other committees. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 13 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which have got nothing to do with the 
board.  So that is the distinction I am trying to establish 
whether 
the 
committees 
you 
are 
talking 
about 
are 
committees that are established by the executives or 
management or whether they are committees that are 
board committees. 
MR MASANGO:  Both Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR MASANGO:  The Board Tender Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MASANGO:  Is established by the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board ja. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MASANGO:  And then the EXCOBS is established by 
EXCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja then you go down you have got other 
20 
committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  Depending on the thresholds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  You may 
continue. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 14 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:  Yes.  Chair we – I went to Megawatt Park 
from Mpumalanga Kusile is situated at Emalahleni with 
them and then I – I went for the presentation.  And I must 
also point out Chair on that week or on that particular day 
my supervisor who is Dan Marokane was on leave.  So 
Matshela Koko was also reporting to Dan Marokane doing 
engineering and procurement so he was standing in for Mr 
Marokane. 
 
So I did my presentation it was during the mid-day.  
After I completed I was moving out of Megawatt Park on my 
10 
way back to the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was on the 10 March 2015. 
MR MASANGO:  On the 10 March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja.  As I was driving out of Megawatt Park 
heading to Kusile Project I receive a call from Matshela 
Koko.  He requested to meet.  I did not object to the 
meeting because Koko at the time was my senior and he 
was also standing in for my supervisor who was Dan 
Marokane. 
20 
 
So I asked him where we are going to meet.  He 
said we are going to meet at Melrose Arch.  I said I am not 
familiar with the place.  He said I will give you direction. 
 
In the car I was not alone.  I was with Sibusiso Ntuli 
who was – who was the driver.  And then… 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 15 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Sibusiso Ntuli also an Eskom 
employee or not? 
MR MASANGO:  Yes he was an Eskom employee however 
in the nature of the project there are those employees that 
we do not employ them permanent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MASANGO:  So we employ them for a particular 
duration to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MASANGO:  So by the virtue of that he is a contractor 
10 
but he is working for Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Okay. 
MR MASANGO:  So – so we drove Chair – we drove to 
Melrose Arch.  I did not know the area and then Koko was 
– Matshela Koko was giving the direction in terms of which 
road we must use, where we must off-ramp.  We off-ramp 
to Melrose Arch and then he was giving the direction until 
we arrive where he was. 
 
It was for the first time for me to arrive in that area 
but as he was explaining where – where we must meet him 
20 
I could – before we got closer to the building I could see 
him standing on a balcony.  And then he could see the car. 
 
And then we went – my driver dropped me off.  I 
took my phone.  I went up to him.  Now Chair if you look at 
Eskom – if you look at its magnitude it is not unusual to 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 16 of 91 
 
always 
have 
unplanned 
meetings 
depending 
on 
the 
circumstances and the urgency of it. 
 
 
Sometimes 
we 
do 
have 
meetings 
during 
the 
weekend depending on the pressure and all that.  So it was 
not unusual for – at the time for me if I am called to a 
meeting 
not 
to 
– 
not 
to 
respond 
to 
that 
meeting.  
Particularly if you are called by your senior. 
 
So I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you say that you had come from 
Kusile to Megawatt Park. 
10 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you were leaving Megawatt Park 
to go back you got this call. 
MR MASANGO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you – you then turned to – to go 
to where Mr Koko wanted you to go? 
MR MASANGO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Sorry Mr Masango just as you 
proceed you were explaining just before the Chairperson 
20 
asked you a question that this would not have been 
unusual to be called by your senior. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But would it also entail being called to 
a meeting outside of your offices without knowing what the 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 17 of 91 
 
purpose of the meeting was? 
MR MASANGO:  Yes Chair most of the time to get things 
go quicker we were not always rigid that the meetings must 
take place at Megawatt Park.  We will always look for the 
convenience for the convenience place.  So from that point 
of view and I must also mention Chair that prior being 
called to Melrose Arch I did see Koko in the building at 
Megawatt Park and then we greeted each other.  I focussed 
on my business then on my way out then the call came in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you had seen him at Megawatt Park? 
10 
MR MASANGO:  Yes he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MASANGO:  Prior for me going to the board room 
where I was going to make the presentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. Okay. 
MR MASANGO:  But he never mentioned any meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MASANGO:  That there is going to be a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR MASANGO:  And from time to time Chair because we 
20 
spend most of our time in projects when we come to head 
office I would not come to Megawatt Park without going for 
example to Dan Marokane’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To report. 
MR MASANGO:  As my supervisor. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 18 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   I will go in and say I am here.  This is 
what I am going to do but this is the situation at the 
project.  So that – that decency we always had it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MASANGO:  Because we do not have – most of the 
time we do not have time to interact with them because 
they are head office we are in the – on site. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay.  Yes continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, sorry, sorry Chair.  Part of – part 
10 
of my question was even if you meet at the convenient 
place would you not know that purpose of the meeting or 
would you know? 
MR MASANGO:  Well both sometimes – sometimes you 
know sometimes you do not.  For example let me say if 
Dan Marokane says Abram I am from Nelspruit going to 
Joburg where are you?  I will say maybe I am on site.   He 
say let us drink tea with the intention that he wants to get 
update without like specifying what – what is the purpose 
of the meeting.  In other instances there is – let me put it 
20 
this way they schedule meeting they always have the 
agenda.  But the meetings that are not scheduled you go 
there then you put your point forward in terms of what you 
want to discuss. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
interrupted 
you 
while 
you 
were 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 19 of 91 
 
narrating the story that you were going to the venue where 
Mr Koko had asked you to come.  You were in the car with 
Sibusiso who? 
MR MASANGO:  Sibusiso Ntuli. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ntuli – Sibusiso Ntuli and you – you had 
seen Mr Koko in a building and… 
MR MASANGO:  Standing on a balcony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a balcony. 
MR MASANGO:  Of a building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe you should continue to tell 
10 
this – ja. 
MR MASANGO:  Then I jump off the car Chair.  I went 
straight to him. I was mindful of the time because there 
were meetings that were scheduled on site.  So I wanted to 
be on site as quick as possible.  So I quickly jumped off 
the car went to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And around about what time was it of the 
day when you arrived where he was? 
MR MASANGO:  Chair I do not want to be [00:23:33] in 
terms of the time but it was – I think it was plus minus 
20 
midday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MASANGO:  Plus – before – just around about twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh after twelve? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja.  I do not want to be caught telling the 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 20 of 91 
 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. And before you proceed was it 
for – were you coming to this area Melrose Arch for the 
first time or not really? 
MR MASANGO:  Chair for me it was for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was for the first time. 
MR MASANGO:  It was for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since then have you gone back or you 
have never gone back to Melrose Arch by any chance? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja Chair between that and now you know I 
10 
– I used to then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would do that. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay and were you – you 
proceed – got out of the car and what happened? 
MR MASANGO:  Ja Chair then I went to straight to him 
with the steps and then he greeted me again.  And then – 
and then he says let us move to an office.  But as I was 
about to enter the office he asked my cell phone.  He took 
my cell phone. So I went into the – into the office without 
20 
my cell phone.  He took my cell phone and his cell phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MASANGO:  He handed them to somebody then we 
went inside a small office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now this building that – was there 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 21 of 91 
 
any name or these offices was there any name that you 
could see … 
MR MASANGO:  Chair I did not observe – I did not observe 
any name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And if you were to go back to 
the same building do you think you would be able to get to 
it or you do not think so? 
MR MASANGO:  Chair I do not think I will be able to get 
exactly there but I can be able to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was what area? 
10 
MR MASANGO:  It was around this area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
MR MASANGO:  And Chair you will see as I move on why 
even when I left I could not like pay a lot of attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  Because now I was – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MASANGO:  I was digesting what was going on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you got into the – into the 
office. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja we got into the small office.  When we 
got inside we met a gentleman and then Matshela Koko 
introduced me to the gentleman by the name of Salim 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 22 of 91 
 
Essa.  And then I greeted the gentleman but the gentleman 
did not say a word at the time.  And then Koko led the 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not even greet back? 
MR MASANGO:  Well he did greet back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR MASANGO:  He did greet back and Koko led the 
discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MASANGO:  In his discussion it was very short.  If I 
10 
recall very well Chair the meeting did not even take more 
than ten minutes to be safe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR MASANGO:  What Koko said to me – Koko used to call 
me Maki because at some stage we were neighbours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he called you Mak. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja it is like [African language] Maki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja it is Zulu, Xhosa for a neighbour. 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
20 
MR MASANGO:  So he says Maki we are going to be 
suspended. That is what he said.   
CHAIRPERSON:  He says we are going to be suspended? 
MR MASANGO:  He says we are going to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 23 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:  He says there is four executives that are 
going to be suspended I am one of them then he mentioned 
them.  He said it is Tshediso Matona, Tsholofelo Molefe, 
Dan Marokane and himself.  And then he went further and 
say after the suspension the other three will not come 
back.  He will come back.  He will return – he used the 
word return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He himself would return? 
MR MASANGO:  He himself he will return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the other three would not return? 
10 
MR MASANGO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  And then it – I was shocked and very 
confused because in terms of where I am on the site I am a 
level below where they are.  So one would not have all the 
knowledge or the understanding in terms of what is going 
on at the head office.  So I did ask a question and say, but 
why – why four executives?  And then I went further say, 
you know what is going to create chaos for Eskom.  It 
cannot be done what is the reason?  In other words I did 
20 
not believe it Chair and that is the reason for my question 
to say why – why are they going to be suspended?  What 
were the reason?  He never gave me the reason.  Instead 
he carried on with the discussion. He then addressed Essa 
– Salim Essa and say Abram Masango has got the 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 24 of 91 
 
capability to act as a Group Chief Executive.  Now it 
confused me more because in terms of the Eskom structure 
you have got Group Chief Executives, the you have got 
Executives, then you had us.  And in terms of my 
understanding – in terms of the EXCO there were other 
Executives.  Now if you mention that I got more confused 
to say but what is really going on?  And I think I ask again 
the question.  I said no but that cannot be true why four 
executives will be suspended?  And then he addressed 
Essa and say, Abram is one of the guys that can act.  In 
10 
other words he was telling Essa that I can act but he did 
not say as a Group Executive for Group Capital he says he 
can act as Group Chief Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  GCEO? 
MR MASANGO:  That – yes – the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is Matona’s position at the time. 
MR MASANGO:  That is Matona’s position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MASANGO:  And it has got me more confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MASANGO:  So – so I said look I do not understand 
what is going on.  But in my mind I do not think it will be 
good because it is just going to create more problems for 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 25 of 91 
 
me and Chair, you will remember, at that time, Eskom was 
facing a lot of problems, including load-shedding.  Things 
were not really going very well.  And Tshediso Matona was 
six-months in the position.  So things were really, really not 
going very well. 
 
So with my little understanding of things at the time, but 
this type of decision will create bigger problems than what 
we have.  And that is my beef in terms of keep on insisting 
and say but what were the reasons.  And the reason never 
came forth.  And then... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did Mr Essa say in response to the 
statement by Mr Cockerel ...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   He never ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that you were capable of acting in the 
position of Group Chief Executive? 
MR MASANGO:   He never said a word Chair on that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   He was – most of the time he was very 
quiet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   And when Koko finished that, he said:  No, 
no, no.  I am okay.  It is fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Mr Essa saying that? 
MR MASANGO:   No, no.  It is Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 26 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   Who is saying:  Okay no, the meeting is 
okay.  He says:  Mark, you know?  Everything is fine.  But as 
I – as I was standing up to leave, then Essa made a 
comment to say that - for the lack of better words Chair, he 
says:   
Abram, you guys.  You are messing up with the 
projects.  You must... 
 
For the lack of better words, he says:   
You must deal with these contractors. 
 
If, Chair, you remember very well.  At the time, there 
10 
were a lot of media articles on Eskom in terms of the claims.  
Some of the contractors were claiming an amount that is 
more than the project budget. 
 
So he says:   
No, you guys, you are messing up on the project.  
You must deal with these contractors so that you fix 
those claims. 
 
And I must say Chair.  One of the things that I did not 
do.  I did not, at the time, establish in terms of where Salim 
Essa fits in the picture.   
20 
 
So in my mind I thought maybe he is one of the officials 
that is working for the government, our shareholder.  In this 
case, which is the DPE.   
 
So that was the comment that Essa made.  I never 
responded on the comment and Koko never responded as 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 27 of 91 
 
well.   
 
Then I went out.  Then they gave me my cell phone.  
Then I went down the stairs.  He accompanied me a bit to a 
point where he – I met him when I was coming in.  Then he 
went back.  Then I went to the car. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that Mr Koko now? 
MR MASANGO:   That is Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the meeting started, did he not 
have some conversation with you before ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MASANGO:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   There was no conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And after the two left the meeting as he 
was walking you out, was there some discussion that the two 
of you had before he turned back? 
MR MASANGO:   No, there was no discussion except he 
said:  No, we will talk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MASANGO:   As I said bye-bye, he said:  No, Maki we 
20 
will talk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   Then off... off... I... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   Off one... 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 28 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And while you were at the meeting, 
was Sibusiso Ntuli in the car? 
MR MASANGO:   Sibusiso was in the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the car.  So he would have seen him 
and he would have seen him meet you and then meet 
Mr Koko to go in ...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, I am quite sure that Chair...  I never 
asked Sibusiso but I am quite sure that Sibusiso did manage 
to see him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MASANGO:   At the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On the...  But when Mr Koko walked you 
back after the meeting, would Mr Ntuli have seen him as 
well? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, if I remember very well Chair.  Once 
you park closer to the building, it is difficult to see up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MASANGO:   If you approach the building ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   ...you can see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, but once you get closer ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   ...then it becomes like really difficult to 
see. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 29 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MASANGO:   But all I am saying is that, probably when 
we were – when we were approaching, following the 
direction, Sibusiso would have seen him because I could see 
him while I was in the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Masango, but when you go back to 
10 
the car, did you gather from, in your talking from Mr Ntuli, 
whether he would have been aware that the person he saw 
was Mr Koko? 
MR MASANGO:   No, I never engaged that, except that when 
we – when I was called to Melrose Arch, I did mention to 
Sibusiso to say:  Hey, my acting boss is calling me at 
Melrose Arch. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does he know Mr Koko? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He knows him. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he knows Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just quickly back to Mr Salim Essa.  I 
see in your affidavit that he used rather a strong word. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, when he uses a very strong word Chair 
when he was saying that we must deal with the contractors. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 30 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So he used the F word? 
MR MASANGO:   He used the – he said:   
You guys, you must F the contractors.  And 
basically, fire them if they do not perform.   
 
And I must say Chair that given what was going on, 
other than the language that he used, at the time, the 
projects were in trouble.   
 
Actually, after the arrival of Dan Marokane, who was 
starting to get the grip and the grasp of the contract or 
managing the projects, getting the momentum.  But at the 
10 
beginning, it was difficult to get them going.   
 
So the positive out of that was is that, he was aware 
what is happening because some of the commercial claims 
that were put by the contractors were in the public space.   
 
Everyone was observant and will greet and understand 
that they handle(?) things.  It seems as if they are not going 
very well in these big projects. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Yes, the...  Well, these contractors 
he is referring to.  Is it companies contracting with Eskom? 
MR MASANGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And did you understand him to say, you 
should manage their contracts properly or that you should 
get rid of them? 
MR MASANGO:   Well, in my view, both.  Because the 
contracts that we have – that we had between Eskom and 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 31 of 91 
 
the contractors, from Eskom’s side were managed by us.  So 
in essence, he was saying that the contractors that are not – 
we must manage the contractors and the contractors that are 
not performing, we must get rid of them.  That is how I 
understand the conversation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Yes.  So you go back into the car.  
What did you tell your driver? 
MR MASANGO:   Well, I instructed Sibusiso, my driver, to 
say:  Let us drive slow.  Let us drive back to Mpumalanga.  I 
never told Sibusiso what happened. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the meeting? 
MR MASANGO:   In the meeting.  Because Sibusiso, you 
know, if you look at the – at the gradings, Sibusiso, the 
driver are at lower, lower, lower grade.  And so he would not, 
probably, understand because his role is to do the driving. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   But Chair what I did when I got into the 
car, I told Sibusiso that:  Let us drive back to the project.  
Then I called Dan Marokane.  Then Marokane did not 
answer. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let me ask you this, just before 
that.  At the time you hand your phone over to Mr Koko, is 
your phone on or off? 
MR MASANGO:   The phone was on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was on? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 32 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So it remained on until you 
...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   Yes, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – speakers unclear] 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.   
MR MASANGO:   So I called Dan Marokane.  I knew that Dan 
was on leave.  And Chair, Dan did not answer my call. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   I tried him.  He did not answer my call.  
And when I looked at my phone, I saw the miss-call of 
Ms Nhlanhla Kraai.   Because the reason I was supposed to 
go to Kusile was of the scheduled meetings that I had.   
 
Now the second person that I called, then it was 
Nhlanhla Kraai.  Ms Nhlanhla Kraai, my finance manager.  I 
briefly told her that:  Look, I – you could not get hold of me.  
I was in this meeting but this meeting shocked me.   
 
And because I have already missed the meetings that I 
20 
was supposed to have at Kusile with Ms Nhlanhla Kraai to 
prepare for the next meeting.   
 
The way we used to do things.  When we are going to 
have a meeting that has got to do with the finance, I will 
upfront have a meeting with the finance manager to take me 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 33 of 91 
 
through the numbers so that when we go to the meeting, 
when I address the team, I know what I am talking about.   
 
So the following day, which was the 11t h, we were 
supposed to have a meeting with the entire project team.  So 
I was going to talk about the presentation that Ms Nhlanhla 
Kraai has prepared to me to address the team.   
 
And 
the 
presentation 
was 
around 
the 
multi-price 
determination because the team contribute in terms of these 
numbers when we submit them to head office.   
 
So we were going to discuss around the presentation 
10 
before we submit it, so that each and every department in 
the project confirm their numbers and say these are the 
numbers.  They can be submitted to head office.   
 
So prior to that, I will have a meeting with the finance 
manager, sometimes with her and the team, so that at least I 
understand them better.   
 
So I did indicate to Ms Nhlanhla Kraai that I am from this 
meeting but this was a funny meeting that already – it 
shocked me.   
 
And eventually, myself and Ms Nhlanhla Kraai, we met.  
20 
I did articulate what I came across.  And I must say Chair, at 
the time I was a bit scared as well because I could not 
understand what is going on.   
 
So I related this story to Ms Nhlanhla Kraai.  I also 
asked her not to mention it because...  But I said:  Do not 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 34 of 91 
 
mention it until I meet Dan Marokane.  Dan should be able to 
give me his understanding of things because now, I still do 
not believe what I heard and I do not think it will happen.   
 
And then we met, myself and Nhlanhla.  We discussed 
that.  And then I, eventually – I am summarising Chair – 
eventually, I went to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before that. Do not summarise too 
much because in case your version is disputed, you know, by 
somebody.  So it is important that we know at least the 
important parts.  Can I take you back to when you left the 
10 
meeting at Melrose Arch?  What were your thoughts about 
what you had been told? 
MR MASANGO:   Can you repeat that question Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What were your thoughts after you – when 
you came out of this meeting and reflecting on what you had 
just been told?  Are you able to remember, as you are trying 
to make sense of it, maybe, because you said you did not 
believe that it was going to happen. 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, what was going through my mind at 
the time was the disbelief. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   To say but suspending four executives on 
critical positions, it does not make sense at all.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   And given the working relationship with 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 35 of 91 
 
Mr Dan Marokane.  He was keeping us posted as his 
subordinates, all the time.  So in my mind I thought that if it 
is not coming from Dan, I must not trust it or believe it.   
 
And that is the reason my first call was to him to want to 
go and meet him and try and understand where is he, so that 
he make sense of what I have heard.  Unfortunately, he 
could not answer my call.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In the meeting, Mr Koko had – did - had 
he said when the suspensions would occur? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, he did indicate Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   He said tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would have – which would be the 
11t h? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he said tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  When you left the meeting, had he 
said that you were going to act in a particular position after 
the suspension have had happened or he had not said that.  
20 
He simply had said to Mr Salim Essa:  You have the 
capability to act as Group Chief Executive. 
MR MASANGO:   That is what he said Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Nothing else. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 36 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was that the only position in respect 
of which he spoke about you acting? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he just mentioned that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he did not mention any other 
...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he just mentioned that as he was 
leading the conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright. 
MR MASANGO:   The only observation Chair that I observed.  
He was very nervous. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Himself? 
MR MASANGO:   Himself.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MASANGO:   Then I could not really understand 
because...  Well, I knew him but he was like very nervous 
and very worried. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of his demeanour? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, in terms of his demeanour.  And that is 
what confused me more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   To say, but what is really going on? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, well that observation is 
interesting because I think another witness who said he had 
– I think it is a she ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 37 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...had a meeting with Mr Koko and 
Mr Salim Essa on the same day who says she was told the 
same thing.  Said that although Mr Koko told – I do not know 
whether it was Mr Koko or Mr Salim Essa who spoke most of 
the time in that meeting – but although they told her that four 
executives would be suspended, she said Mr Koko did not 
seem to be concerned or worried about the fact that he 
would be suspended.   
 
But of course, what you have told me is that, although 
he said to you that he was going to be one of those to be 
10 
suspended.   
 
He said that in the end he would return to work but the 
other three executives would not return to work.  Yes, that is 
what you said. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is right.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And then, if you go back to what 
you have told Ms Kraai.  It is important that you tell us the 
20 
main features or the points that you told her in the telephone 
conversation and then at the meeting that you subsequently 
had with her. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Start with the telephone conversation, 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 38 of 91 
 
okay. 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, on the telephone I never explained a 
lot to Ms Kraai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MASANGO:   Ja, I did mention that I am from another 
meeting but the meeting was a very strange meeting.  We 
will talk when we meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   But when I met her, I did explain to her to 
say this is what happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  When you met her, was it the same 
day or the following day? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, I do not remember very well but if I 
recall very well, is that I met Ms Kraai on the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   But I stand to be corrected Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   But if it was not on the same day, probably 
it was the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The day after? 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And where did you meet, the two of 
you? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, if I recall very well.  I met 
Ms Nhlanhla on my way to ...[intervenes]  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 39 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Kusile? 
MR MASANGO:   ...to Kusile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MASANGO:   Because, on that day, that was my last 
meeting when I met Nhlanhla.  Then I drove then from there, 
I drove home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Because my ...[indistinct] was already 
messed up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. But did you meet at work?  Did you 
10 
meet ...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   No, I did not meet Nhlanhla Kraai at work.  
I met him(sic) on my way.  And there is something that says 
in my mind Chair.  I think I met him(sic) on my way, going to 
Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Because I slept in Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   And Nhlanhla was staying at Midrand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say you met her on your way.  
You mean, like, you stopped your cars on the road and had a 
chat? 
MR MASANGO:   We did. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 40 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you meet in a restaurant or 
...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   Chair, I do not remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   But he(sic) was driving from that side 
towards Joburg.  I was driving towards Mpumalanga. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MASANGO:   So if I recall very well, we met there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, on the road? 
MR MASANGO:   But Chair, again, I do not want to be tied to 
10 
that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   That is what I am trying to remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
MR MASANGO:   So Nhlanhla might have another version 
but between the day and the morning, we did meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  But you cannot remember 
where? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it was ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MASANGO:   And I do not remember the time as well 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And tell me about your conversation when 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 41 of 91 
 
you met her. 
MR MASANGO:   Well, when I met Nhlanhla, there were two 
things that we discussed.  One, we discussed what we were 
supposed to discuss at Kusile in terms of the presentation 
that we are going to submit to head office.  And then, I 
explained the story to him(sic) what happened when I left 
Megawatt Park.  And I explained to him(sic) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it a him or a her? 
MR MASANGO:   A her.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it is a her. 
10 
MR MASANGO:   It is a she. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MASANGO:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   I explained to her what happened to me 
and 
we 
went 
there 
and 
I 
explained 
what 
was 
the 
conversation and, and.  And there was another reason Chair 
that I explained to her what happened because I was 
confused and not understanding.  So I said:  You know what.  
In case something happens, at least I would have confided to 
20 
someone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you told her about your meeting at 
...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   I told her about my meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And basically what you had been told 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 42 of 91 
 
there? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, exactly what I have explained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   And she was also shocked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was shocked? 
MR MASANGO:   She was shocked when I explained that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Masango, by that time, did you know 
the name of the man Mr Koko introduced you to? 
MR MASANGO:   Well, that is the other thing Chair.  I battle 
10 
to capture it because things were happening so fast when...  
When I met Ms Kraai, I could not give Ms Kraai the full 
names of Salim Essa.   
 
But of course, as days go on, I started to want to 
understand who was that man and start to understand who is 
the guy that we really met.  What is his name and what is his 
role in the whole sphere of things.   
 
But at the time when I met Nhlanhla Kraai, I could not 
even capture the exact full name.  But Essa, I remembered 
Essa but the Salim, I could not remember.  So I could not 
20 
capture the full name as I left that building. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   And Chair, the other reason was that, the 
way the meeting was structured and the way that it ran, it 
was more of informing than ...[intervenes]  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 43 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Discussion? 
MR MASANGO:   Than a discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Because we kept to the meeting.  Then he 
led the discussion until the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is now at Melrose Arch? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So did your confiding in Ms Kraai also 
10 
involved the exact information given to you by Mr Koko that 
four executives will be suspended and these are the names 
but I will return, as Mr Koko? 
MR MASANGO:   Say it again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you outline or set out to Ms Kraai 
exactly what Mr Koko had told you, which is four executives 
will be suspended but I, Mr Koko, will return? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, I related exactly that Chair.  And I 
also related to Ms Kraai that I could not get the reason why 
they are going to be suspended. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just a way of information before we 
carry on in regard to your evidence.  Chair, the evidence of a 
witness who has already testified here, Ms Suzanne Daniels, 
relating a similar story.   
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 44 of 91 
 
 
It says” 
“When she entered the offices, she could not see a 
plaque on the outside of the office.”   
 
I 
have 
seen 
in 
your 
written 
submission 
to 
the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee that you say that there 
was no name plaque at the entrance of the office. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja.  Chair, I do not remember seeing any. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She carried on to say: 
“We were greeted by a receptionist and Koko 
instructed me to hand my mobile to the receptionist 
10 
and we proceeded to enter a mini-boardroom and 
waited for someone to join.   
And then the person joins.  That person was 
Mr Salim Essa, 
who 
introduced 
himself 
as 
the 
advisor to Minister Brown.” 
 
He was not introduced to you as the advisor to 
Minister Brown? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, he was never introduced to me as an 
advisor.  Koko introduced him with a name. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see.  Then the last thing is 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR MASANGO:   Chair, what I did not mention, which I think 
is very important.  As we – as I was going to the office, there 
was a security guy.  He was standing there.   
 
And when we entered the office, there were two ladies 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 45 of 91 
 
that were busy but I could not pay a lot of attention because 
I was following him.   
 
So that is what I could recall that there was a security 
guy and then there were two ladies that were busy there but 
I never paid attention to them because I was walking behind 
him, following him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  I think the point the Chairperson 
wanted earlier to – he referred to was that on this occasion, 
according to Ms Daniels, the person who did the talking was 
actually Mr Salim Essa.   
10 
 
And when it came to the suspensions, she looked at Mr 
Koko in shock.  However, Mr Koko appeared composed, 
according to her.  You are saying, to you he appeared 
nervous and very worried. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair.  That was my observation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   And like I said, he led the discussion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Me knowing him, I concluded that, you 
know, he is not himself.  He was very, very nervous.  And as 
20 
he was saying that to me, that they will be suspended and 
when he was saying that he will return, he was basically 
looking at Salim Essa.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MR MASANGO:   So.  And that is my – that is – that was my 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 46 of 91 
 
observation Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  How long have you 
known him by this time?  This is March 2015.  Ja, Mr Koko.  
And maybe you can explain how it came about the two of you 
called each other neighbours or Maki. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, Chair I knew Koko, I think, very well 
around 2000 and he was my neighbour.  He was, at the time, 
working at Duvha Power Station as a Boiler Engineering 
Manager.  And I started to get closer to him when I moved 
from Production to Boiler Maintenance.  So Koko was more 
10 
of a boiler specialist.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR MASANGO:   So.  And I must say Chair, at the time the 
problems that we experienced in the boilers, Duvha was 
amongst those power stations that were doing very well. So 
then I contacted Koko.  That is where I got closer to him and 
invited him and his team to come and assist the engineering 
guys at Hendrina Power Station.  Then I started to know him 
like that.  And then at some stage, of course, he moved from 
there to Gauteng. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So as neighbours, are you living – do 
you live in the same neighbourhood or are you living next 
door to each other? 
MR MASANGO:   No, no, no.  We were living in the same 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 47 of 91 
 
neighbourhood.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, in the same neighbourhood? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Now take us – you have gone back.  
Now you have crossed paths with Ms Kraai.  She is coming 
to Midrand.  You are going to – you are going back to 
Mpumalanga.  You have just been given this news in the 
meeting, you say it is a funny meeting.   
 
What happens that night?  Is there anything relative to 
this meeting that happened that night or that you are aware 
10 
of? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, nothing relevant to the meeting that 
happened during that night.  And being tired, I slept.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Marokane did not come back or 
returned your call? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, Mr Marokane did not come back on the 
same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MASANGO:   He did not return ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When did he come back? 
20 
MR MASANGO:   I think the following day Char if I remember 
very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja.  When I woke up Chair in the morning, I 
saw a lot of miss-calls on my cell phone.  And as I was 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 48 of 91 
 
listening to the voice messages, then I – know it is the 
following day, the 11t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 11t h? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of March, ja. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja.  And then there was a voice meeting to 
say that:  A-má-li-sê-lá [phonetically], please, you must come 
and meet the chairman at eight o’clock that night.  The 
Chairman was Mr Zola Tsotsi.  And, Chair, this one I do not 
remember very well but Koko called before I met Mr Zola 
10 
Tsotsi.  Now what I do not remember well, Chair, is that 
when I called prior to the following day or the following day 
in the morning but his call to me was very short, he said to 
me Maki, you are talking.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Maki, you are...? 
MR MASANGO:   You are talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was Mr Koko? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, saying to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, around about what time was it when 
he called if you are able to remember? 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Chairperson, I said I do not remember 
very well but the next relevant conversation around – just 
after Mrs Kraai. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   Which is relevant.  He called, he says, 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 49 of 91 
 
Maki, you are talking.  Actually used a Zulu word he says 
Maki uyakhuluma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which means Maki you are talking. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did you understand this to 
mean or did he explain to you what he meant? 
MR MASANGO:   I said what do you mean I am talking?  
He says uyakhuluma.  He left it there.  But now he also left 
it there, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you understand then or after what he 
10 
meant? 
MR MASANGO:   I understood later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Later? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja.  And I will talk about it. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
okay. 
 
What 
was 
your 
understanding? 
MR MASANGO:   At the time I could not be …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did not understand at the time? 
MR MASANGO:   At the time I could not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but later you did understand. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   I did understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, tell me what you understood later 
even though you will get to that point at some stage.  What 
was your understanding of what he meant when he said 
Maki, you are talking. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 50 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, after I met Mr Marokane he called 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, again. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he says uyakhuluma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Again. 
MR MASANGO:   And you had a meeting with Mr 
Marokane.  Then I started to connect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   To say it seems as if I am tracked now, 
where is my …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   Where is my – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   So that was my understanding to say oh, 
I am on the spotlight in terms of maybe my movement but I 
could not like determine how. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   But I concluded myself to say you know 
what, my movement… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have been monitored. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Ja or I am being listened to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   That is how when I say understood later 
that is what I meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. Okay, alright.  Okay, you were 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 51 of 91 
 
going to – Mr Seleka, continue? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chairperson.  So, Mr 
Masango, at the time when he says uyakhuluma did you 
simply – what is your response?  Let me not put [indistinct] 
3.09 to you.  What is your response because you do not 
understand what is he talking about so how do you respond 
to him? 
MR MASANGO:   Well, I said no.  I said no when after 
talking to Mrs Kraai when he phones, he says you are 
uyakhuluma. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   I say what do you mean, he says you are 
uyakhuluma.  Then he left me there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, you know, Ms Daniels also talks 
about after received her cell phone she made telephone 
calls and she was called and Mr Koko also told her that 
she is talking.  So that reminds what you are saying now 
reminds of her evidence as well.  Anyway, so that is the 
next day.  You say you have received missed calls, but 
there is a voice message left on your cell phone. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The voice says: 
“This is Malesela, you are being asked to meet with 
the Chairperson in the morning of the 11 t h.” 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, at eight o’clock. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 52 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the Chairperson is Mr Tsotsi, he is 
in Jo’burg so you are supposed to come from …[intervenes] 
MR MASANGO:   Then I must drive from Mpumalanga back 
to head office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what you did? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja.  There was a meeting scheduled 7 
o’clock between my colleagues and Mr Dan Marokane, 
Chair, the following day.  Though Dan was on leave we 
never questioned that because when he was on leave we 
will always ask somebody to chair the meeting and all that 
10 
because we were reporting to him.  But that meeting, I was 
going to have a teleconference with the head office guys 
and then at the head office because we were minimising 
the travelling.  So when I got that message that the 
Chairman wants to see me at eight o’clock then I decided 
to drive.  Instead of attending that meeting via telecom I 
went straight to that meeting at seven o’clock.   
The meeting was dealing with the claims in different 
projects.  I attended the meeting.  Peter Sebola chaired 
the meeting.  Peter Sebola was the executive responsible 
20 
the contract management department, all the specialists 
from contract management point of view were coming from 
that department, seconded to us.   
The meeting was scheduled to finish at eight 
o’clock, it did finish and then when it finished before eight 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 53 of 91 
 
then I walked to the Chairman’s office.  When I arrived at 
the Chairman’s office it was around shortly before eight but 
when 
I 
got 
to 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Chairman 
I 
found 
Nonkuleleko Veleti - I found Nonkuleleko Veleti Dlamini.  
Then Nonkuleleko was the finance manager responsible for 
all the projects.  Mrs Nhlanhla Kraai was reporting to Ms 
Veleti, Nonkuleleko Veleti Dlamini but seconded to the 
project.   
So while I am greeting Nonkuleleko Mr Eddie 
Mabelane arrives.  When Mr Eddie Mabelane arrives he is 
10 
carrying a folder.  The he greeted us.  While he is greeting 
us, Malesela, who was the secretary of the company, he 
comes in but he comes from the boardroom.  Then he 
requested us to follow him to the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is yourself. 
MR MASANGO:   It is myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is Ms Veleti. 
MR MASANGO:   And Eddie Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR MASANGO:   And now again, Chair, I started to think 
20 
about yesterday to say but what is going on?  And between 
the three of us we never discuss – no one mentioned that 
hey, I am having a meeting with the Chair at eight o’clock 
and all that an all that.  But the secretary comes out of the 
boardroom, he called us.  All three of us we followed him.  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 54 of 91 
 
We went into the boardroom.  When we went inside the 
boardroom there were other board members.  I do not 
remember all of them, Chair, but there were few board 
members with Mr Zola Tsotsi as the Chairman of the 
company. 
 
He greeted us, we greeted back.  Mr Zola Tsotsi 
never wasted time as well.  He then said there are found 
executives that are going to be suspended.  He mentioned 
them by names and then he mentioned two things as a 
reason why the executives are going to be suspended.   
10 
One, he says, is regarding the inquiry that they want to do 
and when they want to do that inquiry they do not want this 
executive to be at work. 
 
And then two, he also want to – the inquiry must 
cover the issue of their performance and then he says he 
is therefore requesting us to assist them and act in the 
position of the executives that are going to be suspended.  
But he asked us – after I mentioned that he asked us one 
by one and say Eddie Mabelane can you help us act here?  
Nonkuleleko Veleti, can you act on Tsholofelo Molefe’s 
20 
place?   And then he asked me to act on the Group Capital 
in Dan’s position and as he was asking us we all said look, 
Chair, we will help you.   
 
And then he said in the place of Tshediso Matuna, 
Mr Zethembe Khoza will act.  And then he said there are 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 55 of 91 
 
two meetings that are arranged.  The one, he wants to go 
and address the executives, the executive forum and then 
the second one, he must go and address the media. 
 
So by the look of things, Chair, all these things 
were already lined up because after he has addressed us 
and asked us to act then he asked us to join him.  Then we 
followed them.  We went to Franklin boardroom.  Though, 
Chair, I do not remember very well whether he started 
addressing the executives first or the media but those two 
meetings did take place. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your meeting Mr Tsotsi you say 
around about what time was it? 
MR MASANGO:   It was around about eight, eight o’clock, 
past eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And you all agreed to act in the 
positions in which …[intervenes] 
MR MASANGO:   We all agreed that we will act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MASANGO:   The only person that he did not ask, it 
was Mr Zethembe.  Now one made an assumption because 
20 
they had a meeting already before they called us in.  
Probably is already discussing with the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you say Mr Zethembe Khoza was 
at that meeting as well? 
MR MASANGO:   Mr Zethembe was in the meeting, Chair. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 56 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So at the meeting it was 
yourself, Ms Veleti, Mr Malebane? 
MR MASANGO:   Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mabelane, I am sorry. 
MR MASANGO:   Edwin Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Edwin Mabelane, Mr Khoza and Mr 
Tsotsi. 
MR MASANGO:   And Mr – and I think Venete Klein was 
also in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
MR MASANGO:   But – ja, I do not remember very well but 
Mr Khoza was in a meeting, Mr - Klein Venete was also in 
the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Masango, yes, y 
our recollection seems to come very close to what Ms 
Veleti has said in her affidavit.  So she says the next 
morning she had a meeting with Mr Koko on the 10 t h, the 
evening of the 10 t h.  So the next morning, which is the 11 t h,  
according to her, after being called to the boardroom, in 
20 
the boardroom, she says, is Mr Zola Tsotsi, Mr Zethembe 
Khoza and Ms Venete Klein were present. 
 
She also thinks Leo Dlamini was present and 
another divisional executive.  She cannot recall which one.  
Could that be Mr Edwin Mabelane? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 57 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   Well, Mr Eddie Mabelane was there, like I 
said, but from the board’s side, other than the three of us 
who went in there were few people and without us, 
probably there would be plus minus four, five, around 
there, but I do not remember the others, without the three 
of us who were called in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  No, that is fine.  There is just one 
thing I need to get clarity on from you.  According to the 
sequence of events as given by the board members, who 
10 
have come to testify, the meeting with the persons, 
yourselves, who were to be appointed to act, would have 
happened on the 12 March, according to you, the narration 
by them, because on the 11 t h the board had various 
meetings including the meeting with the Minister where the 
decision to suspend the executives was taken.  Are you 
hundred percent certain about your dates? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, I am hundred percent certain about 
the dates.  When we were asked to act, the normal 
procedure is that when somebody is going to act you call 
20 
him and you give him the delegation of authority to sign so 
that you give him powers to execute whatever decisions 
might be required.   
We were never given the delegation of authority on 
the 11 t h, though I do not remember when we were given to 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 58 of 91 
 
sign.  But on the meeting of the 11 t h we were just asked 
whether can we help and then things started to unfold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether you had another 
meeting with Mr Tsotsi on the 12 t h?  
MR MASANGO:   I do not remember, Chair.  I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, the interesting thing about the 
time that you say your meeting with Mr Tsotsi happened on 
the 11 t h, is that if it happened at about eight it would be – 
it would have been before the board or any of its 
committees had made the decision that the four executives 
10 
should be suspended.   
 
The evidence that we have heard is that there was 
the meeting of the board on the 9 March but at that board 
meeting there was no discussion of the suspensions of the 
executives and arrangements were made for the board to 
meet again on the 11 t h and on the 11 t h there was a meeting 
of the board in the morning.  I do not know if we ever 
explored the time but it was a meeting of the board in the 
morning.  Then that meeting was joined by the Minister of 
Public Enterprise so the meeting became a meeting of the 
20 
board and the Minister of Enterprises.  When she had left I 
think the meeting of board continued, if I am not mistaken, 
but at some stage in the afternoon, there was a meeting of 
the People in Governance Committee, if I recall correctly 
and that it is in that meeting that the …[intervenes] 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 59 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   P & G. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Possible …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The P & G meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   P & G meeting.  Ja, is it not People in 
Governance? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the one, Chair. 
MR MASANGO:   That is the one, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  At that meeting, it is that meeting 
that 
that 
committee 
discussed 
the 
issue 
of 
which 
executives should be appointed to act in the positions and 
10 
that meeting was happening I think after lunch, if I am not 
mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
so 
if 
the 
meeting 
between 
yourselves, the three of you and Mr Tsotsi and Mr Khoza 
happened on the 12 t h in the morning maybe it was because 
the decision to suspend had been approved or had been 
made and the decision as to which executives will act in 
the positions of the executives who would have been 
suspended had been taken but if the meeting between the 
20 
three of you and Mr Tsotsi happened at about 8 a.m. on the 
11 t h and at that meeting he asked the three of you to act 
one would wonder whether he – how he could do that 
before the board had discussed the issue unless, of 
course, he had your names in mind as the names of the 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 60 of 91 
 
people that he would suggest to the board or to the 
committee and wanted you to indicate whether in principle 
if the board approved your names you would be prepared 
to act or not.  But from what you say it looks like – does it 
look like he was saying I am asking you to act or does it 
look like he was asking you to indicate whether in principle 
if you were to be asked to act you would be prepared to 
act.  Do you know which one of the two he was pursing? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, I think – okay, let me go back a 
bit, Chair.  The date of the 10 t h and the date of the 11 t h, I 
10 
am certain about those dates in my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR MASANGO:   And like I explained, Chair, to you that 
when you are going to ask somebody to act you call him, 
you agree with him first whether he can do it or not.  But 
also I must bring it to your attention, Chair, that the ways 
things unfolded before we were called in, it seems as if the 
board 
was 
having 
a 
meeting 
because 
they 
locked 
themselves in the boardroom.  We did not even know that 
they are sitting in the boardroom because we went into the 
20 
office of the Chairman, that is where were waiting and then 
all of a sudden Malesela came from the boardroom and 
called us to the boardroom and then when we went in, we 
find that there were people in the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 61 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Chair, there is something I 
need to draw to the Chairperson’s attention, Mr Masango, 
which you yourself might not be aware of and we are 
obtaining an affidavit from this witness, Chairperson, who 
writes and email on the 11 March 2015 at 9.27 or 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the morning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the morning.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is the HR manager at Eskom.  She 
writes and say to one of the persons within industrial 
10 
relations, I think, Mr Philip Mashego, she says: 
“Please urgently give me a step-by-step process for 
the suspension of the F-Bands.” 
Now you know who are the F-Bands, Mr Masango? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, I know the F-Bands.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were the four suspended executives at 
the time. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, they all fell within that category. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In that category. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the category called? 
MR MASANGO:   It is called F-Band. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, in terms of the structure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 62 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the email says: 
“Please provide me urgently with a step-by-step 
process to suspend the F-Bands.” 
But here is something, Mr Masango, we picked up from the 
minutes of the meeting, slightly related to it.  The minutes 
of the 19 March 2015, there is a recording there or a 
caption that the people who were asked to act, if I read it: 
“The people who were acting in place of the 
suspended executives were allegedly called into a 
meeting and knew beforehand that they would be 
10 
acting and that the board was concerned about this, 
wanting to know how this happened.  They were 
apparently called into a meeting and the Acting CE 
met with them.” 
This is before you would be told that – you would be told 
formally that you were going to be appointed, I suppose.  
Does this ring a bell?  Does it remind you of any meeting? 
MR MASANGO:  Chair, that does not ring a bell to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR MASANGO:   There are only two meetings that I recall, 
20 
is the Melrose Arch on the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MASANGO:   And there is Zola Tsotsi meeting at eight 
o’clock on the 11 t h, the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course there are – there in your 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 63 of 91 
 
evidence there are certain areas where you have said you 
cannot remember clearly. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say that the fact that your 
meeting with Mr Koko and Mr Essa, that it was on the 10 t h 
and at Melrose Arch, that you are hundred percent about. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair, and the meeting on the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that you had a meeting with Mr 
Tsotsi and Mr Khoza on the morning of the 11 March. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Around about eight o’clock together with 
Ms Veleti and Mr Mabelane.  You say you are hundred 
percent sure about the date and the time, that it was 
around eight o’clock. 
MR MASANGO:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was said there you are clear 
about that. 
MR MASANGO:   I am clear, Chair, about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to clarify to me.  Mr Tsotsi, was he 
checking with you that in principle you would be prepared 
20 
to act if maybe he was still going to get the approval of the 
board or some committee or did he just say will you be 
prepared to act and you said you would be prepared and 
the whole thing ended there without knowing whether that 
was subject to anybody’s approval or whether he was 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 64 of 91 
 
asking you to act? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, he was asking us to help them by 
acting on the positions of those that are going to be 
suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, the other – Ms Veleti, her 
evidence, was it also to the effect that that meeting was on 
the 11 t h or was it that it was on another day? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Her evidence is the same, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   She said it was on the 11 t h? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the – she is saying so, she relates 
what happens on the 10 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So there is a strategy session for two 
days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On the 9 t h and on the 10 t h.  The call 
she receives from Mr Koko is on the 10 t h, the last day of 
the strategy session.  She meets with Mr Koko at – she 
20 
cannot remember, KFC or McDonalds, on the evening of 
that 10 t h.  Then she says the next day she was called into 
that meeting. The next morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 65 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, alright.  We have not had 
the evidence of Mr Mabelane, have we? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not Mr Mabelane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And not Mr Malesela Phukubje, which 
is the company secretary, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and do you have any other affidavit 
– would you have an affidavit from Mr Khoza?  Does he 
talk about it as to when this meeting may have been or 
does he not? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We do have an affidavit from Mr 
Khoza. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
you 
cannot 
remember 
what 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I cannot recall offhand whether he 
talks about him attending this meeting where the acting 
executives were asked to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I know that he denies the meeting 
alluded to in the minutes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He denies having had the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.  And Mr Tsotsi?  Does 
he admit having met the three on the 11 t h around eight 
o’clock? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 66 of 91 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   His version is on the 12 t h.   Is that the 
meeting was on the 12 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   According to his version. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  We did not talk about 
what time we are going to finish with Mr Masango. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I hope we can finish by six o’clock 
10 
depending – but you must tell me if there is a problem. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no problem at all, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We could finish even before then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are right at the end of your 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Masango, when you are in this 
meeting with the Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi and other board 
20 
members do you say to them sorry, Mr Chair, I had this 
meeting yesterday, is this meeting now having anything to 
do with what I had yesterday at Melrose Arch? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair, we did not have a lot of 
conversation with the Chairman at the time.  He asked us 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 67 of 91 
 
and then subsequent to that he says we must join him to 
the next meeting.   
Now what was going on in my mind, it was what 
happened yesterday, to say but, hang on, what is going 
on?  But remember, Chair, what happened yesterday in the 
meeting which confused me was that the Group Chief 
Executive Officer was mentioning the meeting, here we are 
on a situation.   
After Mr Zola Tsotsi has led a discussion he said 
okay, no, that is fine, join me to the next meeting.  Then 
10 
we all walked out. 
 
Now it is very tense, Chair, I must say, it was very 
tense in the meeting and then we all walked out, follow 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At this meeting in what position did he 
say you would – he wanted you to act? 
MR MASANGO:   He said I will act on Dan Marokane’s 
position which a Group Executive for Group Capital. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you have a chance at any stage 
20 
between those who acted  - let us say, for instance, 
between you and Ms Veleti, had a chance to talk about 
what experience you had at Melrose Arch? 
MR MASANGO:   Well, we never – we never spoke.  What I 
remember was that when we went to the executive forum 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 68 of 91 
 
there was a whole debate.  The executives, Eskom 
executives, they questioned the Chairman, that is Mr Zola 
Tsotsi, about why the guys are suspended and they also 
questioned him what criteria have you used to select the 
people who are going to act, so it was a very hot topic, and 
we were seated there, so that is when she responded to all 
the questions.  Chair to come direct to your question, 
myself and Ms Veledi we did talk, but our conversation was 
around what is happening in the organisation, because I 
remember very well at the time we never even you know, 
10 
we did not except Ms Veledi because her office was at 
Megawatt Park.   
We went into Ms Veledi’s office, it was myself and 
her and then we were talking amongst ourselves what is 
really happening.  Ms Veledi neither myself I never spoke 
about Melrose Arch but I did indicate to him to say you 
know what yesterday Koko did talk to me.  
That was the discussion that was happening and all 
that, but we never went into the details in terms of where, 
what did he say and all that because the whole building at 
20 
Eskom was very, very tense. In actual fact since then the 
whole week nothing was really happening there because 
people were, very you know like disturbed by the decisions 
that were made.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you, at any stage thereafter meet 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 69 of 91 
 
with Mr Salim Essa? 
MR MASANGO:   Well Chair I do not recall but what I can 
recall is that at some stage Mr Koko did ask to meet but I 
never attended those meetings with Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So when was that after his return from 
suspension? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, we talk on the phone, he asked the 
meeting but I never went, but I never know whether he asked 
the colleagues as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So what is he asking you, is he asking 
10 
you come let us meet to…[intervene] 
MR MASANGO:   No, no he was saying can we drink tea, 
coffee after work but then I never went.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And what day was that? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair I cannot, I cannot…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it long after? 
MR MASANGO:   It was long after the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   The 11 t h? 
MR MASANGO:   The guys are suspended yes and ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just to take you back, the meeting 
20 
where the executives were questioning Mr Tsotsi. Is that 
the meeting that Mr Tsotsi asked you to join him in after 
the meeting where he told you and he asked you to act. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so from the meeting that he had 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 70 of 91 
 
with you, he went to a meeting where he was meeting the 
executives? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But those executives did not - who 
attended did not include the ones who were to be 
suspended or were they…[intervene] 
MR MASANGO:   All the guys that were to be suspended 
were not part of the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  
10 
MR MASANGO:   Chair there were two meetings after the 
boardroom meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR MASANGO:   It was the meeting of the executives and 
the media.  The media was already waiting as well, he went 
and addressed the media as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you see my recollection is that on 
the evidence that I have heard at least part of the evidence 
certainly from Mr Koki, not Mr Koki, Mr Tsotsi and maybe 
Dr Ngubane but certainly Mr Tsotsi is that there was a 
20 
media briefing at some stage I understood it to be after 
lunch, I may be mistaken because by then the Board had 
made certain decisions and he was going to have that 
meeting, that media briefing to announce the decisions that 
had been taken, you understand? But on - if he had a 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 71 of 91 
 
meeting that is Mr Tsotsi with you at around 8 o’clock and 
that meeting I think you said did not take long, is that 
right? 
MR MASANGO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is you estimate of long it took, 
fifteen minutes? 
MR MASANGO:   It was less then fifteen minutes.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Less that fifteen minutes, yes and if from 
there then he went to a meeting with the executives. 
MR MASANGO:   That correct Chair that is my recollection. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from the meeting with the executives 
was your understanding that he was going to have a media 
briefing or was he going to have to attend some other, a 
board meeting or a committee meeting before the media 
briefing. You are not sure. 
MR MASANGO:   Chair what I remember is that because I 
did attend the executive forum with him and I did also join 
him when he was addressing the media. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you also joined him when he was 
addressing the media. 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, because normally the executive in 
Eskom we also get invited, we are allowed to go and sit in.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at that stage – okay I must 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 72 of 91 
 
understand this before in your normal permanent position 
were you an executive before the acting appointment 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you were an executive.   
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so you would have attended such a 
media briefing even if the story about acting had not come 
up? 
MR MASANGO:   Yes Chair, we spoke about the F-bend at 
the EXCO level and got the E-bend.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MASANGO:   I was also the E-bend.  Now when they 
call the executive forum most of the time, they call the F-
bend and the E-bend.  So I will attend the executive forum 
- the way Eskom use to do things they will first have the 
executive forum meeting then media before they go and 
brief the media they inform the executives and then they 
go to the media.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the executive forum meeting, do 
you remember how long it may have taken? 
20 
MR MASANGO:   Chair it did not take long.   
CHAIRPERSON:   An hour? 
MR MASANGO:   But the topic was around the suspension 
and I remember the executives were asking a lot of 
questions and from there he proceeded to the media 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 73 of 91 
 
briefing.  
CHAIRPERSON:   To the media briefing and you joined him 
there. 
MR MASANGO:   Yes, some of us joined him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we know based on evidence that has 
been given that on the 11 t h there were these meetings that 
I have told you about. One there was a Board meeting in 
the morning which he addressed.   
Then the Minister of Public Enterprises arrived to 
address the Board so then she came and she - Ms Brown 
10 
she addressed the Board after she had left I think the 
Board then continued and my understanding is that when 
the Minister had arrived Mr Tsotsi was the one who went to 
fetch her and bring her into the meeting.   
I am wondering whether if all of that is true you 
might not be mistaken about the date or times of the 
meetings that you are talking about one with yourself and 
the other two, Ms Veledi and Mr Mabelane and the time of 
the executive forum meeting and the time of the media 
briefing whether you might not be mistaken about the 
20 
times.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, look Chair I might not be privy to some 
of the other meetings.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MASANGO:   The other executives who were working at 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 74 of 91 
 
Megawatt Park decided there and then all that, me working in 
the project when I come to the office, the Head Office, I 
come for a specific reason then I go back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MASANGO:   So that is the reason I am saying that in 
terms of my recollection when we went into the boardroom 
it seems as if they were there.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR MASANGO:   And by the fact that the secretary came 
and fetched us it means that there was a meeting inside the 
10 
boardroom.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MASANGO:   Whether there was a meeting prior to that 
I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know.  
MR MASANGO:   But then after we went in then we went to 
the executive forum then media.  Those ones I can confirm 
because I attended other meetings that were scheduled 
during the day and the following days in terms of the Board I 
might – I do not know.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Masango that is 
an important factor to consider because we see that on the 
12 t h of March in the evidence that was led, 12 t h of March 
2015.  Well this is a media release by Eskom and the media 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 75 of 91 
 
release says the Board well it could read anything:   
“The board of Eskom has today resolved to commission 
an independent inquiry.” 
So this seems to tie in with the evidence by the Board or 
those who have been here which shows that it could have 
been after the 11 t h of March 2015 that there were this 
meetings with the executive’s forum, another meeting with or 
the media conference could have been called on the 12 t h of 
March.  I do not know whether there is a way for you to 
ascertain your chronology in regard to the 10 t h and the 11 t h.  
10 
MR MASANGO:   Yes Chair there is no way but I think from 
Eskom point of view they can be able to ascertain and go 
back if the minutes were taken in these meetings and all that 
and their schedule particularly from the secretariat point of 
view.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay for how long did you act in this 
position of Mr Dan Marokane? 
MR MASANGO:   I acted from March, I think until August. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Until August? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, the same year.    
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I heard Mr Koko at the parliamentary 
portfolio committee say you became permanently appointed 
in that position.  
MR MASANGO:   Say it again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you become permanently appointed 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 76 of 91 
 
in that position?   
MR MASANGO:   Yes, subsequent to that they brought 
Brian Molefe who came - I do not remember the date and 
then Brian was acting GCE and then eventually he was 
appointed as the group chief executive officer and then 
Brian appointed me I think around August to be permanent 
on the same position that I was acting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh I see; I cannot recall whether did 
you speak about your meeting with Mr Dan Marokane? 
MR MASANGO:   No.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have spoken about it.  So you say 
a few days later you called him, he did not answer your 
call or it went on voicemail.  He came back to you a few 
days later.  Did you have a meeting with him?  
MR MASANGO:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what does the two of you discuss 
in that meeting? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe start with him returning your 
call and arranging to meet if that is what happened.    
MR MASANGO:   Ja, when he returned my call I told him 
20 
that I was looking for him to discuss the meeting at 
Melrose Arch but he had returned my call already other 
things were already unfolding.  Then he agreed that we 
must meet.  Then he gave me time and the day if I recall 
very well it was a Saturday.  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 77 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you called or when you met? 
MR MASANGO:   No, no for the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to remember how long more 
or less after the 11 t h? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, it was the Saturday of the same 
week? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the same week? 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, then we met…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He would have returned your call when 
on the Friday or the Thursday.  
MR MASANGO:   He returned my call during the course of 
the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay alright.  
MR MASANGO:   But – and then he said look…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry Mr Masango I see in your 
affidavit you say there you agreed to meet on 14 March 
2015.  So 11, 12 and it is the 14 t h so it is three days after 
the suspension.   
20 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, it was a Saturday if I recall very well.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  
MR MASANGO:   Yes, it was a Saturday he gave me the 
time Saturday 2 o’clock, 14h00.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Where were you going to meet? 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 78 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   And then he told me that we will meet in 
Pretoria but he will give me the direction on the day of the 
meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR MASANGO:   Which he did.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The 14 t h was a Saturday.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, it was a Saturday.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was a Saturday, yes.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, then we met at a coffee shop it was 
10 
the first time I was in that coffee shop but it was a very, 
very quiet place and I could observe only old people sitting 
there drinking coffee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Old people?   
MR MASANGO:   Ja, so we met there – I must say Chair I 
had a very good relationship with Mr Marokane as my 
Supervisor and the I related the story to him to say the 
reason I was looking for you it was about Mr Matshella 
Koko calling at Melrose Arch.  Now things has overtaken 
and things and my question to him was that what is 
20 
happening why are you guys being suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you tell him about the content of 
the discussion at the Melrose Arch meeting?   
MR MASANGO:   I explained everything to him.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 79 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   I took him through everything that is 
happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and what had happened on the 11 t h.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, and I even explained to him what 
happened the following day in the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MR MASANGO:   I was like now you know I am updating 
him because even on the executive forum I updated him 
what happened, in the media what happened and all that 
on the media briefing.  And then I asked him what is his 
10 
understanding in terms of why are they suspended.  The 
response Chair that I got from him he said Abram is 
politics that is what he said to me.  I said but what do you 
mean his politics.   
He says it is political I cannot explain it.  Then I 
said to him look if that is the case then it would be difficult 
for me to go and act in your position.  Then I told him I 
said maybe I must go back and tell Mr Zola Tsotsi that I 
will not be able to act.  Dan said to me no Abram do not do 
that you know what we have been doing and I will still be 
20 
in contact with you I will talk to our colleagues to support.   
You know the programs that we were pushing you 
guys just go and push your programs and then we will take 
it from there.  And then he also advised me that from a 
Mpumalanga point of view the stability in the province Mr 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 80 of 91 
 
Marokane was responsible for that and I was doing the 
administration for him around the Mpumalanga Province.  
He said to me my advice to you is that because we are 
engaging with the MEC in Mpumalanga and the Premier 
who is then the Deputy President because these thing all 
of them are political keep on engaging them as we are 
engaging them on the political side to help us with the 
stability and then that I what he said to me two things to 
say that I must keep on engaging with the Premier and the 
MEC, two I must act he will talk to the colleagues my 
10 
colleagues at the same level so that they support me.  So 
that we deliver the program that we put in place with him.      
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Seleka.          
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Masango we are doing an 
investigation in this Commission here and part of that is 
making the others aware of what is contained in your 
affidavit.  I have given Mr Dan Marokane your affidavit with 
the view to get his version on your meeting with him and 
according to him and you can clarify this he said he did not 
get the details the content of what you discussed with you 
20 
at Melrose Arch from you.  Are you certain that you 
discussed that with him because on the basis of that he 
said he would not file an affidavit.    
MR MASANGO:   Well I did take him through what was the 
reason for my call when I left Melrose Arch and then I also 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 81 of 91 
 
briefed him on what happened on the following day, what 
happened on the executive forum, what happened on the 
media briefing.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you would have told him that I was 
called to Melrose Arch by Matshella Koko and this is what 
he said to me when I was there.  That four executives will 
be suspended and that he is going to return but not the 
three.  You would have said that to him.   
MR MASANGO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  
10 
MR MASANGO:   And lastly Chair on Dan Marokane to go 
back to your earlier question after I met Dan Marokane, 
Matshella Koko called and say [speaking in vernacular].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was this the third time he was saying 
that to you?  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, and I said to him what do you mean 
and he said ja you have met Dan Marokane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
MR MASANGO:   So I started to realise that the issues are 
very complex here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you phoned Mr Dan Marokane 
after the meeting at Melrose Arch you did not get him and 
then you phoned Ms Kraai and then he phoned and said 
you are [speaking in vernacular]. 
MR MASANGO:   Ja, but he phoned me for the third time 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 82 of 91 
 
after meeting Mr Marokane he said hey…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but the first time was when after you 
had spoken to whom? 
MR MASANGO:   To Ms Kraai.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR 
MASANGO: 
 
 
He 
asked 
me 
– 
he 
told 
me 
twice…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to…[intervene]   
MR MASANGO:   Yes, to the same conversation he said we 
are [speaking in vernacular] we are Ministers we are 
10 
[speaking in vernacular] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is now after the meeting with 
Ms Kraai or after you spoke to her on the phone? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair I cannot remember very well but it 
was, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright no that is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Mr Masango did that for a lack of 
a better word monitoring of your telephone calls continue 
20 
after Mr Koko had been suspended?  
MR MASANGO:   I cannot confirm that because even when 
he was saying I am talking I could not confirm it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  
MR MASANGO:   But I was always wondering what is 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 83 of 91 
 
happening.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you suspect that your cell phone 
might have been bugged? 
MR MASANGO:   Well I suspected to think whether it is the 
phone bugged or they following but I had that suspicion but 
I cannot confirm that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see that you conclude by your 
affidavit 
by 
saying 
that 
since 
you 
testified 
at 
the 
parliamentary 
portfolio 
committee 
you 
have 
been 
threatened and your safety compromised.  
10 
MR MASANGO:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know by who? 
MR MASANGO:   Well Chair I do not know by who but from 
time to time there were people that were following me and 
sometimes when I sit in the restaurant people will come in 
and take photos and like take photos.  Then I started to be 
careful and wherever I go I decided not to go alone.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Has that situation risen to the level 
where you needed to report it to the Police?  
MR MASANGO:   Well at some stage I did went to the 
20 
nearest to report an incident but they never opened the 
case they just wrote I think it is a OP book something.  But 
the reason I went to the Police Station there was a drone 
in my house.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   You mean above your house.  
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 84 of 91 
 
MR MASANGO:   Above the house, ja a drone above the 
house then it started worrying me and then I went to the 
Police Station and I reported it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is the position currently? 
MR MASANGO:   Say it again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is the position currently in your 
life in terms of threats and safety? 
MR MASANGO:   Well as we speak I still feel very, very 
unsafe if I speak about the issue of the drone I think it 
happened twice.  At some stage I called the Provincial 
10 
Commissioner Mr Zuma I told him that look I have this 
situation.  So till today I am still very observant in terms of 
what is happening around me.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, you left Eskom in November 2018 
you said, did you resign or were you asked to leave or was 
it a disciplinary hearing? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair I did resign I was suspended in 
2017 December, I was cleared on a disciplinary hearing an 
then a new Board came in and then I extended to work I 
think around June 2018, I worked until November then I 
20 
resigned.  Prior to my resignation the CE at the time 
wanted to suspend me and I felt that I am not prepared to 
go through what I went through but prior to my resignation 
I had already indicated to the Chairman which was Jabu 
Mabuse that look I do not think I am welcomed and so I 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 85 of 91 
 
told him my intention is that at some stage I am going to 
resign and then myself and him we had a discussion and 
then he intend to suspend me then I resigned.    
CHAIRPERSON:   So was it – who was the acting CEO or 
CO who wanted to suspend you before you resigned? 
MR MASANGO:   It was Mr Phakamani Hadebe Judge.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja, he confronted me and then I 
explained to him to say to him that the issues that you are 
raising against me are more or less the same issues that I 
10 
was suspended for and I went through the disciplinary 
process and then I realised that he is not prepared to 
listen to me.  But the time he approached me I already 
spoken to the Chairman that look Chairman I think I do not 
feel welcome and comfortable so at some stage I am going 
to resign.  Whether the Chairman told him or not I do not 
know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How long after he had – that is Mr 
Hadebe had indicated that he was going to suspend you 
did you resign was it a matter of days, a matter of weeks 
20 
or months?   
MR MASANGO:   Look Chairperson it was a matter of a 
week or two.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR MASANGO:   Ja. 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 86 of 91 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how long was it after you had told 
the Chairperson of the Board Mr Mabuse that you might 
resign? 
MR MASANGO:   Chair it was prior to that when I spoke 
to…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, months or weeks? 
MR MASANGO:   It was weeks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was weeks, okay.   
MR MASANGO:   And Chair I must maybe qualify my 
statement and the reason I went to the Chairperson was 
10 
that I confronted Mr Hadebe because there was a rumours I 
think in a form of a WhatsApp that he is talking to Mr 
Matshella 
Koko 
and 
them 
so 
that 
made 
me 
a 
bit 
uncomfortable because my relationship with Matshella 
Koko was no longer good.   
So I confronted him Phakamani Hadebe and then he 
said ja I will talk to them I will talk to Brian I have worked 
with Brian but he never commented on Matshella Koko and 
then I could pick up that his not happy the fact that I 
confronted him and subsequent to that a rumour Chair 
20 
because I cannot prove it and I cannot confirm it that when 
one of the executives was acting on Phakamani place when 
Phakamani was not there and I was supposed to reinstated 
Phakamani refused that I get reinstated and he cited the 
reason no I do not want that guy to come back.   
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 87 of 91 
 
So when I look at all these issues I realised that as 
much as me and Phakamani from a work point of view he 
appreciated what I was doing but I realised that look 
probably he has made up his mind and parallel to that 
Chair then they started a process of exiting all the 
executives I am talking to him decide we on a process that 
his going to retrench all the executives that were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In 2018?      
MR MASANGO:   Ja in 2018 and then I left on the 17 t h of 
November all the other executives were retrenched end of 
10 
December.  So we were already in that process where we 
going discussing our package he told us that there is a 
decision that all of us we must exit and I asked him I said 
on this side this is what you doing with me on this side we 
talking exit what is really going on.  Then I realised that I 
do not want to go through the same process then I decided 
to resign and then my colleagues were retrenched around 
December 2018.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright Mr Seleka.     
ADV SELEKA SC:   These are the questions we had for the 
20 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright Counsel for Mr Masango 
you 
do 
not 
have 
any, 
you 
do 
not 
intend 
any 
re-
examination? 
ADV OLDWADGU:   Mr Chair there was perhaps a slip of 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 88 of 91 
 
the tongue by my learned friend for the Commission when 
there was a suggestion that the call that was made to Dan 
Marokane was made a number of days after the incident at 
Melrose Arch but I think it was in your appreciation that 
that is not what had transpired it may simply be a mistake 
from my colleague but in fact that call had been made on 
that very same day not long after the meeting at Melrose 
Arch.  I just wanted to clarify that.      
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think my understanding was that it 
was made on the same day my understanding. 
10 
ADV OLDWADG:   That is the position and I have nothing 
further thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright, thank you very much Mr 
Masango 
for 
coming 
to 
assist 
the 
Commission 
we 
appreciate it very much.  If we need you to come back and 
assist us again on other matters or to clarify something on 
what you have told me today we will ask you again but 
thank you very much we appreciate it and thank you to 
your legal team as well that we were, they were agreeable 
to us having this evening session.  Thank you very much 
20 
you are now excused.    
MR MASANGO:   You welcome Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank you Mr Seleka and 
your team and the Commission staff for sitting till late.  
Thank you very much we are going to adjourn for the 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 89 of 91 
 
evening, and tomorrow Mr Seleka what is the latest?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair we had arranged to start at 9:30 
with a witness we also envisaged would be very, very short 
but the witness is now represented by a law firm and they 
have been in correspondence with me this afternoon 
indicating that they will seek a postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so was it going to be one witness 
who was going to be short?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, one witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the witness who would have been 
10 
in the evening before the postponements that happened 
yesterday or it was always arranged that he or she will be 
at 9:30?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes the Chairperson well…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it the one we talked about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So we originally wanted her for the 
evening 
session 
like 
Mr 
Masango 
but 
I 
gave 
the 
Chairperson a time indication…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I remember well would they be 
available – that is the witness that could take less than an 
hour.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, would they be amenable to Thursday 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 90 of 91 
 
in the morning or Friday in the morning or next week 
sometime in the morning, do you know? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you mean in so far as the 
postponement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In so far as they want a postponement.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   It might, it may have to next week 
according my reading of where we are now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I will have to ascertain I think 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja because I do not want to come in the 
morning to hear a postponement application.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And also just to sit for less than an hour 
and then I go back it would be better if I come and sit start 
with her in the morning and then once she finishes I can 
continue with another witness.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think let us postpone that and try 
agree on another time with them either this week or next 
20 
week maybe preferably in the morning ja, is that fine?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That should be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you can tell them that in the light of - 
the fact that she was going to be the only witness and they 
want a postponement I have postponed it to a date to be 
01 DECEMBER 2020 – DAY 316 
 
Page 91 of 91 
 
arranged but you will talk to them.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so for the benefit of the public there 
will be no hearing tomorrow but on Thursday and Friday 
there will be a hearing in regard money flows unit of the 
Commission concerning Estina.  We are going to adjourn 
for the evening, we adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 3 DECEMBER 2020
