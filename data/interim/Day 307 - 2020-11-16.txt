PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 16 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
We 
are 
ready 
Chair. 
 
The 
proceedings 
for 
today 
will 
be 
commenced 
with 
an 
application for the recusal of the Chair and I take it that Mr 
Sikhakhane will address you first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before he does that I think maybe he 
10 
can just place on record that they are here and they 
represent the former President and before we start with the 
– with argument I would want to read some statements that 
I told Counsel about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe he should come to the 
podium.  Somebody must just sanitise before you do Mr 
Sikhakhane. 
 
I 
just 
take 
this 
opportunity 
to 
remind 
everybody about social distancing.  There is enough space 
for 
people 
to 
leave 
quite 
some 
distance 
between 
20 
themselves.  Covid-19 is still with us.  Mr Sikhakhane. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Sikhakhane. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:    Thank you for your time.  Mr Msepe, 
Mr Sikhakhane and Mr Masugu and I are briefed by Mabusa 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307

Attorneys to appear on behalf of President Zuma who is the 
application in the recusal application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Before we start 
with the application for recusal I would like to read into the 
record a statement that I have made.  I have informed 
Counsel in chambers about it.  It is a statement to address 
the issue of personal relationship between myself and Mr 
Zuma as raised in his affidavit filed in support of his 
application for my recusal.  Copies of the statement will be 
given to Counsel and then we will proceed.  The statement 
10 
has been made following a precedent that was established 
by the Constitutional Court in the case of Dr Luyt and 
Sarfu or in the case of President Mandela versus Dr Luyt 
and Sarfu. 
 
In that case Dr Luyt had made an application for the 
recusal of the President of the Constitutional Court Justice 
Arthur 
Cheskalson 
the 
Deputy 
President 
of 
the 
Constitutional Court at that time Justice Pius Langa and 
four other Justices of the Constitutional Court and he had 
raised a number of matters on the basis of which he sought 
20 
their recusal. 
 
They prepared a statement of facts or clarification 
of certain matters and read it – or it was read into the 
record by the President of the Constitutional Court. 
 
So I have sought to follow that precedent.  The 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 5 of 160 
 
statement read: 
“Personal relationship between myself and Mr 
Zuma.   
1. It is true that Mr Zuma and I have known 
each other from the early 1990’s when I 
was still in private practice as a lawyer in 
Durban and Mr Zuma was one of the 
leaders of the African National Congress in 
KwaZulu Natal.  My interactions with Mr 
Zuma from the early 1990’s to the time of 
10 
my appointment as a Judge in 1997 were 
connected with my work as an attorney in 
my association with the ANC of which I was 
supporter. 
2. After my appointment as a Judge in 1997 
my interactions with Mr Zuma were of a 
personal nature and largely occurred when 
we met in government functions.  Our 
personal relationship has been a cordial 
one – has been a cordial and pleasant one 
20 
over 
the 
years 
but 
did 
not 
generally 
speaking 
involve 
discussions 
of 
any 
serious 
matters. 
 
This 
had 
to 
be 
so 
because we would normally interact when 
we met at the opening of Parliament or 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 6 of 160 
 
other 
government 
or 
state 
functions.  
However there were two or so occasions 
when Mr Zuma was not in government when 
he asked for a meeting with and I agreed to 
him.  I think that this would have been 
somewhere between 20-5 and 2007.  He 
was staying in a hotel in Durban and I met 
him.  There was one time when I also 
asked for a meeting with him about the 13 
or 14 years ago when he was still out of 
10 
government and I met him in his Forest 
Townhouse 
in 
Johannesburg. 
 On 
that 
occasion I wasted to raise with him a 
matter 
that 
I 
considered 
of 
public 
importance. 
3. I do not think that I had any other one on 
one meeting with Mr Zuma other than the 
ones referred to above.  I leave out one 
that 
I 
deal 
with 
under 
the 
topic 
of 
Professional Relationship.  The meetings 
20 
referred to above all happened more than 
13 years ago. 
4. As far as I recall I never had any one on 
one meeting with Mr Zuma throughout the 
period of 9 years when he was President. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 7 of 160 
 
5. When Mr Zuma’s late wife had passed on 
many years ago maybe 18 or 20 years ago 
I like many other people did go to his 
official 
residence 
as 
the 
then 
Deputy 
President to see the family. 
6. As far as I remember I have been to Mr 
Zuma’s residence referred to above on the 
limited occasions mentioned.  However I 
may have been to his Durban residence 
once. 
10 
7. Although Mr Zuma and I have a cordial 
relationship 
and 
have 
over 
the 
years 
interacted 
with 
each 
other 
pleasantly 
wherever we met mostly in government 
functions Mr Zuma’s statement that we are 
friends is not accurate.  In this regard I 
highlight the following: 
a.  Mr Zuma has never been to any of the 
houses in which I have lived with my 
family since the early 1990’s and I have 
20 
never invited him.  He only met my wife 
at the opening of Parliament or other 
government function.  He has also never 
been to any of the places in Gauteng in 
which I have lived over the past 23 or 24 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 8 of 160 
 
years since my appointment as a Judge 
in 1997. 
b.  Mr Zuma and I do not socialise and 
have never socialised together.  I accept 
that 
there 
are 
functions 
especially 
government functions which he attended 
and 
I 
attended 
and 
that 
on 
such 
occasions we would greet each other 
and have brief conversations. After I had 
been elevated to the bench in 1997 in 
10 
January 1998 my law firm held a gala 
dinner in Durban for my farewell from my 
law firm and many people were invited 
including 
his 
Majesty 
King 
Goodwill 
Zwelithini.  But Mr Zuma was not among 
those who were invited. I have never 
invited Mr Zuma to any family function 
including my birthdays since I met him in 
the 1990’s.  He has also never invited 
me to any of his birthday parties since 
20 
we got to know each other. 
c. Mr Zuma does not get told when there is 
a death in my family as a result he has 
never 
attended 
any 
of 
the 
family 
funerals we have had since I got to know 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 9 of 160 
 
him.  Even though from the early 1990’s 
to date I have lost four siblings and my 
mother.  I have never attended the 
funeral of any member of the Zuma 
family nor does Mr Zuma inform me 
when there has been any death in his 
family.  To the best of my recollection 
since the 1990’s I have never shared 
any private meals with Mr Zuma. 
d.  I 
have 
never 
been 
to 
Mr 
Zuma’s 
10 
presidential 
office 
when 
he 
was 
President nor did I go to his official 
residence.  
8. In paragraph 29 of his affidavit Mr Zuma 
says and I quote: 
“I can recall an occasion when Deputy 
Chief Justice Zondo was elevated to the 
bench.  We discussed whether our personal 
relationship would jeopardise his judicial 
caveat. We agreed that we would relate in 
20 
a 
manner 
that 
would 
ensure 
that 
his 
judicial caveat is not adversely affected.  I 
understood and appreciated that he wanted 
to draw a line in my relationship with him 
that would create the public perception that 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 10 of 160 
 
he relied on me as President to rise in his 
judicial caveat.” 
9.   No such discussion ever took place nor 
could have      taken place between myself 
and Mr Zuma when I was elevated to the 
bench.  My elevation to the bench occurred 
in 1997.  Mr Zuma says that he understood 
and appreciated that I wanted to draw a 
line in my relationship with him so as not to 
create the public perception that I relied on 
10 
him as President to rise in my judicial 
caveat.  Mr Zuma was not President in 
1997. 
 
He 
was 
MEC 
for 
Economic 
Development in KwaZulu Natal.  As he was 
not President and was only an MEC he 
could not have had any influence on my 
rise in my judicial caveat. 
10. 
Mr 
Zuma 
says 
the 
personal 
relationship between the two of us is such 
that I should have declined my appointment 
20 
as Chairperson of the Commission and that 
it renders me biased against him.  In 2011 
as a Judge of the High Court in Pretoria I 
heard 
an 
application 
concerned 
a 
contested mining right where one of the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 11 of 160 
 
one of the contesting companies belonged 
in part to Mr Duduzane Zuma; Mr Jacob 
Zuma’s son.  I heard full argument in that 
matter and gave judgment against among 
others the company in which Mr Duduzane 
Zuma had an interest.  There was never a 
complaint 
that 
I 
should 
have 
recused 
myself in that matter or that I had found 
against 
Mr 
Duduzane 
Zuma’s 
company 
because I was biased against Mr Zuma’s 
10 
family. That was the Sishen matter.  From 
November 11 – from November 2011 to May 
2012 when I was an acting Justice of the 
Constitutional Court and during the past 
eight 
years 
since 
my 
appointment 
as 
Justice of the Constitutional Court I have 
sat in a number of matters which involved 
Mr Zuma as President in which the court 
has given judgments.  Sometimes against 
him and sometimes in his favour and Mr 
20 
Zuma has never complained over all these 
years that I had the close relationship with 
him which disqualified me from sitting in 
matters in which he was involved.  In none 
of those matters did Mr Zuma ever bring an 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 12 of 160 
 
application for my recusal. 
12. 
 Some of those cases are 
a. Economic Freedom Fighters versus 
Speaker of the National Assembly and 
Others 2016(3) SA 58063 Nkandla 
Judgment. 
b. Economic Freedom Fighters Speakers 
and National Assembly and Others 
2018(2) SA 57163. 
c. Democratic Alliance versus President 
10 
of the Republic of South Africa and 
others 2013(1) SA 248CC.  I think that 
is 
the 
matter 
involving 
the 
appointment of Mr Menzi Simelane as 
NDPP. 
d. Sigcau 
versus 
President 
of 
the 
Republic of South African 2013(9) 
BCLR 1091 CC. 
e. Nxumalo 
versus 
President 
of 
the 
Republic of South Africa 2014(12) 
20 
BCLR 1457 CC. 
f. Makiti 
Wana 
and 
Others 
versus 
President of the Republic of South 
Africa 
and 
Others 
2013(11) 
BCLR 
1251 CC. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 13 of 160 
 
g. United Democratic Movement versus 
Speaker of the National Assembly and 
Others 2017(8) BCLR 1061 CC.  Some 
of these matters were matters where 
the – Mr Zuma as President was cited 
but he did not take active part. 
Professional Relationship between myself and 
Mr Zuma. 
13. 
While I was still in private practice 
as an attorney in the 1990’s I did interact 
10 
with 
ANC 
leaders 
in 
KwaZulu 
Natal 
including Mr Zuma on matters relating to 
the ANC and civic matters.  However Mr 
Zuma was never my client in his personal 
capacity.  I – however I would have 
discussed with him and other ANC leaders 
some legal issues on an informal basis 
even 
if 
no 
legal 
proceedings 
were 
instituted.  My partner in my law firm would 
also have interacted with ANC leaders 
20 
including Mr Zuma.  I confirm that Mr Zuma 
and other ANC leaders approached me at 
the time and asked me to provide legal 
services to King Goodwill Zwelithini but I 
suggested my partner Mr Marta be the one 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 14 of 160 
 
because he had family ties with the Royal 
Family.  In 1996 I did have a one on one 
meeting with Mr Zuma in my law firm when 
I had been instructed by a certain client to 
institute certain legal proceedings against 
him and we met to discuss the matter.  I 
ended up not instituting those proceedings 
because I got appointed as an acting 
Judge 
in 
the 
Labour 
Court 
before 
instituting proceedings and my client had 
10 
to find another lawyer. 
Announcement of 21 September 2020. 
14. 
The announcement I made on 21 
September 2020 was not made in a media 
conference. 
 
It 
was 
made 
at 
the 
commencement of commission proceedings 
on the day when Mr Zuma was supposed to 
have appeared before the commission.  Mr 
Zuma’s attorney had prior to that sent the 
commission a letter dated 1 September 
20 
2020 a copy of which is attached marked 
AA.  It also occurred after the failure by Mr 
Zuma to comply with a Regulation 10.6 
Directive dated 27 August 2020 a copy of 
which is attached marked BB and giving no 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 15 of 160 
 
explanation why he had not complied then 
not apply for an extension of time.” 
That is the end of the statement.  Copies will be made 
to and given to Counsel and all, all, all concerned.  I place 
on record that although I discussed with Counsel the 
statement in chambers they had not seen it because it only 
got ready this morning.  That I mentioned that I would read 
it and I would circulate to Counsel.    Thank you.  Mr 
Sikhakhane.  My Registrar must just make sure that copies 
are given to Counsel for the former President. 
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chairperson thank you for your 
opening statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Sikhakhane. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  I would like to get a couple of things 
of the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Partly because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I must also before you do that I must 
also thank you and your team for understanding with 
regard to the statement that had not been given to you in 
20 
advance. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Thank you Chair we will – we will look 
at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  You make a good point in the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 16 of 160 
 
statement.  You [00:19:03] out the relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  You contextualise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And of course we know that in recusal 
application there is something called a waiver.  It means 
you give even raise it at the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And so although we are going to look 
at your statement and I am not going to cross-examine you 
10 
about it. 
 
Chair I think I should get a couple of things out of 
the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Because this matter has been talked 
about a lot of people have pontificated about what it is we 
doing.  And I thought this opportunity I must use first to 
say contrary to public speculation we advised and brought 
Mr Zuma here to demonstrate to you that he was never 
going to defy you because he understands the nature of 
20 
your job and respects the summons that you issued and he 
was never going to defy that even if we told him to defy 
you. 
 
Secondly Chair since the letter of 28 September 
2020 which indicated that we would this application so 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 17 of 160 
 
much as I said has been said out there and most of it has 
been an attempt to deal with the subject that even scholars 
– legal scholars tell you how difficult it is.  Because it is 
not an open and shut case.  
 
Recusals are difficult and they are difficult because 
in order to approach Judges as I do today you first must 
approach someone you respect which I do and you must 
tell them that you think they have made errors.  And it is 
no easy task.  And this subject is difficult because the 
precedent as I will rely on Safu as you have already 
10 
mentioned it I have my own difficulties with Safu because I 
do think one Judge should have recused himself there. 
 
But be that as it may I will raise these because they 
are difficult.  They are not as easy as analysts and 
journalists have been saying.  Partly because the rules, 
the precedent are set by the judges themselves judging 
those who judge them. 
 
And so judges create rules of how we should them 
and they tell us – they remind me of someone who gives 
you a slap and tells you how to cry.  And so they are 
20 
difficult for that reason. 
 
And I am going to raise today a number of things 
because first Mr Zuma does not do this lightly we say this.  
And unlike many recusal applications which go the integrity 
of the judge both my team and Mr Zuma would never come 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 18 of 160 
 
here to say the reason we asking for your recusal or a way 
to deal with this matter in a particular way as I have deal 
with [00:11:14] it is because our application is about your 
integrity. 
 
That is unquestioned by me or Mr Zuma and Mr 
Zuma. 
 
Lastly Chair a number of issues have been raised 
about whether or not this can be brought and whether we 
are attacking you.  Well Chair I do not need to remind you 
that none of the people who have been making that 
10 
analysis on television claiming all sorts of things are as 
close to you as I am or as related to you as I am or would 
defend you as I would.   
 
So none of them can claim that I would bring a 
frivolous application to you to question you.  Let alone the 
fact that we come from the same village. 
 
Chair that is what I thought I should get out of the 
way because there is a misconception about this by people 
who think they are defending you from a Zuma attack which 
it is not. 
20 
 
And Chair what I am going to do in relying on the 
principles about recusal as I said they are difficult because 
many think we raise this because we say you are biased.  
And we have set out in the affidavit that actually that is not 
the test. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 19 of 160 
 
 
The test is whether a reasonable person sitting in 
an environment that we lawyers take for granted because 
we are familiar with it can apprehend that he is not going 
to get a fair hearing. Now that has nothing to do with the 
integrity of the judge.   
 
The next issue about that is this.  When you raise a 
recusal application one of the things you saying to the 
Judge which is the most difficult part not just because of 
judges because human beings are not good at self-
reflection is to ask the Judge not to check whether he has 
10 
integrity but to ask the Judge to dig deep into his or her 
humanity to check whether – given the hostile environment 
for a witness his conduct – I do not like this word because 
it is associated with something bad but his demeanour, his 
comments and it is not because I am not going to list your 
comments because I think they are bad.  We lawyers do 
this when we cross-examine people because we take 
advantage of our powerful position and we forget that they 
are vulnerable. 
 
And so as much as I am going to rely on these 
20 
principles 
largely 
a 
recusal 
application 
Deputy 
Chief 
Justice is bought to a Judge precisely because you have – 
you trust them. 
 
It is brought to that Judge precisely because only a 
Judge with integrity can sit and listen to him – to people 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 20 of 160 
 
telling him that he may have made a mistake. 
 
And I want to say to you Deputy Chief Justice I will 
– as I have done in the affidavit look at your comments and 
the context of those comments is that as much as this 
environment is easy for you and me and Mr Pretorius it is 
not easy for a client or an ordinary citizen who is sitting as 
an accused.  Because it does not matter what we say about 
Mr Zuma the narrative is that he sits as an accused and 
therefore that is the context within which you must look at 
his 
apprehension 
about 
this 
commission’s 
choice 
of 
10 
witnesses. 
 
This commission’s comments during testimony of 
those witnesses.  This commission’s approach to issues 
that he has raised to the commission.  And as I raise those 
I also raise the fact for a person sitting watching a 
powerful environment in which he is the accused basically I 
want to persuade you Chair first that I want to walk with 
you and look at your comments from the perspective of a 
person who sits watched by millions of people who thinks 
he symbolises corruption. 
20 
 
And that is the context.  So when the test says let 
us look at the reasonable person Chair will see I will share 
this with you because it is something that gets missed in 
the analysis that a lot of scholars like Grant Hammond and 
others let us forget the judgment – the judgements tell you 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 21 of 160 
 
that a recusal application and a test that a person must be 
a reasonable person is also context specific.  And the 
context I am giving you is a Mr Zuma who all of these 
people sitting here most of them journalists the narrative 
they have come for is that here is the man who messed up 
our country.  That narrative on its own – I do not want to 
get into its merits – is the context within which Mr Zuma 
views this environment. 
 
And therefore the test about a reasonable person 
who is not too sensitive is also the test as in the 
10 
Commonwealth they say of a reasonable lay person not a 
lawyer, not a judge. 
 
Chair I am going to address three things.  The last 
of which is what you would love me for because it is about 
how do we get out of this?  It is about remedy.  How do we 
get out of this and have a commission in which each and 
every person particularly the person who was central in the 
remedial action.  You finish this with his contribution and 
without him fearing as he fears now.  And that I will 
discuss with Chair right at the end because I think apart 
20 
from the animosity out there which is political you and me 
have a duty to ensure that a legal process called a 
commission inquiry whether other people see it as a 
political platform to destroy their enemies is not our 
concern as lawyers.  Our concern is a billion rand or so 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 22 of 160 
 
has been poured into this process are you going to be fair 
if at the end that report is driven by a narrative which 
simply accepts that there is one version. 
 
So the first issue I am going to raise Chairperson is 
to take you through the cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second before you do that Mr 
Sikhakhane.  Sorry about that Mr Sikhakhane. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   No problem at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You know, I...  You said you 
are now going to take me to the cases and so on.  So I have 
10 
a particular copy of SARFU that I had looked at and you 
know when you look at one ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on which you have not made any 
underlining’s, it is not as helpful as the one that you have 
used. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is fine.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, I will - depending on what the 
Chair - I have the file of the cases that we look at.  It is the 
20 
cases that the Chairperson knows but I can share that file.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine.  I just wanted the 
SARFU.  But I will get it because ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...I have made some notes.   
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 23 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is fine. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   So Chair, what I will do is to first 
summarise those.  That is the first thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Having done the intro, I wanted to get 
those things out of the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Because they are important to note 
and to deal with the principles of the recusal, as they 
10 
emerge from literature and legal scholars and cases.  And I 
will tell the Chairperson why I am very reluctant about case 
law on recusal.   
 
As much as it guides us, it is actually unreliable because 
the judges are telling the world:  When you judge me, judge 
me this way.  There is something intellectually dishonest 
about that, but that as it may.  I am going to take you to the 
principles so that we can debate whether we need the test. 
 
Second.  I will not dwell much on this Chair but I wanted 
to trace the genesis of the Commission.  I have done it in the 
20 
affidavit.  We have it.  And so I will not waste your time on 
that.  But I do this because contrary to popular views are the 
– and I have had it the very first time when I wrote the letter 
or Mabuza wrote the letter. 
 
There are a lot of [speaker not clear], analysts speaking 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 24 of 160 
 
about this saying you do not do this in a commission of 
inquiry.  Chair, I am going to do this for one reason.   
 
One has to read the remedial action of Advocate Thuli 
Madonsela and the judgment of the North Gauteng High 
Court, to know that the reason the Executive, the President 
who has the constitutional duty to appoint the Commission of 
Inquiry had that task removed from him.  It was precisely 
because impartiality or the perception of impartiality was at 
the centre of the appointment of the establishment of this 
Commission. 
10 
 
So no analyst should tell our public that when it is a 
commission of inquiry, impartial, it is not important.   
 
Secondly.  We ask a judge to lead it because Chair you 
can never strip yourself, the principles and your oath just 
because you are now leading a commission of inquiry into 
[speaker not clear]. 
 
The reason we ask a judge is to borrow from a 
profession 
that 
those 
ethics 
and 
those 
standards 
of 
impartiality are slightly higher than the ordinary person. 
 
And so the third issues I want to deal with and probably 
20 
the last before I deal with remedy, is to take you to your 
comments 
that 
have 
raised 
concerns 
during 
these 
proceedings. 
 
And we raise them not because those comments, as I 
said at the beginning, mean that you are going to find in a 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 25 of 160 
 
particular way because the recusal application that deal with 
the fact that there has already been an outcome. 
 
I think most of the cases, the BTR, Delaysey(?) [speaker 
not clear] and Others.  All of those cases tend to deal with a 
situation when a person post facto is unhappy with the 
finding. 
 
And there are other recusal applications where people 
say this judge has a personal interest in the outcome, either 
a pecuniary interest or it is an interest on the outcome 
because you are relying to it.   
10 
 
That is not our contention in this matter.  We do not 
really...  We do not make this submission that you have an 
interest in the outcome and therefore you will go that 
direction. 
 
And so what we do Deputy Chief Justice is to say to you 
is that reduced to its essential elements, this application 
seeks to persuade you.   
 
Maybe it will not be for Mr Zuma but for the continuation 
of this one, to look honestly and sincerely at some of the 
comments that we will identify and we content to you that 
20 
they would find an litigant who is sitting – not litigant, a 
witness – who is sitting before you. 
 
And Chair here are the principles that you and me know 
as the test for bias.  But as I have indicated to you Chair.  
Let us start with bias as a concept before we get to 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 26 of 160 
 
reasonable apprehension.   
 
Is that the difficulty with bias for psychologist, for 
lawyers, for human beings is that it struggles two domains, 
at least for your purposes. 
 
It struggles the domain of law and the domain of 
psychology.  And that is what it makes it difficult.  I say the 
domain of psychology because I am appealing to your psych 
here.  I am appealing to your honesty about your own errors. 
 
It is law because we look at how to tighten claims of 
bias that are raised by lawyers and litigants, simply to 
10 
disqualify a judge.  And so it is important that we make that 
balance and because it is not made clear. 
 
So bias is the state of mind.  But what are we to do 
when a ask a judge to recuse themselves because we have a 
reasonable apprehension of bias? 
 
When there is a case, it is R v S, Canadian Court of 
Appeal.  [speaker not clear].  It is a court of appeal case 
Chair which accepted the definition that is in R v Bertram 
about defining bias as a start.  It says: 
“It is a tendency, inclination and/or predisposition 
20 
towards one side or another for a particular result.  
In its application to legal proceedings, it represents 
a predisposition to decide and issue or cause in 
such a way which does not leave the judicial mind 
perfectly open to conviction.   
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 27 of 160 
 
Bias is a condition of state of mind which sways 
judgement and renders a judicial officer unable to 
exercise 
his 
or 
her 
functions 
impartially 
in 
a 
particular case.” 
 
Let me make an example for your purposes.  Chair, may 
I make this example?  Our judges in criminal courts sit and 
listen to the most gruesome crimes.  Gruesome.  More 
gruesome than what our judges in the civil courts listen to.  
And I think the public and you and lawyers who are honest 
will agree with me.   
10 
 
Those judges sit, compose themselves, keep quiet, 
listen, 
really 
comment 
for 
one 
reason, 
because 
they 
understand that once you comment and you fork outrage, in 
way or the other, you create in the mind of the person who is 
sitting vulnerable in your court or your forum, an impression 
that they are right inside the slaughterhouse.   
 
And so Chair, I am citing our magistrate’s and our 
judges in criminal courts because they mastered this.  They 
keep quiet when someone is testifying about the rape of a 
three-year-old.  They keep quiet, compose themselves. 
20 
 
Our judges in the civil courts throw their hands in the air 
because there are no board minutes [speaker not clear], 
because people may have stolen money. 
 
I am not saying that crime is small.  What I am 
emphasising DCJ is the obligation to create in a forum and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 28 of 160 
 
environment that does not frighten a witness.  That is bias.  
It is that inclination. 
 
And therefore, as I will show in your comments.  When 
Mr Zuma is sitting, watching at home the narrative playing 
itself here that his years of President were nine wasted 
years and he watches the Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, I have not said that. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   [laughing] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing]   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   No, Chair you have not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not said that.  [laughing]   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, you will understand that most 
people believe that what we must do for my client is to give 
him orange overalls and walk him to Kgosi Mampuru Prison.  
But I am raising this because Chair I am not saying you have 
said anything of that nature.  I am not suggestion you have 
pre-judged this matter in any way. 
 
I am saying to you, in your comments in his absence, I 
want you to walk with me and look at whether a reasonable 
person 
accused 
as 
he 
is 
would 
be 
– 
it 
would 
be 
20 
unreasonable of him to feel that the forum seeks to punish 
him.  Seeks to lynch him.  Seeks to agree with people who 
have come here to lynch him, basically.   
 
Seeks to agree with the political project to destroy him 
as a symbol of a particular political narrative in society and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 29 of 160 
 
therefore, for me, that is the test we must use.   
 
Now in the same case that I have quoted in the Court of 
Appeal, it accepted that partiality can be described as the 
inability of the decision-maker or judicial officer to prevent 
his or her biases and dispositions in conducting the matter 
from making a decision.  That is not where we are Chair 
because it is not about the decision and therefore, we are 
not dealing with whether or not your decision is necessarily 
changed [speaker not clear].   
 
We submit this.  That this inability that is stated in R v S 
10 
in the Canadian Court of Appeal, is akin to the South African 
principle that despite his or her bias or predisposition, the 
decision-maker or judicial officer must bring an open mind.  
So that Chair is an acceptance that all of us in this room are 
biased including judges.   
 
And the reason people are appointed judges is because 
they are slightly more honest than we are about their bias.  
They have the ability to confront them.   
 
And so what emerges from this case is the fact that what 
is asked for in a recusal is self-reflection.  And very, very 
20 
few human beings have that, lawyers, politicians and 
journalists are the worse. 
 
And so, what that principles tells the Chair is that the 
inclination that it talks about may well be justified outrage.  I 
am not going to stand here Chair and tell you that you 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 30 of 160 
 
cannot justify to be outraged by some of the things you hear.  
You are.   
 
What I am asking you is.  In that outrage, like the judge 
listening to the rape of a two-year-old.  What are you 
supposed to do?  Now before I get misinterpreted as 
conflating court in this forum.  Chair, it does not matter what 
forum it is.   
 
I understand fully that you have a difficult task here than 
you have in your court.  In your courts you must make a 
decision based on what is in front of you.  Commissions of 
10 
inquiries are difficult because they turn a judge, who is 
supposed to coldly look at the facts and make a findings, 
they turn you into an investigator. 
 
So 
they 
are 
both 
adjudicative 
in 
some 
way 
and 
inquisitorial and in a way you have to strike that balance and 
I appreciate your difficulty but I, honestly, suggest to you 
through the quotes that I will make Chair, that there have 
been time when even I sitting watching think – have thought 
the DCJ has crossed that line.  Not of bias but the line of 
how to express outrage when you hear it as a presiding 
20 
officer.   
 
And Chair, the last point is actually made in the SARFU 
case, so that we bring it closer to home.  Chair I said it 
earlier about SARFU.  I know it is the final decision that was 
made and we cannot – it cannot be appealed but we can 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 31 of 160 
 
criticise it because it is a very big subject. 
 
In fact, the last author who has produced a book on this 
subject, as I said Grant Amon.  It is new.  He tells us in his 
last chapters that this is not open and shut for intellectuals, 
for true intellectuals.  It is not.   
 
And here is what happened at SARFU.  The Chair said 
earlier that - and correctly read the statement because that 
principle comes from it.  Now of course, the principle they 
say, is this.  They say at the beginning at paragraph 35 of 
the judgment: 
10 
“A cornerstone of any fair and just legal system is 
the impartial adjudication of disputes which come 
before the courts and other tribunals.  This applies, 
of course, to both criminal and civil cases as well as 
to judicial and administrative procedures.” 
 
I pause there to make this point because our public has 
been fought this narrative by people who want to see their 
faces on TV for two reasons.  To say impartiality is not 
required outside court.  And so it continues. 
 
It says: 
20 
“Nothing is more likely to impair confidence in such 
proceedings, whether on the part of litigants or the 
general public, than actual bias (which is not our 
case) or the appearance of bias in the official or 
officials who have the power to adjudicate disputes.” 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 32 of 160 
 
 
This rule against bias is fundamental in our system.  It is 
fundamental whether we are recusing Mr Pretorius where he 
works.  We want to discipline him.  Every human being 
facing a tribunal at work, requires impartiality of the 
adjudicator.   
 
We submit that an affected person or let us say, directly 
implicated, in our case.  The applicant is entitled to an 
impartial commission and chairperson.   
 
In this regard, we make the point that it is the comments 
and conduct of how he is treated, singled out, subjected to 
10 
press statements that singles him out to fear the platform. 
 
And then in the case of Daniel and Another v Speaker of 
the National Assembly, the following is said, paragraph 16 
thereof: 
“There is a lot of fundamental breach of the common 
law rule of natural justice by the ad-hoc committee, 
namely the [speaker not clear] rule. 
This rule requires that an affected party must be 
heard by an impartial and unbiased tribunal. 
For purposes of the rule, there should not be a 
20 
reasonable suspicion that the ad-hoc committee was 
biased.” 
So equally important is that the commission and the 
chairperson are obliged to observe natural justice principles 
because recusal applications have their jealousies in the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 33 of 160 
 
trust that natural justice governs all legal proceedings.   
 
This is because – and it has been said on each and 
every case that I have cited, the South African cases 
included.  This is because they must not only meet our 
justice fairly but must be seemed to be doing so. 
 
And Chair, that is important of what I have said earlier, 
of creating an environment that would make this report you 
are going to produce not a report that political enemies out 
there expect.   
 
I mean, we can tell now what Mr Zuma’s political 
10 
enemies want the report to say, that he was responsible for 
State Capture, nine wasted years.  That is what they want 
and if you do not say that Chair, they will review you. 
 
What we want, and I think everyone who thinks honestly 
about this without prejudice, without hating – is that this 
report must be able to assist our nation in future against 
possibilities of plunder.  Not by one side.  By everybody. 
 
No one, when we make policy in future, must be able to 
do whatever you will have find has been done.  I assume that 
the Chair has not found so far. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not found.  [laughing]   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Absolutely.  And Chair, I am going to 
raise this point again about justice and what we need here 
and I am going to quite a theorist, a political theorist and a 
lawyer.  I have been quoting judges.  Rosanna(?) [speaker 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 34 of 160 
 
not clear] says something about a right of freedom of 
expression, exercised by journalist and everybody.  At the 
end of writing about freedom of expression, [speaker not 
clear]says: 
“Actually, the right to freedom of expression is the 
right that should be enjoyed by people who we 
dislike and disagree with.” 
 
Justice – and this is my quote – we are not just when we 
are judged against how we treat people we like.  The real 
test about commitment to justice by a judge, by a citizen and 
10 
anyone that is worth the term human.   
 
Justice is how you treat those at the bottom of your 
pecking order.  How do you treat people you despise?  How 
you do you treat a man that you have already assumed 
messed up your country?  That is justice.  Do you treat him 
humanly when you have brought him into a process?  And 
this what these cases are about.   
 
Is, we as lawyers and judges, have to guarantee society 
that when people walk into this process, they are judged out 
there.  People do not make evidence that Mr Zuma was 
20 
corrupt.  They have written about it.  They say he is.  That is 
the political game here because we are a modern society.  
 
Mr Zuma, even if he is at the bottom of the pecking 
order of people we like, it is how we treat him that we are 
judged about our commitment to justice, not how we treat the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 35 of 160 
 
darlings and sweetheart witnesses that have come here, 
pretending they were not party to what they are saying.  
Telling others to connect the dots.  Accept their dots. 
 
It is how we treat every witness.  And so that is Chief 
Justice that principle is what guides what we are saying.  
And the test, as I have said, has to components.  One is the 
one I said I dislike because it is judges telling those who 
judge them, how to judge them.  It is impartiality. 
 
And one of the difficulties I have in this court, apart from 
the fact that I am the first one briefed to tell the second in 
10 
command in the country judiciary to recuse himself, is that I 
have to climb the mountain of the presumption of impartiality 
and I accept that that is a mountain to climb for any recusal 
application and it goes like this. 
 
I am supposed to presume that you are impartial.  That 
is not what you do.  I start there.  And so that presumption is 
important and that I why I started where I started Deputy 
Chief Justice.  That this is not about your integrity because I 
assume your impartiality as a person. 
 
And then the second leg of this test is what gets murky 
20 
about is, when am I reasonable apprehending that I am not 
having a fair forum?  And this must be judged Chair, not from 
the position of those who love Mr Zuma, who have affection 
for him.  No.   
 
Nor must it be judged from the position of those who 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 36 of 160 
 
seemed to have a natural anti-party towards him.  Those we 
should discard.  Both those sides.  Because they want 
nothing that law wants.   
 
What we must test today is whether a reasonable person 
in the context of how this Commission was started and how 
Mr Zuma has been defined when coming here.  That is the 
context.   
 
And the reasonable person is a difficult concept because 
it introduces the concept I am talking about and that context 
is not generally applicable to everybody.  It is specific to a 
10 
particular litigant but I accept that it is an objective test.  
 
So Chair, and that is why when they say in SARFU that – 
and in many other cases – the principle is like a deformation.  
We should not judge this because Mr Zuma or any litigant 
who seeks a recusal is a high sensitive human being who 
just wants to walk into forums that are friendly to him.  That 
type of person is not a reasonable person.   
 
The other is what you find in the other cases BTR and 
Others, where lawyers themselves and litigants who have 
lost or seek a forum shopping, seem to come with things to 
20 
judges, just to get rid of them. 
 
One such case here, I think, is a case where people 
simply said:  I did not like the judge’s demeanour.  He was 
talking to me in a rude way.  Right?  And so what we the test 
tries to do is to balance those extremes and abuses of the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 37 of 160 
 
legal system by us lawyers and litigants. 
 
And so it say that we just judge it in a manner that takes 
into account the context which I have explained and the 
person must be reasonable. 
 
Chair, I am going to say reasonable, because only 
yesterday, a lot of people got into this forum today about 
whether Mr Zuma will come because it is an assumption.  I 
do not know why.  There is an assumption that he will not.   
 
And that context Chair is important when you analyse 
what is reasonable for Mr Zuma as he faces what you will 
10 
see tonight on TV because he can do no right.  That kind of 
litigant sitting before you, has his context about this forum. 
 
And I want to invite you to look at yourself and the 
comments that I am going to raise that you make, not 
because you were judging but because you may have 
created 
an 
environment 
that 
enforces 
in 
his 
mind, 
reasonable be so, that this forum is an extension of the 
narrative about him that everything wrong in South Africa is 
attributable to him.   
 
And Chair, so what is the real test that you have to do 
20 
when judging this?  Apart from the fact that I am going to 
rely on your capacity on self-reflection is, that the starting 
point is an analyses of, how does this Commission start?  
Who is central?   
 
I have been told by two courts already that:  No, the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 38 of 160 
 
reason the function of the executive was moved to the 
judiciary is because Mr Zuma could not be allowed to appoint 
a judge.  I am not raising this because of the ground.  I am 
raising it because it is that you must take into account.   
 
I have been told by two courts that they do not presume 
impartiality on their part.  That a judge appointed by 
Mr Zuma would have been partial.  I have been outraged by 
this suggestion because I have seen judges not relying on 
the presumption of their own impartiality.   
 
And therefore, that context for Mr Zuma and the history 
10 
when he is removed from a decision that he thinks he must 
make, is the first start. 
 
And so Chair, that context, when you analyse the 
reasonableness of his claim is important.  IN BTR, they deal 
with actual bias actually.  And the AD said:  Actual bias in 
the sense that the litigant and he had approached the easel 
before him with a mind which was in fact prejudice or not 
open to conviction.   
 
Chair, this is a bit too far and it is not the case I am 
making to you.  The case I am making to you is slightly lower 
20 
than that.  It is a case about - because they all evolve 
around the same.  May I say to the Chair, the Bernert v 
Absa Bank case, as important as it is, it talks about 
shares, a judge who had shares and therefore has no 
application 
here 
but 
it 
may 
be 
important 
for 
the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 39 of 160 
 
Chairperson to look at it. 
 
The other case that we rely on is the SACCAWU 
case where the Constitutional Court slightly expanded the 
test for recusal against the judge and my I just read this 
and then the other cases I will cite for the Chair to note 
because you were part of some of them.  I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   But I am not going to ask you to 
recuse yourself from those.  So it says: 
“In formulating the test…” 
10 
This is paragraph 12 of the SACCAWU case. 
“In formulating the test in the terms quoted above 
the court observed that two considerations are built 
into the test itself.  The first is that in considering 
the application for recusal the court, as a starting 
point, presumed that judicial officers are impartial.” 
I have already stated that.   
As later emerges from the SARFU judgment, this 
inbuilt aspect entails two further consequences.  On the 
one hand it is the applicant for recusal who bears, as we 
20 
do, the onus of rebutting the presumption of judicial 
impartiality.   
On 
the 
other, 
the 
presumption 
is 
not 
easily 
dislodged, it requires cogent and convincing evidence to 
be rebutted.  Chair, when I said I had the mountain to 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 40 of 160 
 
climb, I made this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And, Chair, I say this because many 
of us would argue that a slight comment by a judge – I 
mean, many of us have faced more cantankerous judges in 
this country and you are not one of them and we know they 
make comments about people but let me give this example. 
 
If you went on Rule 43 application in spousal 
dispute about maintenance and you sit there as a mother 
asking for maintenance and the judge flippantly said you 
10 
know, 
you 
women 
are 
gold 
diggers, 
of 
course 
that 
comment, Chair, does not mean the judge will decide in a 
particular way, he can say no, I was just making comment. 
but I want you to put yourself in the shoes of that women 
with kids, who is asking for maintenance for survival, 
hearing a judge say, you know, you guys are just gold 
diggers.  That comment, even if it comes from a – let us 
call it a flippant place, it was a – you misspoke, the fact 
that you misspoke does not  reduce the effect of your 
misspeaking to the litigant who is facing a barrage of 
20 
situations. 
 
And so, Chair, I will not go to the test for actual 
bias because I do not have to meet that test.  Chair, I want 
to take you – and the other cases, as I said, is the 
Tshabalala case, I would like the Chair to look at that, the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 41 of 160 
 
other case that the Chair has already mentioned is the 
SARFU case.   
Chair, may I suggest as well because I am not being 
disrespectful 
to 
judges 
and 
their 
judgments, 
is 
that 
literature by legal scholars, who are not judges trying to 
defend themselves, it is much more important here and I 
can share with the Chair some of the literature that comes 
from someone who is not a judge, who is a scholar, who is 
not trying to defend the club, the class called judges 
because they are much more objective in the tests.  The 
10 
last chapter of that book called Judicial Recusal by Grant 
Hammond has a whole reading about how to – what route 
to be taken because it recognises that this matter has not 
been debated as thoroughly as it should be because the 
leaders of the debate are the subjects of the attacks. 
 
And, Chair, so what have you done?  What exactly 
have you done that has caused us to come here?  What 
have you said that has made Mr Zuma believe, reasonably, 
that this forum is not good for him? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we get to that and maybe we will 
20 
take the tea adjournment and then [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I wanted to raise – we will go to the 
comments as you have indicated in due course.  You know, 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 42 of 160 
 
when I was still new in practice as a lawyer going to the 
lower courts, appearing full of enthusiasm, coming from 
university and, you know, one of the experiences I had in 
some of the courts in which I appeared were cases where I 
would appear before a presiding officer and I present 
argument and the presiding officer just keeps quiet.  I go 
on and on and I quote authorities, in this case, this is what 
happened, in this case, this is what happened, these are 
the principles.  The presiding officer just sits and keeps 
quiet.  I never get to know whether – what he or she is 
10 
thinking, I would never get to know and then maybe one 
question there but sometimes no question and at the end 
of argument, either immediately or later, judgment is given 
and when I read the judgment I say, you know, I do not 
think he or she understood the argument.  If only she had 
engaged me and questioned the submissions that I was 
making because then we would have had an engagement 
and I would have clarified some of the things. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, somebody sitting there could 
20 
say 
oh, 
this 
magistrate 
or 
presiding 
officer 
is 
very 
impartial, he said nothing, she said nothing, she just 
listened, you know?  But I must say that I preferred those 
who would question what I am saying so that we could 
engage in a debate because then I could tell if I was 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 43 of 160 
 
persuading him or her and also I could tell when he or she 
puts up a point for which I have no answer, you know, so 
when you get the judgment you feel that look, I was heard 
properly because whatever difficulties the presiding officer 
may have had inside, as I presenting my argument, he or 
she verbalised them and I was able to address them, but 
the one who keeps quiet throughout, you might think she or 
he has no problem, but maybe she does have problems but 
she does not tell you and you feel the unfairness when you 
see the judgment. 
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but I raise this point in relation to the 
issue of comments, to which we will come, to say one of 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
Commission 
proceedings 
being 
televised and so on is that persons, whether implicated or 
not, can listen or watch as a particular witness gives 
evidence and sometimes I put certain questions, I put 
certain remarks, because I am thinking when the person 
who is being implicated comes here, hopefully they are 
listening or they will read the transcript, I want them to 
20 
know what was going on in my mind as I was listening to 
this witness, so that they can address it, I am not hiding it 
from them. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If I like I could just sit quietly, do not 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 44 of 160 
 
indicate what I am thinking but the benefit to the implicated 
person, if I speak, is that they can, when they come and 
say you know, Chair, when this witness who implicated me 
was speaking, this is what you said, I want to take this 
opportunity to show you that that is not the position.  So at 
least it is meant as part of transparency rather than just 
keep quiet and say so this person that they are talking 
about is such a bad person but, you know?  So I just 
mention that and …[intervenes] 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair, I appreciate that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you may address it …[intervenes] 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, can I say a parting shot to 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, sure. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I would not differ with you on all of 
that.  The reasons all of you are called Judge, it is 
because the term means, unlike me and everyone here, 
you can – being a judge is a centrist position, it requires 
you not go for those extremes but to seek to strike that 
balance because sitting quietly and doing nothing, I only 
20 
have a Zulu word for it uktuba(?) it means you have 
decided oh, you do not want to me to talk so I will sit 
quietly and say nothing.  That too is wrong.  All the 
comments that are made flippantly without self-restraint 
have the same effect, so a judge who decides to go either 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 45 of 160 
 
extreme may be immature to say because I am questioning 
your comments, alright, I am going to sit and say nothing.   
 
What 
is 
required 
are 
comments 
that 
seek 
to 
understand, to intellectually engage but what we are 
raising – Chair, let me tell you, Deputy Chief Justice, 
because it has happened to me.  We go – I go for Mr Zuma 
to many courts.  Only once, and I have had a lot, I have 
had a judge doubt my integrity, that I am corrupt because I 
represent him.  Now those are comments that you do not 
want because you can be engaged intellectually for the 
10 
whole day, I do not mind.  What I mind is when a comment 
crosses that line and I think for a judge too, there is 
something about being called Judge that is about striking 
the balance in society about extremes and we make those 
as examples here not because any malice.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, that is fine. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea adjournment, we are 
at 18 minutes past eleven.  Let us resume at twenty five to 
twelve.   
20 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Sikhakhane? 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 46 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, can I just 
briefly go to the beginning of when you read your 
statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   As Chair acknowledged that maybe I 
did not know that you were going to turn yourself into a 
witness.  And secondly – and I want to consider whether – 
because now you have read a statement in which you have 
a version about your relationship with him... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I would like to get time to consult 
with him because as Chair will agree it is possible that the 
two of you have different versions about that relationship.  
But I have no instruction at the moment, I have no time… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I just ask the Chair after today or 
tomorrow I may have time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And will tell my learned friend Paul if 
it is uncontroversial. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Your versions about the two of you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Your versions are consistent.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 47 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think in the SARFU matter the 
statements were given to – by the justice of the court to 
counsel 
and 
counsel 
and 
their 
clients 
accepted 
the 
statement of facts.  So that is what happened there, ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, yes, I am not even suggesting 
that there is something in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I do want to just at least for integrity 
of the process to do that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, the grounds that we have 
raised in our affidavit, in Mr Zuma’s affidavit – oh, the 
other issue, Chair, there is a replying affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   That Prof Mosala filed an affidavit on 
Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I am not sure much turns into it but 
we have answered it, I have given – I want to place it on 
20 
record, it is unsigned at the moment.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. Ja, let me have it.  But from what 
you say it looks like I might not need to bother to read now 
because you do not say much about it in your address. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, we do not because it is done 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 48 of 160 
 
this morning and two, quite frankly, this is not one of those 
cases where we are going to deal with – it may rely on how 
deal with the principles of Plascon Evans. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   That is why I am saying the difficulty 
of your statement is if my client tells me that your version 
is not consistent with his.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, you will see that 
in the affidavit, this process where we deal with the 
10 
grounds is set out from paragraph 33 of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, what it does without – I do not 
want to take the Chair - to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Paragraph 33 up to I think paragraph 
47. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Without reading that, what that 
ground says read – or considered together with all the 
20 
other grounds and the pattern that they form, is that when 
this Commission started …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I just want to make sure I 
have got the right page. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 49 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I think I went to 33 at the bottom but 
you meant 33 at the top? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The red numbers, is that right? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The red numbers? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   The page number?  I am looking at 
paragraph 33 of the affidavit, I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, you will not need to go there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I am hoping to summarise this,  
rather than spend too much time on them is that, Chair, I 
am raising this first ground because on its own it is a weak 
ground, on its own, if I were to bring this case to you 
simply on this ground and I am saying I want you to look at 
this ground in the context of the other grounds and how 
this whole thing started and the pattern that it takes.   
 
Chair, Mr Zuma submits that this Commission, when 
it started, as he has said before, is that it starts - because 
20 
he is alleged to be at the centre of a crime that is not 
found in any other statute in South Africa, it is called State 
Capture.  Of course we all know it is not in POCA, it is not 
in Criminal Procedure Act, it is a political concept that 
political 
opponents 
have 
created 
to 
deal 
with 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 50 of 160 
 
misdemeanours of the other political opponents but it does 
not exist in law.  And of course I know that, Chair, you 
fetched or two experts from America, the most captured 
State to come and tell us the dangers of this crime. 
 
Now how do we identify witnesses from the position 
of my client?  This Commission starts with witnesses who 
aligned themselves with the narrative, with the version that 
there is something called State Capture and Mr Zuma is 
responsible for it.   
If the Chairperson looks back at the witnesses that 
10 
were picked by this Commission – and the reasons may 
well be good, I do not know the reasons - when a State is 
captured, Chair, suppose – I hope we never get there in 
this country, when a State is captured, you need a wide 
range of perspectives about what exactly happened in it.  
You do not need to call only Barbara Hogan and Pravin 
Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas, who are proponents of that 
theory.   
If intellectually you want to deal with this subject - 
because it is not a legal subject, it is purely a political 
20 
concept.  Our suggestion is that the Commission lined up 
right at the beginning proponents of this theory called 
State Capture and I am not suggesting that Mr Zuma 
should have been called first for his version, I am 
suggesting that if one really looks at the beginning, the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 51 of 160 
 
first days of this Commission, we were listening to horror 
stories of people on the rooftops telling us they are not 
corrupt, they are angels, there is this thing called state 
capture, they may be right, but that selection of witnesses 
by a commission, by this Commission, for a very long time 
who parrot one version, gives the impression that a 
decision – no, that their version has been accepted, that 
there was state capture, has been accepted.   
And so that selection on its own, even in the 
cabinet, if we look at the people who were picked to come 
10 
to this Commission and spend two days, truly, truly 
spewing their political theories about their opponents, it 
was people who are proponents of a particular narrative in 
the South African body politic and I am not saying they are 
wrong, I am saying this Commission lined them up in a way 
that is un-intellectual, that would not have encouraged 
debate about this difficult subject. 
And therefore, my client, sitting at home, having 
been head of state, listening to witnesses most of whom 
are people who have an axe to grind with him, either 
20 
because he fired them or he did not intervene in some HR 
issue they were involved in, truly that selection created an 
impression 
that 
a 
particular 
version 
may 
have 
been 
accepted.   
What you will find in those paragraphs is that we 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 52 of 160 
 
cite at paragraph 31.1 up to 35.9 and I do not really want 
to denigrate those witnesses because they did not select 
themselves, I hope, is that if you look at them, Chair, the 
ones are picked and the ones – the star witnesses of this 
Commission when it started, Mr Pravin Gordhan, Mcebisi 
Jonas, Nhlanhla Nene, [indistinct] Mahlodi, Vytjie Mentor, 
Trevor Manuel, Ms Barbara Hogan, Themba Masego and 
Fikile Mbalula, right?   
And I want to be clear, I am not criticising the 
testimony of those witnesses.  I am saying if one looks at 
10 
what they had come here to say is a particular narrative 
about Mr Zuma.   
This Commission, the question may be, what could 
it do because Chair, you were at pains asking people to 
come and I think you were at pains because you wanted all 
versions but they were not coming.   
But, of course, we know that your Commission could 
have gone to different people in that cabinet, some of 
whom have a particular opposing theory on the subject 
matter.  I do not personally agree intellectually with the 
20 
two theories you brought from the U.S and I would suggest 
that their version is not the end of the story about this 
difficult concept.  So that is the first ground. 
But, as I said at the beginning, this ground is weak 
on its own, you will see it when you look at the pattern of 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 53 of 160 
 
other things.  And so the first ground, Chair, was that that 
selection lined up people that truly had a gripe and an axe 
to grind with Mr Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I recognise the concession, I do not 
know if it is a concession, but the point you make that 
standing on its own this is not your strongest point but I do 
want to raise this question.  
Is it open to a witness or a person such as Mr Zuma 
to complain about those – or what emerges from those 
witnesses in circumstances where he had the opportunity 
10 
to 
apply 
for 
leave 
to 
cross-examine 
them 
and 
get 
somebody like you to basically deal with their versions and 
by the time they leave the witness stand there is a 
complete picture that has emerged from the picture they 
may have painted at the beginning but chose not to do so. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, there may be an 
argument that says it does not matter what sequence 
different witnesses follow in being brought to give evidence 
as long as there is a fair opportunity given to the people 
20 
they implicate, for example, to challenge their evidence 
and cross-examine them and show them to be persons who 
have maybe some gripe with them or some scores to settle, 
that is why they say a, b, c, d about them.   
Of course, if you do not that, you to come and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 54 of 160 
 
actually cross-examine them, challenge what they have to 
say, whatever evidence they have given might remain in 
the minds of the people whereas if you had used that 
opportunity, what would remain is what the picture looked 
like after an effective cross-examination. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, you are taking me to a 
complaint about you I did not want to raise because it is 
not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   In fact, Chair, you know, had I apply 
10 
to cross-examine Mr Jonas who spoke for two days and it 
has happened here, I would have been given an hour to 
deal with someone who speaks for two days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Insinuating my client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, not necessarily an hour.  What is 
done is – well, I think actually the counsel who cross-
examined him ultimately cross-examined him for no less 
than two hours but, you know, an application is made and 
argument is addressed and we take into account what you 
20 
have to say. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Very often – I have said this recently – 
very often counsel who have cross-examined have found - 
have been able to cross-examine within that hour or two 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 55 of 160 
 
hours.  I cannot remember – I remember one, I do not know 
if it is the one who was cross-examining Mr Jonas, who had 
some concerns but the discussions ended up with him 
saying no, it is fine, you can send some submissions. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the idea is to try and strike a balance 
with taking too long but at the same time try and make sure 
that there is fairness.   So you would have applied, Mr 
Sikhakhane, and if an hour or two hours was not enough, 
we would have looked at …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, I digress, it was not fair of me 
to raise that complaint to you because we did not apply. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is alright. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   But the point I was making, Chair, I 
think it is because you and me are lawyers that you say it 
does – the order does not matter.  Chair, the order does in 
environments of this nature where for two years you call 
people who parrot a particular narrative about people.  It 
may not apply to you and me as lawyers because we sit 
here and deal with cases and we – usually we forget about 
20 
the world of propaganda out there against humans beings 
but I think when you line up witnesses for 18 months who 
parrot a particular version in an environment of this nature 
about somebody, it may have an effect on them but the 
point I wanted to dispel, Chair, because it is – we have 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 56 of 160 
 
seen letters from Prof Mosala, for instance, and before 
that.  This notion, it ended at 12 last night and the last 
statement that Mr Zuma will not come here was issued by 
some foundation related to one of the witnesses. 
 
This issue that Mr Zuma refused to come here, 
Chair, is with respect false, it is untrue.  What has 
happened in this – I am saying the Chair is telling a lie, I 
am saying it is peddled that Mr Zuma – it is in the papers 
of 
this 
Commission, 
letters 
to 
us, 
asking 
us, 
even 
incompetently, to give guarantees whether he will comply 
10 
and you can see what that is. 
 
Chair, I have been before you with Mr Zuma.  And, 
Chair, I have not asked him whether I should tell you this, 
but let me tell you.  In the time since Mr Zuma was here, 
called in that particular way, he has had two moments of 
serious illness for which you saw the need that he would 
meet his doctors and there I say to you, Chair, had you met 
his 
doctors, 
the 
entire 
approach 
to 
how 
he 
is 
communicated, how he is talked to by your Professor 
Mosala or somebody else would be different because you 
20 
would know what he was facing between September last 
year and now.   
 
The second incident is that Mr Zuma for reasons 
that probably did become public changed lawyers in the 
middle of Covid 19.  I only saw him three times since then 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 57 of 160 
 
and when he changed lawyers – and those who are 
practicing advocates, who are not peddlers of narratives 
out there know this, when you attorney is fired, you have 
no brief at that point and for moments – for months of that 
exchange and the interaction, the handover was difficult 
because 
of 
circumstances 
of 
the 
change 
of 
legal 
representatives and Covid and so it is not true that there 
has been refusal.   
Up to now I can tell this Commission, as I make 
these bold suggestions, Chair, about how you have run this 
10 
Commission and things you have said, that Mr Zuma up to 
ten minutes ago still tells me he believes that this 
Commission at some point must hear his version and so 
there are circumstances, Chair, that happened – and I do 
not want to blame the Commission because we too are to 
blame as Mr Zuma’s lawyers because there were problems 
on our side that just made it difficult for us to present 
things to you.  So I want to dispel that notion.  That is my 
argument against your assertion.  He did not refuse to take 
the opportunity. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And then, Chair, having dealt with 
the part about the selection of witnesses, the next ground 
you will see, Chair, is also that Mr Zuma came to this 
Commission, 
made 
serious 
allegations 
about 
this 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 58 of 160 
 
Commission factually and what he thinks or what he 
thought then and still thinks today were problems with this 
Commission 
that 
would 
have 
concerned 
you 
and 
he 
apprehends that those themselves seem to have been 
ignored, the fact that he came here and raised serious 
issues 
about 
this 
place, 
this 
Commission, 
being 
an 
extension – and I am making no suggestion, Chair, about 
you and my learned friends, I am saying it is not 
impossible, Chair, it is not impossible in politics that as we 
sit here we are all pawns in a very big intelligence game. It 
10 
is not impossible.   
We do not know that because we are lawyers, we do 
not know that world, the world of smokescreens and I am 
saying when a witness who is at the centre of what you are 
investigating appears and says to you, do you know that 
we are presiding over a project whose outcome is to deal 
with certain opponents?  And I am not saying that version 
was necessarily correct.  So a number of those were not 
taken up with him in the letters that we got. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Sikhakhane, I am sorry to interrupt 
20 
you. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to note the second ground 
without going to the affidavit. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Thanks, Chair. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 59 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you want to just to mention it 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, it is the fact that he gave 
testimony, very serious testimony about what you are 
presiding over. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And, Chair, he is of the view that 
that was ignored, disregarded, ridiculed because it does 
not align itself with the dominant version that was given by 
the earlier witnesses. 
10 
 
Now, Chair, let me move to the comments that you 
have made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well, just one point.  The affidavit I 
think does not say how – what it is that should have 
happened between the time he gave evidence and now to 
reflect that the Commission has not ignored it.  Obviously 
you cannot – you cannot give evidence, lead evidence but I 
am just raising that I have seen that in the affidavit. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, I mean, I – you will remember I 
20 
allowed him, you know, time to say what he had to say until 
he said well, it is fine for now. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will see some other time.  So – and of 
course one was going to wait for him to come back and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 60 of 160 
 
then take it from there. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, Chair.  Ja, it is difficult because 
we are both in a precarious position of having to give – but 
let me risk it.  Chair, I said in this Commission that there 
are times when I personally feel the right hand does not 
know what the left hand is doing and I think, Chair, there is 
a way you and this Commission can assure him that you 
are investigating the claims – your investigators are 
investigating the claims that he made about how we are 
here, that this is the grave to bury him.  I am not saying 
10 
that is necessarily true but that is the allegation he makes 
and 
I 
am 
saying, 
Chair, 
I 
challenge 
you 
and 
this 
Commission and its investigators who sit behind it whether 
they have gone as gung-ho as they have on the claims 
made by the earlier witnesses that I referred to and the 
claims he made and it is this Commission that can inform 
me that the claims that he made are being investigated and 
if that is done, as the Chair did about his presentation, I 
will be the first to say that ground is not good. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that  is fine.  You know, 
20 
last week, I think on Friday, the witness or least one of the 
witnesses – the only witness, I think, who was giving 
evidence was Mr Zuma’s former attorney, Mr Mantsha, and 
evidence had been given that affected him in relation to 
when he was Chairperson of Denel and evidence had been 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 61 of 160 
 
given from last year to the effect that certain executives 
were suspended at Denel and the board that he was 
chairing was involved and that they were suspended for no 
reason, it was part of getting rid of people who were not 
prepared to do certain wrong things and so on. 
 
So last year we tried a number of times to get Mr 
Mantsha to file an affidavit and respond to the allegations 
or evidence by Mr Saloojee, for example, and so on, but he 
did not.  So when he came to give evidence on Friday and 
then I think he came after – there may have been a 
10 
Regulation 10.6 directive issued - he then said they were 
dismissed for misconduct and then he said – put up a 
certain story about what they had done and I said, you 
know, I just wish he had come and responded last year 
because at that time we still had a lot of time to investigate 
what he was saying they were dismissed for, but he was 
now telling us towards the tail end of the last [indistinct] of 
the Commission, some of the investigators are gone, 
others are still happy to do whatever.  So sometimes there 
are challenges when things come late, but I am just 
20 
mentioning …[intervenes] 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, I assure you, I assure you as I 
did now, that this is not brought frivolously and also, may I 
place this for the record?  I think, Chair, you have had a 
difficult 
time 
because 
people 
do 
not 
cooperate 
with 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 62 of 160 
 
investigations naturally and, Chair, when we come and 
make these grounds, these are not sweeping grounds 
about the fact that in every respect – I think in 90% of this 
Commission it has done what it can in a very difficult 
political context.  I do not underestimate that.   
 
The point I am making is this, is that with the 
witness telling you what he did and with the circumstances 
I have told you, Chair, and I think, Chair, if you are frank 
with me, that undertaking, ruling of yours, to meet his 
doctors, I know you were reluctant but I think, Chair, you 
10 
missed a golden opportunity yourself, just like we have 
missed our golden opportunities because I think this belief 
that he does not want to come here and that all of these 
delays since September last year were because Mr Zuma is 
ducking and divings, others are even making attempts at 
history, that it is Stalingrad, but it is not that, Chair. 
 
And 
so 
we 
make 
that 
knowing 
all 
of 
those 
difficulties and, Chair, as I said, I still say today, this 
Commission has missed the opportunity to get – well, not 
missed, it is not the right word – the central issues in your 
20 
terms of reference, it is the Guptas and what is alleged to 
have happened and must be investigated and the centrality 
of the head of state then.   
 
Chair, you are going to finish this report with no 
version from the Guptas, right?  And I understand the legal 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 63 of 160 
 
issue that well, if you do not give me your version I will 
just to – but, sir, without the version of such people, I 
appreciate the fact that it weakens the Commission.  
Without Mr Zuma giving a version here in an environment 
that he trusts, the reports may be great, may be good, but 
it may not assist in going forward and it may open itself up 
to difficulties that we do not need.  
I have raised it with Mr Pretorius that, you know, if 
we were playing the Stalingrad, everyone thinks Stalingrad 
means a delay, Stalingrad was the shortest battle, it was 
10 
just fought strategically, is this.  If you blow us, today, you 
do not agree with us – as I have said, I have a mountain to 
climb – what happens?  Do we get Mr Zuma here as a 
guarantee?  No, no, if we are approached that way, we will 
just – even if we lose, we will review you, we will go as far 
as wherever and that is not helpful. 
If you force me to bring him here without the climate being 
created for him to believe that he is not being charged.   
Well, I put him there, Chair, and he will exercise his right 
to nothing and I think those two things as strategic as they 
20 
may be for me as a lawyer to get my client out of this place 
I 
think 
the 
country 
deserves 
the 
climate 
that 
can 
interrogate the subject matter without judging the people 
we already dislike, and I think those – that is the pattern I 
am giving without judging you, it is a pattern that I am 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 64 of 160 
 
giving not just to you, because you have investigators, you 
have evidence leaders who have their particular styles and 
prejudices and beliefs, and I am suggesting that there is a 
way to protect a process like this, because it is big, and so 
when Mr Zuma raises these issues about your comments 
some of your comments look mild in a situation where the 
person is not an accused, but I am going to take you to 
your comment when Barbara Hogan was here, Ms Barbara 
Hogan for instance.    
 
We set it out there in the paragraphs that are – but 
10 
eventually at some point you said this to Ms Hogan, we 
have this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So we are on comments now? 
ADV 
SIKHAKHANE: 
 
 
I 
am 
comments 
Chair, 
your 
comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Shall we take that as the third 
ground or what, the comments? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Ja, your comments.  Just your 
comments in general and the pattern of your comments and 
what apprehension they may raise. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   It is paragraph 53.2 for affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   It is 53 of the affidavit, point 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 65 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   So I am going to read it for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I am going to read the particular 
comment not the whole excerpt. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   With Ms Hogan having said this to 
you at some point, and I quote: 
“The President is a genial person we know that, I 
cannot put aside the fact that probably dealing with 
women 
who 
held 
views 
might 
have 
been 
an 
10 
uncomfortable experience for him but I was careful 
to be respectful all the way through.” 
And Chair after that you say this: 
“But on the face of it, it seems to me, and you are 
free to comment, it seems to me that unless you 
tells us something else that happened, that might 
have a bearing on this it seems to me that what you 
were told on the phone by the former President 
amounted to saying Mr Marora going to continue as 
CEO of Eskom and there was nothing really to be 
20 
done about as far as the President was concerned 
about the Board’s view that he had offered to resign 
and they had accepted that.” 
Chair I know that you said it is better to have the judge 
who tells what he thinks, and I accept that you may well 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 66 of 160 
 
say I express what I think on this issue.   
 
The problem with putting a proposition because it 
looks 
like 
a 
proposition 
from 
the 
Judge 
it 
is 
not 
volunteered by the witness, it is extracted out of the 
witness by the Chair, and so that proposition on its own 
gives the impression that the Chair has a particular 
concluded version or proposition to make to the witness.  
Now I appreciate the fact that you have a role to ask 
questions but I think it is in the nature of the questions and 
comments. 
 
10 
 
The second one ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well before you go to this is that the 
second one the passage or another passage?  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   No not on the part, we can deal with 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, you see I think what was 
happening here is I had listened to the witness, she had 
said certain things about what Mr Zuma had said to her in 
the telephone conversation and I sought to clarify from her 
whether my understanding of what she was telling me was 
20 
correct, and you will see that I see on the face of it this 
seems to me to be what you are saying but also it seems 
when she responds it is quite – seems important she does 
not say yes that is what I mean, she says that is one 
possibility certainly.  Another possibility is that – she puts 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 67 of 160 
 
another possibility, which might mean I sought to have 
clarification of what she meant and in responding she said 
well it could mean two things.  I just mentioned that 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   No Chair, I think you are correct, I 
think Chair these are not open and shut questions, but that 
is the danger of a presiding officer putting a proposition 
rather than – I will never fault Mr Pretorius for putting a 
proposition.   You are a very powerful man sitting there 
Chair and when you put a proposition to witnesses once 
10 
they assume, especially if it is a proposition once they 
assume that the Chair is with me here it is one of those 
things you can leave to the evidence leader, because that 
witness will latch on what they think is your proposition, is 
your predisposition and therefore I am not criticising Chair 
that as a blanket issue your comments are bad, I am 
saying these comments that are put as propositions open 
themselves to the risk of witnesses who come here to take 
chances sent by as 
political missiles of others 
are 
offshoots of a particular agenda, and when they see that 
20 
you put a proposition about the man they really want to see 
go down they may latch onto that and think that is the 
route they want to take because the Chair seems inclined 
and even if Chair it is not your intention and may I say this 
one of the difficult things about recusal is also that who 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 68 of 160 
 
are we to know your intentions. 
 
One of the things missing intellectually in the 
debate about recusal is how do we determine that someone 
can say you know what I am biased, so I did not come here 
to present expecting that answer to anybody, not because 
you have no integrity, because human beings have a very 
low capacity for self-reflection because we don’t see 
ourselves. 
 
So Chair I am saying that comment on its own, not 
with the background I have given, may look mild. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  The next one Chair you say did you 
get an impression that there might have been private 
meetings between the President and Mr Marora.  Chair we 
put that with the others because there again a proposition 
is put and it is a proposition in the context where this 
witness of course has come to tell you how bad Mr Zuma 
is.  None of them, they all have come to tell you that, all of 
them that they perfect is not, and so when you put that 
proposition you actually plant in the mind of a witness as 
20 
Chair what I said an understanding by that witness that a-
ha here is the inclination of the chair he thinks this, let me 
go there, and for a witness who is watching you who is 
accused about whom they are talking spewing all sorts of 
things from their moral high ground he sits believing 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 69 of 160 
 
reasonably I think that this is an engagement between you 
and 
people 
who 
are 
parroting 
a 
version 
that 
the 
Commission finds convenient. 
 
And then Chair she says of course exactly what I 
am saying, she says yes and that impression it is in 
paragraph, it says something, I forget which paragraph, it 
is just the example to say I underline that to show to you 
what 
political 
witnesses 
who 
come 
here 
before 
you 
because all of them are due to latch onto a proposition 
from you that they think is an inclination they have come to 
10 
give you, and then later Chair you say this to her, of 
course it is polite, you have to thank her, but we say this 
because we also have noticed that those witnesses were 
treated with a certain level of deference about what they 
say, and then you say this Chair to Ms Hogan right at the 
end, and I am going to move away from your engagement 
with her.   
 
Thank you very much Ms Hogan for those words, 
she had just praised that she appreciates it and thank you 
all for the remaining of these three days instead of one 
20 
that was envisage,. All sorts of things.    
 
And then Chair you say this to her, thank you very 
much Ms Hogan for those words and I don’t think that is 
our complaint and I think you on behalf of everybody in the 
Commission who all of whom appreciate your words.  I 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 70 of 160 
 
also, I have no doubt from the interactions that I received 
from ordinary South Africans every day, whether I am in a 
mall or in any public space, and many South Africans who 
happen to have their way of sending messages to me , the 
messages that I get from them are amazing.  The 
sentiments that you have expressed about the Commission 
I can assure you that there are shared by very, very 
ordinary South Africans.   
 
Of course a very great number of the South African 
population is Christian and so there are lots of people who 
10 
say we are praying for you.  Chair it goes on and on.  What 
is the complaint about this polite engagement.   Is the 
Chair having the context of your discussion with  her and 
what seems to be her inclination and your kind of 
consideration of the approval received from outside the 
four corners of this room itself appears, I will not use the 
word improper, appears irrelevant to say to this witness 
you thank because of the – how you are appreciated when 
you walk down the mall in all of those, and so read that 
whole 
paragraph 
without 
taking 
you 
Chair, 
we 
have 
20 
underlined it, the point we seek to make, we want to make 
is that that comment and the others we will refer you to 
Chair the next one is Mr Gordhan, paragraph 53.6, and we 
say it was more evident when Mr Gordhan was here, it was 
obvious that the Chairperson seemed to accept his bona 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 71 of 160 
 
fides and viewed him as a conveyer of universal truth 
about State Capture, and then Mr Zuma says in the 
affidavit I do not say this lightly but rely on the transcript 
which reveals that this disturbing deference to Mr Gordhan 
in particular where the Chair, the comment of the Chair to 
him: 
“Thank you, you may be seated.  Thank you very 
much.  Before Mr Pretorius begins I just want to 
thank you Minister Gordhan for coming forward to 
assist the Commission.  We have been making a 
10 
call to all South Africans who may have information 
about the matters that we are investigating to come 
forward and we have made a call to President, past 
ministers, deputy ministers, we are ...” 
And then at the end you say: 
“And we are grateful for that, and we are grateful 
that you also have come forward.  Thank you very 
much.” 
Viewed on its own it is not a problem, but you have said in 
that comment to him that there are people who have not 
20 
responded, including the President and so the comment to 
him, that defence to him and the comment that we made a 
call to the President is in line with what I said is false, that 
he does not want to come and therefore it gives that 
impression, and then you say to him ...[intervenes]  
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 72 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You refer to the President – oh – oh 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, you do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I think that must – well I am not sure 
but I am thinking it may have been presidents, meaning 
past ministers I am not sure but one may have to – I doubt 
that I meant a specific president, I doubt that. But 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair I won’t doubt your – but I am 
saying that is the risk we face. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja yes, ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   That I have to present to the very 
person, the only one who knows his intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Then Chair you say okay that 
paragraph appears to me, and you must tell me if you 
understand 
it 
differently, 
appears 
to 
be 
an 
acknowledgement by the ruling party that the leadership 
structure that it had up to that stage were failing to arrest 
corruption, and these are the practices that are mentioned 
20 
there, is that your understanding of the paragraph as we? 
 
Now this comment is similar to the one I was saying 
about Ms Hogan where you may – it is a question and I 
know maybe Chair you say if and you say the prima facie 
view but the fact of the matter I would like the Chair to 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 73 of 160 
 
read them together with an open mind and see what 
impression they give and then after at the end you say that 
now straight about we have no doubt here that which 
President you meant, unlike the other paragraph, you say 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   I take it from what you say in 
paragraph 34 last sentence in the event it would appear 
that he ignored this suggestion, and take that the former 
President did not articulate his views in regard to the 
10 
suggestion you made about what processes you were 
thinking ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry where are you reading now?  I 
want to check this time because of the reference to 
President ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes okay Chair let me give – if you 
go to paragraph 53.6 of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And go down to the comment 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay yes, now I see yes, yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And there can be no doubt which 
President you meant here.   You say I take it from what you 
say in paragraph 34, last sentence, in the event it would 
appear that he ignored this suggestion, I take it that former 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 74 of 160 
 
President did not articulate his views in regard to the 
suggestion you made about what process you were thinking 
should be followed, and then he says – and I am reading 
both because of what I say witnesses are likely to do when 
they think you are so inclined.    
 
Well in the event it was ignored I think, well at that 
stage, and then Mr Nene needs to tell you what followed 
after the elections.   Chair those two comments that 
exchange between you and Mr Gordhan of course he as 
much as you phrase it as a question to him but he sees an 
10 
opening about your inclination and I am not talking about 
your intention, he sees an opening in your comment about 
the President who is not there, and so that comment itself 
is phrased as proposition that may give – well that does 
give reasonable apprehension to the person and witness in 
the position of Mr Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course when one looks at excerpts or 
extracts from a transcript such as this it is important to 
have the whole context, because this would have been a 
witness, an exchange when a witness is on the witness 
20 
stand and that witness has put in an affidavit where he has 
told the story and it may be that a question is put in a 
certain way, because everybody understands what is 
written in the affidavit, so it may well be important to have 
that affidavit in order to have a full context of the extracts. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 75 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   We do Chair, we do.  I think Chair 
should be comfortable that we have read and we followed 
and we watched that interaction, so we are not taking this 
out of context and as I say I want the Chair to look at them 
later with an open mind and connect them and say they will 
be that the Chair, because only Chair knows his intentions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Will tell me that is not what I 
intended and I have no way to dispute that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
10 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And then Chair that interaction with 
him I would like the Chair to go through it, I don’t want to 
read these excerpts because what I say – what I submit 
they indicate is a mind that is inclined to agree with a 
particular witness about another who is not there, and 
Chair as you keep saying to me correctly, but I need to find 
out what is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair I am asking you to do 
something very difficult, it is difficult for me, it is difficult 
20 
for you, is that as I said I am not asking you to go to the 
extremes, in those comments and those propositions you 
will find that – because you are human, you will find that in 
the heat of things and the outrage that you feel about the 
testimony because you are human there is a line you may 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 76 of 160 
 
cross, and the crossing of that line is not because you are 
a bad person or you intend punishing people, it is because 
you are outraged by a particular – and I have seen you 
outraged in these proceedings, justifiably so sometimes, so 
I think Chair what I am asking you to do is to look 
objectively at your comments from the position of someone 
who is accused number one whether we like it or not in 
these proceedings. 
 
This was started to get him and that is how he sees 
it, and so his position is important for the Chair to take into 
10 
account, then take into account those who love him and 
those who hate him because they are pursuing something 
else, and then Chair you will see that paragraph 53.7 is 
another quote where you put your view, expressed as a 
question you say with the involvement of the presidency 
right at the bottom, at the foot of the page, of the 
presidency in the appoint or reappointment of members of 
boards, SOE’s have been an normal thing, is that a normal 
thing or not?  
 
Now Chair that question as I said contains what 
20 
outrages 
you, 
sounds 
like 
the 
suggestion 
that 
the 
Presidency would interfere right, because we are talking 
about accusations that were made before you that Mr Zuma 
was interfering with Boards of SOE’s, so seen in that 
context he views this comment and many others as the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 77 of 160 
 
Chair ’s inclination to agree with these witnesses and that 
we are disinclined to agree with the counter version 
because Chair I think there is a counter version in society, 
there is a counter narrative that makes the entire body 
politic and this process which is to help policy making must 
not be determined by the dominant views of what in South 
Africa is a dominant class and its media and their views, is 
that if you want to get out of this morass of policy 
uncertainty, which is what your task is, is our ability to 
thoroughly interrogate different narratives that are out in 
10 
society and how they lead to fraud that you are to 
investigation, 
corruption 
and 
this 
thing 
called 
State 
Capture.   I keep referring to it as a separate issue Chair, 
because as a matter of political science all states are 
captured, all states.  The reason here is a contest between 
clusters in society even here is that they are contesting to 
capture the State, some for good reasons, others for bad 
reasons, so State Capture is a notion that is weaponised 
comes as a notion that is designed at a time Mr Zuma must 
go, but what the Chair is tasked to do is to cut the veil, go 
20 
beyond the different classes that contest the State since 
its inception is to look at this State as we speak now is 
captured, this State, particular one, beyond Mr Zuma, long 
gone and elsewhere in Ukraine but what the Chair must 
look at is what forces, what do these forces do with the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 78 of 160 
 
State, what is the fraud, and what is the corruption and I 
think 
these 
comments 
demonstrate 
a 
mind 
that 
has 
accepted a particular version that Mr Zuma facilitated 
wrongful capture of the State, that – whose intention was 
to – was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us assume that they reflect an 
acceptance of certain evidence that has been given, would 
you accept that there would be nothing wrong with that if 
that acceptance is provisional, in other words until I hear 
the other side, until I hear what has happened, in other 
10 
words well maybe this is – maybe this version without 
contradictory evidence may be it is too – but I will wait 
until I have heard all the evidence and I can change my 
mind, I am open, in other words isn’t the fundamental thing 
whether whatever you think of a certain witness evidence 
at a particular time that you must at least keep your mind 
open and be prepared to change whatever you thought 
once there is good contradictory evidence or arguments 
and so on.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair I accept that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am just posing it ja.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   No Chair intellectually as a way of 
engaging people I would accept that you may hear one 
version and agree with it and then hear another, but here 
is where I part ways with your answer, it is like Ms Jones 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 79 of 160 
 
Ms Mkhiza was talking about, who is sitting in court 
listening to a judge talking about the fact that she wants 
maintenance.  It may well be that when you make a 
comment that you think she is a gold digger, you will then 
say to her you may persuade me otherwise, but it is no 
comfort from a judge to make that comment and say, and 
give the explanation you are giving me, that no sit 
comfortably there, I am calling you a gold digger for now 
but when you come you may well tell me you are not.   
 
That explanation Chair it is sound the explanation 
10 
you give, but in an environment where you sit in that 
powerful position with people who sit here, others is 
heroes and others is accused, those accused persons do 
not feel that statement you make the way you say it 
because for them it is not an intellectual engagement, they 
are being accused. 
 
And so I want to Chair, I know it is your explanation 
but I want you to look at it and see whether a judge can 
give that answer for commenting flippantly to someone and 
no but I was still going to change my mind, I don’t think it 
20 
is a legitimate explanation to a witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, of course if we go back to our 
earlier example, much earlier before tea break and of 
course when you make, I mean how you make a comment 
is also important you know.  If you talk about – if you 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 80 of 160 
 
contrast that example of a judge or magistrate who says 
you know women are gold diggers then you have another 
one who actually thinks like that inside but doesn’t say it.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Both are wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that ja I guess one needs to be 
sensitive. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One needs to be sensitive to all of these 
things. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair you have come to the nub, 
10 
maybe you have expanded without noticing, unfortunately 
you are no precedent.  Maybe you have created precedent 
for this nebulas concept, sensitivity, because when we sit 
where we sit it was not a flippant comment when I said 
there is something intellectually dishonest about the fact 
that precedent about this subject matter we get it from 
people who are the subject of our criticism, they tell us 
how to criticise them, and so Chair you have come to the 
nub of what I think reasonable apprehension of bias stems 
from.  It stems from a need for sensitivity and the need for 
20 
sensitivity Chair comes from a recognition of the tenets of 
natural justice and that justice must not be done but they 
must also be seen to be done, and so a witness may well 
Chair think of what you say differently if it is said by an 
evidence leader, so I am saying Chair some of the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 81 of 160 
 
propositions in your difficult job you are doing have been 
propositions that a small person sitting – and when I say 
small people will say Mr Zuma is not small, Chair lawyers 
we think our environment is easy, because we are here 
every day, everyone who is not a lawyer is small in an 
environment like this, intimidating.  It is only nice to those 
who see their enemies squirm, but to a person who is an 
ordinary citizen to sit in this room is no ordinary task and 
so sensitivity I wish you could bring that as an element 
that really, really pricks, that should guide how we deal 
10 
with the apprehension of bias, that judges must be 
sensitive even if they are correct, and all of these things 
you say here by the way Chair, I am not suggesting they 
are wrong, I am not suggesting you shouldn’t believe them, 
but we don’t express everything we believe.  It is the 
reason we don’t tell our grandmother her cookies are not 
nice, we just don’t want to hurt them. 
 
So sensitivity is an important component of how to 
deal with small people in a powerful environment with a 
Judge. 
20 
 
Chair all of those codes, because Chair if – I don’t 
want to – I assume you have read them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have read them, I can assure you.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And Chair what I want to do so that I 
don’t take you through each one of them, I didn’t come 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 82 of 160 
 
here to tell you, you spoke, is that that entire area in which 
we traverse your comments I invite the Chairperson to look 
at them the way you have just phrased why there is a need 
for sensitivity in an environment of this nature. 
 
And Chair I want to suggest that we ask you to 
recuse yourself, mindful of the crisis it would create for 
this important task, and I said to you we have two reliefs in 
our 
notice 
of 
motion, 
the 
second 
relief 
may 
seem 
contradictory to the first one because of course we always 
put this as lawyers further and alternative relief.  Chair it 
10 
is put more sincerely than we do it as lawyers out there, 
because 
we 
– 
when 
I 
say 
we 
I 
think 
my 
client 
acknowledges this – he takes this stance reluctantly, he 
takes it because this place, even when he is ill did not 
seem to believe him, it did not, they wanted to let’s see the 
doctor and so in a way it may not have been the intention 
of the Commission, but when you say to someone now you 
say you are ill I want to check your doctor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think we must talk a little bit about 
that because I saw in correspondence and the affidavit that 
20 
I am accused of having disbelieved or not believed that Mr 
Zuma was not well, and yet my recollection that I never 
said anything that suggested that I didn’t believe it   Your 
referred earlier on to the fact that I reluctantly agreed to 
the offer to meet with the leader of his medical team.  That 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 83 of 160 
 
reluctance I think was mainly about whether we should go 
that far, but my understanding was that the – Mr Zuma and 
his legal team wanted that to happen, but I expressed my 
reluctance even when we came back, we discussed in 
chambers but when we came back in the open hearing I 
pressed that reluctance but I said I’d accept it. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Yes Chair, no let me do this, let me 
say that I am – I don’t think it will be fair to accuse you of 
having disbelieved him, I think if that was put in some – I 
don’t think it is as clear as that, I think Chair it is a series 
10 
of things in how he is treated when he says he is here.  Mr 
Zuma won’t be believed even I say he collapsed here, they 
will say he faked it, and so in a way you are dealing with 
the a situation where I think that reluctance of yours to do 
this, as much as it may have been misinterpreted, was that 
it was clear that saying Mr Zuma isn’t ill does not convince 
a judge or those in the forum and therefore that offer was 
made to say you know we don’t know if judges don’t 
believe when a former head of State says he is ill, when a 
doctor puts up something to say so, from the State, well 
20 
they may as well have a meeting but I accept Chair that on 
its own I wouldn’t like to question that because you did say 
you were doing it reluctantly and I think you are reluctant – 
I would like to view as having been in good faith rather 
than in bad faith, but Chair you will ...[intervenes]  
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 84 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   And Chair so all of these comments 
that I want the Chair to look at, I raised them because I 
think you have helped me with the case now, that I think a 
lot of them, my submission is that a lot of the comments 
you made about which Mr Zuma complain may not be 
because maliciousness does not fit but may have been 
insensitive in circumstances of a witness who has come to 
what he believes is a slaughterhouse, reasonably so by the 
way. 
10 
 
And so Chair I am not raising this lightly, I am 
raising, I made an example earlier Chair the difficulty of 
representing Mr Zuma and for him to be believed a judge in 
this country has questioned my integrity in court for 
representing a client, it never happens to a white lawyer, 
but it happens to me and I am saying that on its own 
creates circumstances for him that he is disbelieved.   I 
have just told this Commission now that our second 
remedy, I mean relief demonstrates that this is an act of 
frustration with the process, but it is no act of defiance of 
20 
you Chair or this country and its citizens who need to know 
what it seeks is to correct an environment that I think has 
been distorted by your comments and sometimes the 
excitement that I have seen when people cross-examine 
someone they think is a scum, and I think an environment 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 85 of 160 
 
must be created for you because Chair I don’t care about 
the people who sit in this commission behind the scenes.  
When this Commission is reviewed Chair us who are close 
to you, who have known you rise as a brother you will be 
criticised, not them, not the agenda they are pushing 
behind the scenes, ethnic of racial, it will be you who will 
be criticised and they will run away and we will have to 
defend you, and the point I am making is this, I am asking 
you Chair to look at your comments but the second relief 
we seek there I am asking you in your thinking about how 
10 
do we remedy this situation I said to Mr Pretorius I am 
prepared to sit with him and look at how Mr Zuma can have 
an environment here where the citizens who deserve his 
version can hear it and I would like you Chair to creatively 
together with all of us look at that remedy and see even if 
you accept that some of your comments may not have been 
appropriate or may not have been sensitive I am asking 
you in that second relief to look at creating an environment 
not just for Mr Zuma maybe for others to come here and 
feel they are not accused, and that is why I said to Mr 
20 
Pretorius when lawyers sit and talk about remedy we do 
that because we want to assist the judge to come to some 
sort of conclusion that is just and equitable. 
 
As I said earlier I can sit down now Chair and you 
blow me and I will review you and it goes nowhere, it will 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 86 of 160 
 
be the end of Mr Zuma or I bring him here and tell him to 
sit there and say nothing and that is a stalemate I can do, 
but it is unconstructive and I want you to look at the 
second relief and see having considered the things we 
have said and Chair I would like lastly to look at the 
statement you made this morning and see whether it is 
important for me and my client to look at this version, and 
then we will tell you probably tomorrow or any other time. 
 
Chair I thank you for giving me this time, it is a 
difficult task, probably no one has said to us the second in 
10 
command in the judiciary, judge you are doing a good job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I can tell you that in two and a half 
months time I will be finishing 24 years on the bench and 
this is the first time an application is brought for me to 
recuse myself, but it is brought by you, but you know there 
is nothing wrong with an application for recusal when 
people feel aggrieved, it is a remedy that is available and 
should be considered so – but I was just saying that in 24 
years this has not happened, but there is always a first 
time. 
20 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair in 20 years of practice I 
haven’t been asked to ask someone I know, I come from 
the same village with, to recuse themselves, so I thank you 
for giving us the opportunity and those are our submissions 
and we are pleased to have discussions.  There is an 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 87 of 160 
 
affidavit we gave Chair to the extent that we take the 
technical approach about whose version in terms of 
Plascon Evans should prevail, I will hear Mr – it is there, 
but I would like some time to look at your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine, we are ten to one, 
thank you Mr Sikhakhane, thank you very much.  
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Thank you so much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, thank 
you. 
 Yes Mr 
Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair may I suggest that we take 
10 
the long adjournment now and come back when you direct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay it is ten to one, let us take the 
lunch adjournment and then come back at two. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure you are ready Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes I am Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am going to ask Mr Sikhakhane to 
come back so that I can raise certain legal issues with him 
and then he will come back later. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Yes Chair. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 88 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry to bring you back when you 
thought you were done. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  I thought I had a second chance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I noticed that you paid particular attention 
to your prayer number 2. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Notice of Motion.  May – I have 
some questions about prayer number 1 and this is the 
question and I think from your address I could tell that you 
do expect me to ask certain questions about it.   
10 
The question is whether as a matter of law recusal 
for the Chairperson of a commission who is the sole member 
of the commission is competent?  So some commissions you 
have got two or three members of the commission as a 
panel.   
It may be that if there is a witness who feels that a 
particular member of that panel is biased that that witness 
may apply for the recusal of that member for the duration of 
his or her evidence.  But even there it may be that it cannot 
be done but maybe it is a better situation.  But where you 
20 
are dealing with a situation such as that of this commission 
where the commission consists of one member – sole 
member if I recuse myself what happens? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair I did not think it was my decision 
but it is fine.  I think Chair it is a difficulty you had when you 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 89 of 160 
 
were asked here about Advocate Soni.  You were exactly in 
my situation because he did not know whether to ask him to 
sit down then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Or wait for him to make a judgement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Well let me start here.  That is why we 
have spoken about how this commission was formed.  Is that 
Chair ordinarily I am surprised that a commission of this 
nature in this country probably the biggest after the TRC has 
10 
– only has one person.  That on its own was a political 
blunder dare I say but this was made by Judges. 
 
I think to have one person in a matter that is so 
vulnerable to contradictions like the one that has arisen 
should not have been done.  As I said earlier the solution to 
something like that is that it would – it would really relate to 
the evidence that – I mean – that relates to Mr Zuma. 
 
I do not know what Chair would you do?  But it is 
competent there is – I cannot be stopped from raising a 
recusal application simply because you and the President do 
20 
not know what to do with – let us say you find in my favour.  
It is truly something you and the President must look at as to 
– let us say I am correct on my grounds. 
 
But that is why Chair – so I do not know what you 
would do.  But it does not nullify my grounds if they are 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 90 of 160 
 
good.   
 
We put number 2 there Chair out of – I think it is not 
mine it is Mr Zuma himself who puts that because he says I 
do not want to destroy this commission.  Is there no way 
where this can be done and all of this? 
 
So we put number 2 purely out of his own sense of 
responsibility and I think it solves that problem Chair we can 
work around how do we make sure that the close to R1 
billion paid here for this is not for nothing.   
 
So I think Chair I do not know the answer but what 
10 
you and the President would do if I am good on my grounds 
and I do not want to offer the solution. 
 
But I think if you looked further in the reliefs we seek 
you will see that we have not shut the door.  The stalemate I 
spoke about is a stalemate that I can do for my client.  And it 
is a stalemate but we do not want to go there. And so I think 
Chair in crafting your order even if we are right or even if we 
are wrong I would still plead with you that craft it in a way 
that does not sink this commission.  That is my answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
20 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But legally my recusal cannot be 
incompetent because you and the President do not know 
what to do if you are wrong and I am right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see it might not be a question of 
me and the President particularly in the context of this 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 91 of 160 
 
commission.  Maybe the same issues would arise with 
another 
commission 
but 
this 
particular 
one 
because 
remember that the – the remedial action the Public Protector 
said that the commission which would investigate all of these 
issues must be chaired by a Judge selected I think solely by 
the Chief Justice obviously appointed by the President. 
 
Now you said earlier on that you referred to the fact 
that maybe the commission should not have consisted of one 
member because of its importance. 
 
When I – when I – after I had been appointed I 
10 
applied my mind to that issue to say this is a very big 
commission should I request the President to appoint others 
members maybe one or preferably two members of the 
commission so that I am not the only one.  And when I 
considered whether to make such a recommendation or 
request the problem that I foresee was that if there were two 
members added it could result into a situation where when 
the report is made the member of the commission that had 
been selected in accordance with the remedial action of the 
Public Protector could be overruled by the members of the 
20 
commission who had never been contemplated by their 
remedial action and that could cause problems. 
 
And then of course there was the question if you 
make it too there could also be challenges.  And of course 
there is the issue that we are not just dealing with what the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 92 of 160 
 
remedial action of the Public Protector said there is an order 
of court which reinforced that remedial action. 
 
So there is an order of court effectively which says – 
which said the President must appoint a Judge selected by 
the Chief Justice.  So if I were to for argument sake say I 
think Mr Sikhakhane has made out a very good case for 
recusal I must recuse myself that means that there is a 
vacuum or do I say okay what should happen?  Should 
another Judge be appointed to hear Mr Zuma’s evidence and 
then the question is how would that work because I am the 
10 
one who has heard other witnesses who may have implicated 
him.  How does it happen now if another Judge is going to 
hear his evidence responding to those witnesses who were 
heard by me?  Will that Judge have to re-hear those – it 
becomes complex. 
 
And of course the President even the appointment of 
that Judge who must appoint that Judge because if the 
President appoints there might be a question whether that is 
proper given that the remedial action did not have that or 
that is not proper.  There may be all kinds of argument. 
20 
 
So there are those issues and I think part of what you 
have been saying you have said to me is; is that it may be 
that a recusal would collapse the commission. 
 
So you – you then say to me but Chair if my client 
has got good grounds to complain that you may be biased; 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 93 of 160 
 
that he fears that you may have made up your mind on 
certain issues what happens? 
 
It may be that the answer in circumstances such as 
these is this one and one would accept that it might not be 
the best answer.  It may well be and you must just indicate 
what you – what your submissions are that in a situation 
such as this you are expected as the aggrieved witness to 
complain later in a review application because if you 
complain later in a review application maybe if you are 
successful the court can set aside findings that relate to you 
10 
if nobody else has complained the other findings stand. 
 
I am just thinking aloud and I would like us to look at 
it.  I know you have thought about the issue. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why I – I want to benefit from 
… 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Ja.  Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Your submissions. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Let me start with the last one that I 
may review later therefore there is that option.  The reason I 
20 
would not accept that option not me I am saying it would not 
be acceptable in a legal process like this is that you making 
your problem mine in the sense that because there is a 
conundrum my grounds to come before you must be regarded 
as incompetence simply to make things convenient for you. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 94 of 160 
 
 
I do not think that would be the best way to look at it 
but it is an option available.  But it does not help because it 
will not deal with the problem and I have no desire that this 
commission be collapsed because it is very important. 
 
The other thing Chair what you are asking me now is 
truly what I have been trying to say to Judges to no avail.  
There 
is 
something 
wrong 
with 
how 
this 
thing 
was 
established.  It was not thought through.  It was politically 
motivated in the thinking and the challenges you and me 
face now are challenges caused by the fact that those who 
10 
thought about this thought about sinking Mr Zuma and 
nothing else. 
 
And I think if we get those out of the way one of the 
things to be done for a process like this like we would in a 
court if we are responsible is to say, maybe in some respects 
Chair I am correct in my grounds.  And maybe in some 
respects I am not so correct.  Could we collapse this 
commission simply because it is a draw between you and 
me?  And maybe the – let me call it the third way. 
 
Maybe the third way is to look at – because this is 
20 
not a court you can craft things to save this as we – as we 
want is what can we do to ensure that Mr Zuma not accounts 
because it is wrong to say a commission is a place of 
accountability.  Professors say this out there; they have 
never been inside a court.   
 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 95 of 160 
 
 
Basically it is not a place of accountability but it is a 
place of explaining to the investigator that is you and if we 
create an environment in which and we can talk about this – 
I can talk to my client.  What is the best way of doing this in 
such a way that we are responsible in the national interest 
not thinking politically?  And I think – may I make this – 
because Chair we never did – we have been accused – I 
heard you saying we did in five things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Can I tell you Chair that we were on 
10 
page 200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Of the submissions to you when he hit 
Covid; lawyers were changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And the situation but basically we not 
here to disrupt this place.  We were willing – we can produce 
500 pages for you of his perspective but we had to place 
before you the fact that we believe that in some of your 
comments and the environment that we think are politically 
20 
driven not by you but other people.  You create an 
environment where politics contaminates a legal process.   
 
And so if there is a way of doing – and you will craft 
it you are good at this – you are better than me at this – at 
crafting what alternative just and equitable way forward can 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 96 of 160 
 
be created that Mr Zuma can cope with if he is right on his 
grounds.   
 
Of course if he is wrong on his grounds he will blow 
us.  So I think that relief be Chair tries to deal with this 
problem that was always going to arise when a commission 
is created for the purposes it was created.  
 
And so I put it here to this commission that it is a 
discussion I have raised it with Mr Pretorius; I have raised a 
bit with you on remedy that let us look – none of us are 
perfect in this process and so let us – if we look at it that 
10 
way there may be possibility of creating an environment in 
which submissions can be made if you heed that. 
 
But if I am right on my grounds on all of my grounds 
of course I would like to [00:17:17] them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Relief number 2 is truly –  
CHAIRPERSON:  [Inaudible talking over one another]. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  But it is not because the first one is 
20 
incompetent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And it cannot be incompetent because 
you are – you have a conundrum.  There has got to be 
another reason why the relief is incompetent rather than to 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 97 of 160 
 
say I do know what to do? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  So maybe let me 
hear Mr Pretorius and it may well be that after I have heard 
everybody 
there 
might 
be 
a 
need 
for 
a 
discussion 
irrespective of what would happen with the application. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair thank you yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Two discussions will happen Chair as I 
10 
have said I really need to take instructions about your earlier 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And all of that.  Probably tomorrow I 
will know but I will try not to waste any time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  And then there may be a discussion 
about what relief gets us out of here as lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Because we here now we do not know 
20 
what political people were thinking when they created this 
but we here now we have got to give this process the 
integrity it deserves without disrupting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you Mr Sikhakhane.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Thank you Chair. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 98 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Firstly in response to the discussion 
that has now taken place I would obviously like to think 
about it and 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Prepare an answer for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But our initial view is clear Chair that 
10 
if there are grounds for your recusal you must recuse 
yourself.  There is no halfway in these circumstances where 
you can negotiate how to proceed with a particular witness 
despite the fact that that witness has proved or shown that 
you are guilty of such bias as to warrant recusal.  I am afraid 
in that sense if you are however guilty of bias then there 
may be room for dealing from a practical point of view but we 
would need to think very carefully about treating a witness 
differently from another witness simply because they might 
be implicated or have fears about what your final findings 
20 
might be. 
 
So let me think about that and we will come to you 
Chair. 
 
Chair I am afraid there is another matter that I must 
deal with and that is the reply that was served on us this 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 99 of 160 
 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Pretorius.  I am not sure – not 
completely sure that you are right and Mr Sikhakhane is also 
right when you say if a witness has shown that in this case 
there is a reasonable apprehension of bias I should recuse 
myself.  That it always follows it cannot be otherwise.   
 
The reason why I am raising that is that we – we all 
know that there are circumstances where somebody – a 
Judge who is disqualified from sitting is allowed to sit 
because there is no other one who will not be disqualified to 
10 
sit the doctrine of necessity. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so I am – I just want to raise that 
because I do not want you or Mr Sikhakhane to necessarily 
think that I accept the proposition that if we reach a point 
where it was to be said that there are reasonable grounds.  
It seems to me on the fact of it and now I am talking 
principle – it seems to me that you may well have a case 
where you say well you have to sit conflicted as you are if 
you talking about conflict and you just have to do your best 
20 
to be fair.  I mean you – we – we know cases where judges 
hear cases dealing with legislation; dealing with their own 
salaries where they are all conflicted because this legislation 
is about their benefits.  But there is nobody else whoever 
hears the case has to be a judge.  So they have to do the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 100 of 160 
 
best they can to – to be fair and to disregard their own 
interests and give judgments. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we are not here dealing with 
the conflict of interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  We dealing with a notion of situation 
where it has been shown that you are guilty of bias in 
relation to central issues Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Let me put it this way.  Subject to the 
10 
doctrine of necessity and we will address you on the doctrine 
of necessity because it is part of our approach and it is in 
our heads of argument.  That is a separate issue. 
 
But certainly the solution cannot be given the 
principles that apply it cannot be that you can then negotiate 
with a particular witness in a particular situation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Leave out negotiate.  Leave out negotiate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well you do not negotiate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But that is the invitation.  The 
20 
invitation Chair is let us talk about a different solution other 
than your recusal on the basis that you are guilty of bias in 
respect of that particular witness.  For us we have difficulty 
with that proposition but we will deal with it in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  No that is fine. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 101 of 160 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Because there are – there is not one 
person with an interest in the proceedings that are before 
you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  There are hundreds and there are 
thousands and any one of them might come and say but you 
were conflicted you proceeded and you treated that witness 
with some special dispensation notwithstanding that you 
accepted that you were guilty of bias in respect of him. 
 
It raises all sorts of problems for a later review which 
10 
you have been told Chair is coming.  In any event Chair may 
I move on?   We will address you properly on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And we do not act or take issue with 
the principle of necessity that even though you may be 
conflicted but that is a matter of general application 
involving or not necessarily one witness who complains of 
bias. 
 
Chair we were served with a replying affidavit this 
morning.  My learned friend said we do not have to worry 
20 
about it but I am afraid unless it is withdrawn we do have to 
worry about it because in it the applicant makes allegations 
firstly that the secretary is not authorised to depose to the 
affidavit and the legal team is not authorise to intervene in 
this matter.  So that – there are two allegations. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 102 of 160 
 
 
One that and if I may refer you; do you have it before 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to paragraph 14 line 4 takes 
issue with the fact that the legal team is defending this 
application.  It says: 
“The fact that they have installed themselves 
as my opponents disqualifies them from 
performing the functions expected of them 
leading evidence.” 
10 
 
Now whether that is without merit or with merit is 
something that we can address. 
 
The allegation is made in paragraph 15 that the 
second respondent has no legal standing. 
 
Then 
paragraph 
23 
complains 
that 
the 
second 
respondent was assisted by the legal team. 
 
Paragraph 28 it is denied that the second respondent 
that is the secretary has any authority whatsoever to depose 
to the answering affidavit and is challenged to provide 
authority. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the whole concept of respondent in 
this application … 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well the second respondent was 
cited as a respondent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well both the first respondent and second I 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 103 of 160 
 
did not raise this with Mr Sikhakhane because it did not 
occur but at a practical level it might not mean anything you 
know.  My understanding is that if you bring a review 
application for a – an application for recusal before the 
particular presiding officer that precedent will say it is not a 
respondent.   You do not cite them as a respondent.  You cite 
them a respondent when you go on review to set aside their 
decision not to recuse themselves.   
 
Of course the secretary I am not sure… 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Well Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why would – why they would come in. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  In essence if I may go on to 
paragraph 82 it says: 
“That neither the second respondent – well 
the second respondent has no basis or 
authority 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
recusal 
application.” 
 
And then paragraph 89 it was neither for the second 
respondent nor the legal team to respond to the recusal 
application. 
20 
 
Chair the basis – as a matter of fact both the 
secretary and the legal team have been given instructions by 
yourself to deal with the matter in the way it is being dealt 
and perhaps that should be placed on record that may deal 
with the situation. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 104 of 160 
 
 
My fear is that if the situation is not dealt with and 
you then rely on statements made without authority in the 
answering affidavit and you rely on submissions placed 
before you by the legal team then there may be a problem if 
it turns out that their status to deal with the matter before 
you is not clarified. 
 
So I raise the matter so that it can therefore be 
clarified either by a statement by yourself that you direct us 
to act as we have done as you have already done as a 
matter of fact and clarify the matter or Mr Sikhakhane who 
10 
says that we need not have worried about the affidavit can 
just withdraw the allegations in the affidavit and we can 
proceed.  But I do think the matter needs attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I do not want it to be brought up at a 
later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Not having been dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I think proceed and Mr 
Sikhakhane will still come back and reply so he can indicate 
20 
what his position is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So then, do we have your assurance, 
both the secretary, so I can rely on the answering affidavit, 
and the legal team that we are acting under your direction? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 105 of 160 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, having listened carefully to my 
learned friend, whose submissions before you ranged from 
detailed submissions of fact and reference to the record, 
through to allegations of political conspiracies and the like. 
 
Fortunately, our approach is that the law will provide an 
answer.  Fortunately, in situations like these, however 
contested and by whatever extreme views they may be 
contested on either side, the law does provide an answer 
10 
and we will deal with it by reference to legal principles and 
facts.   
 
At the outset Chair, listening to my learned friend in his 
address.  It was difficult where we need to draw the line 
between what the case being brought before you for recusal 
was and what the case was not. 
 
First it was clear that – and it is necessary to draw that 
line because I think in attempting to draw that line and to 
understand where the case of the applicant lies in respect of 
that line, there may be an answer to this application. 
20 
 
Firstly, it was no indication of actual bias.  As I 
understood my learned friend.  He did not say as a matter of 
fact you are bias.  He did not doubt that – the applicant does 
not doubt your integrity.   
 
On the contrary Chair, he insists that the recusal 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 106 of 160 
 
application is brought precisely because he believes you as 
the Chair has the capacity and the integrity to, here on out, 
to hear contrary arguments and to come to a fair decision. 
 
In other words, you have, on the version of the 
applicant, the ability to be persuaded by argument by facts 
put before you notwithstanding what it might be said your 
views have been, as expressed on the record. 
 
Secondly Chair and crucially, it is not being alleged that 
at the end of the day the Chairperson will not be open to 
persuasion.  That is not part of the case.   
10 
 
It is not being alleged that you are not open-minded in 
your approach to the evidence and you may not been 
persuaded, in good faith, to come to a particular conclusion 
one or another. 
 
In fact, as we understand the argument, that claim has 
been disavowed.  It was unequivocally stated in my learned 
friend’s address that there is no allegation that you have 
pre-judged the matter. 
 
On the contrary.  As I understand the address.  You have 
been reassured that the applicant has no doubt that you are 
20 
able to be even-handed and impartial in your assessment of 
the evidence. 
 
The problem is, says the applicant:  From what I have 
seen and heard, I have an apprehension that I will not be 
treated fairly and I have an apprehension that my views will 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 107 of 160 
 
be rejected and other views will be accepted in their stead. 
 
And that is something different Chair.  That series of 
submissions and concessions as a matter of law, takes the 
case below the bar for a recusal application because that set 
of allegations does not pass the test. 
 
The apprehension of adverse findings, the reaction to 
comments from the record, is not relevant in the assessment 
of bias Chair.   The test is not in what you have said.   
 
The test is, has or will your conduct show that you 
cannot bring an impartial mind to bear on the evidence?  
10 
That is the test. 
 
In other words, before you will be able to recuse 
yourself Chair, you must be satisfied that you cannot, and it 
has been shown that you cannot, and it has been alleged 
that you cannot bring an impartial mind to bear on all the 
evidence, once you have assessed all the evidence. 
 
It is not an enough to say, for an applicant to say:  In my 
possession as a victim of a conspiracy, I fear.  That is not 
enough.  And I will come to the detail of that in due course. 
 
So whether a reasonable person might apprehend that 
20 
you might make adverse findings, given what you have said 
on the record, does not pass the test.   
 
So Chair, the test which has been stated in the 
authorities is clear.  It is:  Will you or will you not bring an 
impartial mind to bear, a mind open to persuasion by the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 108 of 160 
 
evidence?  Ultimately, Chair. 
 
When you have heard the evidence, all the versions, 
including the versions of the former President.  That has not 
been alleged and on the papers, nor do I understand it as 
having been alleged in the argument. 
 
So in the SACCAWU case upon which my learned friend 
relied Chair.  It was said by the Constitutional Court: 
“Absolute neutrality is something of a shimmer in 
the judicial context.  This is because judges are 
human.   
10 
They are unavoidable the product of their life 
experiences 
and 
the 
perspective 
thus 
derived 
inevitable and distinctively informed each judge’s 
performance of his or her judicial duties but callous 
neutrality which is the standard (of which is being 
demanded of you Chair), stands in contrast to 
judicial impartiality which is the test.   
So impartiality, importantly, is that quality of open-
mindedness, open-minded readiness to persuasion 
without unfitting adherence to either party or to the 
20 
judge’s 
own 
predilections, 
preconceptions 
and 
personal view.   
Impartiality, thus, requires that judges will be able to 
disabuse their minds of any irrelevant personal 
believes of dispositions.” 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 109 of 160 
 
 
Again, not alleged.  Again, certainly not shown on the 
papers.  And as I understand my learned friend’s argument, 
not put before you. 
 
So 
the 
plan 
before 
you 
Chair 
is 
not 
that 
the 
Chairperson’s mind is made up and not open to persuasion.  
It is not been said to you Chair that what you have said is 
not open to being persuaded that you can change your mind.   
 
If that is the case, the test will of recusal is not met.  In 
that case, there is no ground of the reasonable apprehension 
of bias but merely an apprehension by the applicant that 
10 
adverse findings may be made against him. 
 
We will deal with the detail in relation to the tests and 
where the bar is and if the case put before you actually 
reaches that bar or not 
 
Chair, you have before you our written submissions but 
before going to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not aware that I do have.  Are 
they here? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, I am just told you do not have 
Chair.  I presume that you would have been given.  It looks 
20 
like everybody else has been given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do I have Mr Sikhakhane’s ones as well 
because I saw him reading from a notebook.  I assumed he 
did not have any but I do not know.  Mr Sikhakhane, do you 
have them? 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 110 of 160 
 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Chair, I am so sorry.  We do.  Okay.  I 
will leave a copy for the chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.   
ADV SIKHAKHANE:   Yes, I will leave a copy for the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.  Yes, 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In the first 
section of those heads of argument we summarise what the 
contentions of the legal team are in this matter. 
 
The first point is that the burden rests on the applicant 
10 
to show bias or reasonable apprehension of bias.  It is the 
law, as my learned friend has conceded, a heavy burden.   
 
Secondly Chair, the test for bias is objective.  It is not 
what the applicant fears.  It is not what the applicant thinks.  
It is what a reasonable observer would reasonable conclude.  
Two hurdles to overcome in relation to reasonability. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think SARFU says:  Reasonable, 
objective and informed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On the correct text, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the correct... 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So it is a reasonable observer 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...making a reasonable conclusion, 
looking at the correct facts.  It is not based on conjecture, 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 111 of 160 
 
conspiracy theories and the like.  So it is based on correct 
facts and it is based on reasonable observation and it is 
based on reasonable conclusions made by that reasonable 
observer from those facts. 
 
Chair, as far as the relationship between the applicant 
and the Chair is concerned.  Again, it is not entirely clear 
what the case has but practically speaking, any reliance on 
that grounds seems to have been disavowed notwithstanding 
the claim in paragraph 15.1 that you should not have 
accepted the position as chair. 
10 
 
It seems that the applicant has contrived his recordal to 
the 
historical, 
professional 
and 
personal 
relationship 
between yourself and the applicant.  There is no allegation 
to link those circumstances to bias.  Nowhere is it said 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have misunderstood Mr Sikhakhane.  
I got the impression that he was not relying on that but 
maybe he was.  Maybe you should address it in case 
...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, Chair I do not intend to go into 
20 
any detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Simply to point out that there is no 
allegation 
that 
links 
any 
relationship, 
professional 
or 
personal to any allegation of bias.   
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 112 of 160 
 
 
There is nothing that says because you know the former 
President.  Therefore, you will be bias for whatever reasons 
and the like.  It is just an allegation in the air. 
 
Ultimately, Chair the applicant relies on the record of 
proceedings of the Commission to date  Firstly, he complains 
about the selection of witnesses and says this shows bias. 
 
In oral submissions before you, the allegation seems to 
have changed somewhat into the order of witnesses because 
I think, having read the answering papers, it must be 
conceded that having called 257 witnesses, it could not 
10 
possible be said that all those witnesses have been called 
according to a predetermined plan or project Chair. 
 
But what is worth noting is that amongst those 257 
witnesses that have been called, is the son of the former 
president, Duduzane Zuma, Ms Dudu Myeni and others who 
clearly do not fall into the category of witnesses that has 
been put before you as being a category of witnesses, and 
we do not admit that for a second Chair. 
 
But as we will address you Chair.  The selection of the 
witnesses in the order because that appears to be the 
20 
complaint now that they record, is logically explicable by the 
mandate that you were given. 
 
You were told Chair to investigate the allegations called 
as relevant in the Public Protector’s report.  You were told to 
use the Public Protector’s report as your starting point and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 113 of 160 
 
you did that. 
 
Having heard those allegations, the scope of the inquiry 
then, inevitable, widened and very, very early on, in 2018, 
you approached the former president for a version in respect 
of the evidence that have begun to be led.  Without 
explanation, there has been no response to that. 
 
Chair, then the applicant relies on the exchanges 
between yourself and the witnesses during the course of 
hearings of the Commission and very selective passages are 
relied on we will deal with some of them. 
10 
 
The applicant’s accession reveals two aspects, however.  
First, we submit to you that there is a lack of appreciation of 
the duties of the Chair in an inquisitorial setting.   
 
It is your job Chair, not the job of the legal team, to 
interrogate witnesses, to put versions to them, to make sure 
you understand what their version is and to highlight what 
issues of concern you have, not only for that witness but for 
other people observing the proceedings who might or might 
not be implicated.  If you did not do so Chair, you would be 
failing in your duties as Chair of an inquisitorial proceeding.   
20 
 
Secondly, Chair, the selection of passages shows clearly 
a misreading or a misunderstanding of the very passages 
relied on and we will go there to show that.  Ultimately, there 
is nothing in the record that remotely approaches bias or a 
reasonable apprehension of bias. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 114 of 160 
 
 
Put differently Chair.  If the applicant hears the 
proceedings or reads the record and conclude that adverse 
findings might at some future date be date against him, that 
is no ground for recusal. 
 
And then there is no merit in the remaining grounds, 
some 
of 
which 
were 
advanced 
in 
argument, 
press 
statements, matters related to the medical admission and the 
like and we will deal with matters related to the medical 
condition 
and 
so-called 
press 
statements 
or 
press 
conferences which did not happen. 
10 
 
Then Chair, the applicant also appears to suggest that 
you, somehow, been dealt harshly or unfairly because this 
Commission is insistent on him appearing to testify. 
 
Again Chair, it is important for all to understand that this 
is not an adversarial process such as a criminal trial or a 
civil trial, where if a party remains silent, the other party 
wins or the party remains in silent might face a conviction if 
it is a criminal trial. 
 
This is different.  This is a commission of inquiry.  Here 
the Commission must deal comprehensively with its mandate 
20 
and its Terms Of Reference as an inquisitorial body.  In 
short.  Mr Zuma must be heard and his version must be 
considered.  Why this should constitute bias, we fail to 
understand Chair.   
 
If one looks at page 83 – paragraph 83, rather Chair, of 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 115 of 160 
 
the answering affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is different from – that page number 
is different from the paginated number. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 Yes, 
Chair 
the 
Commission 
paginated the papers.  So my learned friend, and although 
they got an electronic copy, we have, for convenience, both 
been referring to paragraphs, rather than pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But if I may follow that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We accept the fundamental basis of 
the application ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am trying to locate the 
answering affidavit.  Is that in the ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the red file? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, it will be in the red file at the 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After what – which divider? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   After the first divider, I would 
20 
imagine and it is a page red 78 Chair, if that helps.  But it is 
paragraph 83.  That is how I will refer to both. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to give me the paginated 
number, the red numbers? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 78 Chair. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 116 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   78.  Oh, I thought you said the answering 
affidavit.  78 is the applicant’s founding affidavit.  So I was 
looking for the wrong ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, I am talking about the 
answering affidavit Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you bear with me for a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry, if I may just refer you to the 
answering affidavit.  I gave you the incorrect reference.  My 
10 
apologies.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is important Chair about the 
necessity ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the right page or paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 665 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The red numbers? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Red numbers, 665. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, Mr Pretorius.  I think your team did 
not put in the answering affidavit here.  I have got 646 here, 
20 
647 and then the next is 697.  There is something missing.  I 
read it last night.  So. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  The simple thing 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you can ...[intervenes]  
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 117 of 160 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...what has been raised before and 
you are familiar with the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am familiar.  You can read it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is not sufficient for the applicant to 
say:  I have seen several Rule 3.3. notices.  I have elected 
not to respond to those notices.  Because, he says, he is not 
implicated by them.   
 
He does not have to answer, which is quite a different 
proposition to the proposition that we now hear about those 
witnesses, who quite apart from conspiring to harm the 
10 
former president, have given, what appears in essence, a set 
of false submissions or evidence.   
 
But be that - that contradiction is there for the record 
among others, they implicate the former president or they do 
not.  If they implicate him, as it appears to be the very basis 
of the recusal application, your comments on that evidence.   
 
Then 
they 
should 
have 
been 
dealt 
with 
through 
applications for cross-examination and to put the version.  At 
least, that opportunity was open to the former president.  He 
could have done so.  He elected not to do so. 
20 
 
But where the former president does not have an 
election in relation to evidence is when he is summonsed to 
do so, either in terms of Regulation 10.6 or in response to a 
summons.   
 
There is no question of an election and your reason for

calling the former president is manifest and it is necessitated 
by your mandate Chair.  You have to hear his version.  It is 
necessary for you to properly complete your work.   
 
There is no bias in that approach Chair.  You are 
obliged, with respect, to do everything within your power, 
lawfully within your power to compel the presence of the – 
the appearance of the former president and to hear his 
evidence. 
 
Chair, if I may turn now to the written submissions and 
go immediately to the legal principles which I have averted 
10 
to in the introduction and my learned friend has relied upon 
the South African Rugby Football Union case which is a 
binding and clearly set of principles. 
 
The test is highlighted in paragraph 14.   
“The question is whether a reasonable, objective 
and informed person would on the correct facts... 
 
I am sorry Chair.  Do you have it?  Paragraph 14? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
“The question is whether a reasonable, objective 
20 
and informed person would on the correct facts, 
apprehend that the judge has or will not bring an 
impartial mind to bear on the adjudication of the 
case.  That is a mind open to persuasion by the 
evidence and the submissions of counsel.” 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 119 of 160 
 
 
Whatever you say and whatever prima facie views you 
may held, not the test.  The test is whether, at the end of the 
day, you are still capable of being persuaded and you have 
an open mind in that regard. 
 
That test is established against the background of the 
presumption.  We deal with that in paragraph 15, the Irvin 
and Johnson case, SACCAWU and Irvin and Johnson.   
 
Again, my learned friend relied upon that, the decision 
of the Constitutional Court.  The first point is that: 
“In considering an application for recusal, the court 
10 
as a starting point presumes that judicial officers 
are impartial in adjudicating complaints.” 
 
It that presumption that must now be displaced.  Firstly 
by allegations and secondly by a convincing argument that 
you Chair will not retain an open mind.  We do not think that 
that submission has been made at all. 
 
The second is that” 
“Impartiality does not entail absolute neutrality.  
That is rather the quality of open-minded readiness 
to persuasion.” 
20 
 
So if no case has been made out or you remain 
unconvinced Chair that you cannot be persuaded, you do not 
have a discretion.  You may not recuse yourself particularly 
in these circumstances. 
 
There is a double requirement of reasonableness.   
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 120 of 160 
 
“Not only must the person apprehending bias be a 
reasonable person but the apprehension itself must 
be in the circumstances reasonable.” 
 
In other words, its objective on two grounds.  Firstly, 
objectively speaking, there must be an apprehension of bias, 
not subjectively speaking.  Not based on – and we will show 
ironically subjective bias – but based on objective correct 
facts. 
 
And secondly, that apprehension must also pass the test 
of reasonableness.  We deal in the next section Chair with 
10 
the presumption of impartiality.   
 
And in paragraph 19.2 of the heads we say that that 
presumption is not easily dislodged.  What the case has said 
is that it requires cogent and convincing evidence for that 
presumption to be rebutted.   
 
Then we make the point in paragraph 21 Chair that 
impartiality does not entail absolute neutrality.  Impartiality 
does not require absolute neutrality but rather an open-
mined readiness to persuasion. 
 
So Chair, a judge can have views.  A judge can express 
20 
those views.  That is not the rest.  As long as that judge is 
capable of being persuaded to a contrary view or to his own 
view, that passes the test and defeats any reliance on bias 
or presumed bias. 
 
So the Constitutional Court in SACCAWU emphasised: 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 121 of 160 
 
“Callous neutrality stands in contrast to judicial 
impartiality.  Impartiality is that quality of open-
mined 
readiness 
to 
persuasion. 
 
Impartiality 
requires, in short, a mind open to persuasion by the 
evidence and submissions of counsel.” 
 
And what the extracts of the record show Chair is 
precisely that.  You raise a concern, you raise your 
interpretation on the evidence.  You might even say:  I might 
rely on this evidence or I might rely on the view.  What do 
you say? 
10 
 
And this is where you role Chair as an inquisitor comes 
in.  It is your obligation not to remain silent.  You are not an 
empire who says out or not out.  That is not your job. 
 
Your job Chair is to raise.  You are the investigator, not 
the legal team.  The legal team is there to assist you.  It is 
your job, if I may say without presumption Chair but this is 
for the purposes of the argument, not a lecture.   
 
You may say Chair that I should remain silent.  I must 
hear the opposing parties and there are no opposing parties 
in this matter and I must be – I must decide who is right and 
20 
who is wrong.   
 
That is not what an inquiry is about.  It is your job 
Chair, with respect, to investigate.  To ask questions, to 
interrogate, to test versions, to put contrary versions to 
raise your concerns and you have done no more than that. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 122 of 160 
 
 
Chair, then in the next section we deal with the 
double requirement of reasonableness and we talk about 
the test for recusal being objective in two respects.  It is 
the reasonable observer making a reasonable conclusion 
on all the correct facts. 
 
So mere apprehensiveness on the part of a litigant 
that a judge will be biased, even a strongly and honestly 
felt anxiety is not enough and what you have before you, 
Chair, and we will show that by reference to the papers is 
a hugely subjective assessment of what has occurred in 
10 
the submission. 
 
So what the law does, it imposes on the fears and 
apprehensions of an individual litigant in an adversarial 
context 
or 
any 
witness 
in 
this 
context, 
it 
imposes 
enormative 
assessment. 
 
It 
says 
your 
fear 
– 
your 
apprehension 
must 
be 
tested 
against 
two 
objective 
requirements of reasonableness based on the facts.  It 
must be a reasonable person, not you, and it must be a 
reasonable assessment. 
 
Chair, then we go to the application of this test in 
20 
the context of the Commission and we make the point in 
paragraph 29, to which I have alluded, that the Commission 
is a judicial commission, it should not be confused with 
adversarial court proceedings.  This is not a court of law,  
that is stating the obvious, Chair.  It is important to 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 123 of 160 
 
understand –again perhaps so that this argument and what 
your duties are can be understood in the public eye, Chair, 
here there is no dispute brought before you by a party in 
an adverse relationship with another party.  There is no 
case presented to you which one party seeks to prove and 
the other party seeks to contradict. 
 
So your job, Chair, in that situation might be to sit 
back and listen to the parties to weigh up the evidence led 
and the case put before you by either party and to 
determine who is right or wrong, not the situation here at 
10 
all.  Your situation, Chair, is as the main inquisitor and, in 
fact, the only inquisitor, to dig deep into the versions of the 
parties and to make sure that the public out there know 
what the concerns are that need to be addressed in this 
Commission. 
 
So, Chair, when a party remains silent in a civil trial 
the other side might win.  When a party remains silent in a 
criminal trial, a conviction might follow.  You have been 
invited by the former President, Chair, to make whatever 
findings you determine in the face of failure to answer the 
20 
versions put implicating the former President. 
 
But that invitation is not good enough.  The version 
must be put before you before you can say I have done my 
job comprehensively.  It would be entirely second prize for 
you to accept evidence in the absence of counter evidence 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 124 of 160 
 
from the very person who claims that he is at the centre of 
the allegations. 
 
So, Chair, your job would then be in the inquisitorial 
process to uncover the truth, having heard all the versions 
so the public can be satisfied that the recommendations 
you make to the President, which are not binding, by the 
way, but the recommendations ultimately that you make to 
the President can restore some public confidence in the 
institutions and processes of government as a whole. 
 
So, 
chair, 
according 
to 
the 
authorities, 
the 
10 
Commissioner - and I am referring to the Corruption Watch 
Arms Procurement case where the court laid down quite 
extensively the duties of a Commission of Inquiry.  The 
Commission has duty to squarely test the veracity of the 
evidence before it rather than asking only peripheral 
questions.  You cannot remain silent as enjoined in 
argument, Chair.  It must, subject the account of implicated 
persons, to rigorous scrutiny in an attempt to arrive at an 
accurate set of findings.  There is not one but there are 
hundreds 
of 
examples 
of 
that 
happening 
in 
this 
20 
Commission. 
 
The same applies to witnesses who accuse others, 
their version must be tested.  If, Chair, you are concerned 
that a witness before you has given clear and convincing 
evidence, there is nothing wrong, in fact it is probably your 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 125 of 160 
 
duty to say so as a matter of concern for others who might 
be implicated by those witnesses, so they are alerted to 
the fact that they need to come and give contradictory 
evidence. 
 
So, Chair, when the Chairperson places on record 
his understanding of the import of the evidence, both for 
the witness and for implicated or concerned parties, he is 
acting entirely appropriately, particularly in an inquisitorial 
context. 
And it may well go further, Chair, you may have an 
10 
obligation to do so which, if you fail, may lead to questions 
being asked about the propriety of the Commission’s 
proceedings. 
So, Chair, although the test for recusal remains the 
same, whether this is an adversarial trial or a Commission 
of Inquiry, the application of the test must, according to the 
authorities, take place or take account of the specific 
institutional setting of a Chairperson in a Commission 
which is different from that of a judge in court. 
Chair, I am not going to deal with the allegations in 
20 
relation to the relationship between the parties, I accept 
what my learned friend says about the purpose for which 
those allegations are made in the founding affidavit. 
But, Chair, from paragraphs 36 to paragraph 47 the 
issues are dealt with in detail and of course it bears 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 126 of 160 
 
mention that all the circumstances relating to the personal 
relationship were in place long before you were appointed 
to your current position as Deputy Chief Justice or even 
before you were appointed to the bench, Chair. 
Then, Chair, the nub of the complaint giving rise to 
the claim for your recusal is dealt with in paragraph 48 and 
following.  The applicant says first the selection of the 
Commission’s witnesses exhibits bias and I must correct 
that because from my learned friend says, gives rise to an 
apprehension of bias and it is not just the selection or not 
10 
the selection per se but the order in which the witnesses 
were called. 
Secondly, the Commission has allegedly ignored 
Mur Zuma’s testimony. 
Thirdly, 
the 
Chairperson 
has 
made 
prejudicial 
comments against Mr Zuma. 
Fourthly, Mr Zuma was treated unfairly during his 
appearance before the Commissioner. 
Fifthly, the Chairperson doubted Mr Zuma’s bona 
fide as regarding his ill health, and  
20 
Sixthly, 
the 
Chairperson’s 
press 
statements 
concerning the applicant are justified and exhibit bias.  
That is a very rough and broad summary but included in 
paragraph 48.3 are the comments raised in the founding 
affidavit and our submission is that these grounds for 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 127 of 160 
 
recusal 
are 
simply 
without 
merit. 
 
Even 
if 
taking 
cumulatively no reasonable person would apprehend bias 
when observing the conduct and record of the Commission. 
We deal in paragraph 50, Chair, under the next 
heading with the issue of selection of witnesses.  The 
allegation is apparently that the Commission has exhibited 
bias in – or raised an apprehension of bias in its selection 
of witnesses and that was qualified this morning to the 
extent that the allegations appears to be that the order in 
which these witnesses were called raises an apprehension 
10 
of bias and of course that concession of necessity had to 
be made.  It was pointed out in the answering affidavit that 
257, not 9, witnesses have been called and amongst those 
witnesses are those who could hardly have been said to 
have held the type of view that the applicant and his legal 
representatives pin on the witnesses who have give 
evidence in the category complained of. 
Chair, the first answer to that proposition is that 
you have done no more than execute your mandate.  You 
were given the report of the Public Protector, you were told 
20 
to investigate the allegations of the witnesses who gave 
evidence before the Public Protector, to use the report as 
your starting point and you did not more than hear the 
witnesses who - hear many of the witnesses who fell into 
that category and then began to explore the evidence 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 128 of 160 
 
arising. 
Secondly, Chair, you are dealing with allegations of 
state capture, corruption and fraud  It is necessary for you, 
with respect, Chair, as an inquisitor, to understand those 
allegations, you must hear what those allegations about, 
you 
cannot 
make 
any 
presumptions 
as 
what 
those 
allegations are about, you cannot rely on external sources, 
press reports, what people may say out there, you need to 
hear first hand and you have done that, Chair. 
The logic behind the Commission’s work is also 
10 
clear. 
 
Witnesses 
who 
give 
evidence 
before 
the 
Commission 
were 
initially 
at 
least 
identified 
by 
the 
investigators in consultation with the legal team and finally 
determined by yourself.  You give directions as to who 
should be called to testify and witnesses who come before 
the Commission are those that are called upon to testify 
after investigation and those voluntarily come forward to 
testify.  Ironically, the former President has not offered 
himself to give evidence at any stage let alone at the 
beginning stages of the inquiry. 
20 
In paragraph 53 we point out that amongst the 257 
witnesses, 
excluding 
Mr 
Zuma, 
that 
have 
presented 
evidence before the Commission including Mr Duduzane 
Zuma.  There is no complaint that he was unfairly treated, 
at least that we know of.  Ms Dudu Myeni, Ms Nomvulo 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 129 of 160 
 
Mokanyane, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, Mr Des van Rooyen, Mr 
Richard Baloyi.  That is a preliminary list.  There are many 
others 
who 
cannot 
at 
all 
be 
accused 
on 
whatever 
conspiratorial 
basis 
of 
belonging 
to 
a 
category 
of 
witnesses designed to further the aims of a political 
project. 
Secondly, Chair, what appears to have been ignored 
are 
the 
repeated 
calls 
made 
by 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Commission to the public for people to come forward and 
give evidence.  You have not said those that believe in this 
10 
political project and conspiracy please come forward, you 
have made it quite clear that anybody who has any 
information from the highest office to the most humble 
office should come forward to assist.  You have said that 
not once but many, many times and you have expressed on 
occasion your disappointment that there has appeared to 
be a reluctance on the part of some to come forward. 
Chair, in the following paragraphs at page 15 and 
following, we deal with the specific context which must be 
notified in accordance with the authorities or must be 
20 
noted in accordance with the authorities that the person 
against whom bias is alleged must be judged in the context 
within which that person acts.  In other words, in this case, 
in inquisitorial proceedings and the authorities we quote at 
paragraph 
56 
and 
following. 
 
In 
short, 
Chair, 
as 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 130 of 160 
 
Chairperson you are obliged to be more inquiring than a 
judge would be in an adversarial setting. 
 
So, Chair, in paragraph 58 we refer to The Standard 
Bank case, a judgment of the Supreme Court of Appeal 
which says that a supine approach - in other words, the 
silent umpire approach towards litigation by judicial officer 
is not justifiable either in terms of the fair trial requirement 
or in the context of resources. 
 
Chair, in paragraph 58, the Bernert and Absa Bank 
case, the following was said by the Constitutional Court: 
10 
Judicial officers will put questions to counsel or 
their 
legal 
representatives 
based 
on 
those 
impressions.” 
In other words, impressions that you may form or you may 
have been requested to form. 
“...and thereby provide litigants with the opportunity 
to rebut any correct impression formed.  This does 
not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.” 
Simply put, Chair, if you gain an impression or you are 
asked to accept an impression and you express that, that 
20 
does not mean that there is or can be a reasonable 
apprehension of bias. 
 
So it is not bias for a judge to say what he has been 
asked to think.  It is not bias for a judge to say what in the 
course of a trial he is thinking.  It is only bias when he 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 131 of 160 
 
shows he can never change his mind and he is open to 
persuasion.  But, Chair, the very reason you raise those 
issues is to invite persuasion and contrary views and that 
is clear from the record.  That really is the crux of the 
case, Chair, because that bar has not – or that hurdle had 
not been passed. 
 
So, Chair, we expand on that notion of a judge 
inquisitorial legal systems or in an inquiry of this nature.  
In an inquisitorial legal system – and this is an inquisitorial 
process, Chair, the judge takes the lead.  Counsel, legal 
10 
representatives are there to assist and ask questions later 
not in the beginning. 
 
So, Chair, it is perhaps surprising that the applicant 
can rely on the passages that have been relied upon in the 
founding affidavit to show bias rather than a truth seeking 
exercise 
and 
at 
sometimes 
a 
forceful 
truth 
seeking 
exercise where you raised issues and you insisted on 
answers. 
 
So the active questioning of witnesses, the testing 
of propositions, the provisional acceptance of propositions 
20 
is part of your duties, with respect. 
 
Chair, we have searched in vain for any display of 
hostility as alleged towards Mr Zuma in any public 
comment that you might have made.  There is not unkind 
public comment that you have made and in any event it 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 132 of 160 
 
would have to be shown that those comments, whatever 
they were, rendered you incapable of maintaining an 
impartial mind and that is not part of the allegations that 
you have to deal with. 
 
So, Chair, it is difficult not to conclude that the real 
reason the applicant is before you in this application is 
that he has an apprehension that there might be findings 
against him.  That is dealt with in the SARFU case, Chair, 
and paragraph 71 of our heads where it said: 
“It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the 
10 
ground 
for 
disqualification 
is 
a 
reasonable 
apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide 
the case impartially or without prejudice rather than 
that he will decide the case adversely to one party.” 
There is a fear that things are not going too well but the 
evidence is mounting, but that evidence seems to be 
convincing, even if you say that, Chair, that is not enough.  
It is the absence of an impartial or prejudiced absent 
approach to all that evidence. 
 
So the test for recusal, according to Bernert in the 
20 
Constitutional Court does not permit a disgruntled litigant 
to successfully complain of bias simply because the 
judicial officer has ruled against him or her, it is still less, 
said something in relation to evidence that might not sit 
well with the particular complainant concerned. 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 133 of 160 
 
 
Chair, you have made no findings in relation to what 
some may call a political project nor have you expressed 
any view in that regard.  You have made no finding in 
relation to a conspiracy.  We can assure the applicant, 
although I do not want it to go too far into what the 
investigators do, because the regulations preclude that, 
that following in the evidence of the former President at 
the last hearing in July of last year extensive steps were 
taken by the investigators to take statements in regard to 
the evidence given by the former President on the first day.  
10 
Not only that, there has been response from certain 
witnesses implicated by that evidence who have come 
forward and give evidence.  That is a matter in process.  I 
do not want to go into too much detail but, Chair, the 
matter has been dealt with and is being dealt with, as we 
must, Chair. 
 
Secondly, Chair, the applicant has not been singled 
out by the Commission for any special treatment.  If 
anything, he may complain that he has been given 
favourable treatment and treated gently.  There is no doubt 
20 
that, as my learned friend concedes, that the performer 
President is central to the work of the this Commission and 
any potential findings and that is why, Chair, you want to 
hear his evidence and that is why you have called for that 
evidence whether in written or verbal form throughout, 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 134 of 160 
 
persistently and from the latter part of 2018.. 
 
We sent out in paragraph 76.1 the reasons why Mr 
Zuma’s evidence is so important to this Commission, we do 
not need to repeat them, they have been stated many 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to say something, Mr Pretorius, 
but, as I say, it is more for Mr Sikhakhane to hear so that 
when he comes back, when he replies, he has thought 
about if he needs to think about it and he can deal with it.   
 
Well, Mr Sikhakhane has said that the case is not 
10 
that of bias, as such, it is apprehension of bias but of 
course I think some correspondence – and I do not know 
whether 
the 
affidavit 
as 
well, 
but 
it 
is 
some 
correspondence suggested, as I read it, that it is bias and I 
was 
concerned 
– 
and 
of 
course 
there 
was 
some 
correspondence, 
I 
think 
that 
he 
was 
talking 
about 
predetermined outcome and things like that and I was 
thinking, you know, if you are – if I am biased against a 
particular witness and that witness has been given 3.3 
notices and has elected not to challenge the evidence of 
20 
witnesses who implicate or may be said to implicate him, if 
I am biased against that witness, seems to me the easiest 
way would be not to insist that that witness should come 
but to say okay, just take all the evidence against that 
witness because of course my findings when he has not 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 135 of 160 
 
brought his evidence to put his side of the story, that is 
going to based on that.  But when you want to hear all 
sides, one wants to weigh everything so that you do not 
make findings based on just one side of witnesses, I would 
have thought that it would be seen as somebody who really 
wants to hear all sides before making a finding rather than 
say well, you got a change to challenge this evidence, you 
have elected not to challenge, so it is fine, we will go 
ahead with the witnesses who have given evidence.  So but 
based on Mr Sikhakhane’s submissions, I think that may 
10 
have fallen away, but he might  be able to say something. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  In fact, Chair, if you 
were a judge in a trial you could adopt that attitude, you 
could say if in this civil trial the defendant does not want to 
give evidence as an umpire of the contest that I see 
playing out before me, I am entitled to decide, you would 
not in ordinary circumstances be entitled to force a party to 
give 
a 
version 
before 
you, 
I 
stress 
in 
ordinary 
circumstances. But the approach that you have adopted is 
not because, with great respect, Chair, you are nice person 
20 
or you are a fair person, it is because you have to.  In an 
inquisitorial situation you have to cajole, compel, do 
whatever you have to, to conclude your mandate because, 
quite frankly, without all the evidence, the findings that you 
will make ultimately must be appropriately qualified and if 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 136 of 160 
 
someone is keen to see this Commission work, that person 
should be knocking at your door persistently to say I have 
a version, I have facts, I want to put them completely 
before you and I want to deal with all the evidence of this 
conspiracy against me.   
And with respect to the former President, the 
impression being placed before you is that he does seek to 
cooperate.  Well, that is not the history of the facts before 
you, Chair, and those have been set in the summons 
application as summarised in paragraph 77 where we are 
10 
now.  You asked right at the beginning of the proceedings 
of the Commission in relation to the very first witnesses, 
Mr Zuma, please give me your written response to the 
evidence of Ms Mentor and Mr Maseko, you have not got 
that response.  You have asked again, please can I have 
that response?  You have not been favoured with a 
response or an explanation for the failure to give the 
response. 
In July of 2019 an undertaking was made that you 
would 
receive 
a 
response 
to 
the 
areas 
of 
interest 
20 
document.  You were told today that well, there were Covid 
difficulties 
and 
there 
were 
difficulties 
in 
relation 
to 
attorneys 
being 
changed. 
 
I 
am 
afraid, 
Chair, 
that 
explanation has never been proffered before you except 
today when the former President is facing summons and it 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 137 of 160 
 
is not good enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course Covid 19 happened this year 
and the affidavits should have been filed or delivered 
sometime last year. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Some last year, shortly after 
August of 2019, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is no reason why that 
document – not acceptable reason why that document 
could not have been presented.  It does indicate that there 
10 
is a reluctance to participate in the Commission other than 
by way of election not to respond in terms of Section 3.4 
and the like.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see, and again this is 
something …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Regulation 3.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mention more for Mr Sikhakhane than 
for you, one gets concerned if there is undertaking made to 
say we will file affidavits by whatever agreed date and then 
not only are the affidavits not filed but no attempt is made 
20 
to show courtesy of an explanation to say we have some 
difficulties, 
these 
are 
our 
difficulties, 
can 
you 
accommodate us, or ask for an extension of time, one gets 
more concerned when one deals with that situation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair, in paragraph 77 we go 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 138 of 160 
 
on to say that Regulation 10[6] directives have been 
issued, not once, but twice at least, repeatedly issued, no 
response, no explanation or any failure to respond, and the 
answer to that conduct Chair may lie in the propositions 
put to you this morning, that in fact the former President is 
of the belief that this State Capture Commission is a 
political project, designed to somehow defeat or prejudiced 
in a significant way the former President.   
That would explain the conduct to date and that  
cannot 
rest 
comfortably 
with 
the 
notion 
that 
full 
10 
cooperation has been offered which it has not and is being 
offered and one would hope that perhaps after today full 
cooperation will be offered and that is not with respect to 
her being Ms Dudu Myeni approach Chair this Commission 
needs a full explanation of that approach that says that 
this is a political conspiracy designed to defeat the former 
President.   
Chair I want to refer to, to two things which indicate  
that far from being objective the approach adopted by the 
former President is itself based on conjecture and bias.  If 
20 
one looks at the founding affidavit paragraph 41, I do not 
have the red numbers Chair immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say paragraph 41 of the 
founding affidavit?       
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair.  
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 139 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will find it, yes I have got it.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   For the record we at page 30.  
There Chair the statement is made as follows: 
“It is clear that the Chairperson took a view that I 
must simply answer the narrative that I dismissed 
Mr 
Nene 
for 
nefarious 
and 
corrupt 
objectives 
related to the so called nuclear project.  Nene is 
portrayed as one who stood guard against my 
alleged 
unrealistic 
and 
corrupt 
ambitions 
who 
caused 
the 
irresponsible 
spending 
of 
public 
10 
finances in pursuance of a nuclear deal.” 
Chair that complaint that the former President was called 
upon to answer on what he regarded as a ridiculous 
assertion just fails to understand the job that you have to 
perform.  You have a proposition before you which gives an 
explanation as to why a particular Minister was dismissed.  
You call upon the President to answer that, the  
President says that is ridiculous why call upon me to 
answer that.  The proposition just needs to be stated for it 
to be understood as fallacious it is your duty once again 
20 
Chair whatever you might think or whatever anybody else 
might think about that allegation to call for an answer and 
it is the duty of someone who seeks to cooperate in the 
affairs of the Commission to answer.   
I am sure Chair it is perhaps ironic that an 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 140 of 160 
 
important 
witness 
that 
is 
Mr 
Zuma 
himself 
who 
is 
potentially able to contradict, confirm, clarify evidence 
referred to by him in his founding affidavit has been 
repeatedly invited and now summons to give evidence but 
there appears to be and I hope it is only an apparent 
conclusion that might be drawn a reluctance to come and 
do that, Chair.   
Chair I would like to deal with the question you 
raised earlier with my learned friend about the nature of 
the relief sought.  We deal with that in paragraph 88. Then 
10 
the notice of motion prayer one the prayer is the following: 
“Recusing 
the 
Chairperson 
from 
chairing 
the 
Commission of enquiry proceedings relating to the 
applicant’s testimony and directing that that lawful 
steps be taken to find a replacement Chairperson to 
hear the testimony of the applicant.” 
Now that is unclear Chair.  The second part is clear: 
“That 
what 
is 
required 
is 
that 
a 
replacement 
Chairperson come and sit here this week and hear 
the evidence of the applicant.” 
20 
What is to happen to the contradictory evidence given by 
33 or 34 witness we must judge that evidence.  Who’s 
going to make findings about credibility?  What if the new 
Chair believes that this was a political conspiracy and this 
whole Commission is a political conspiracy and you find 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 141 of 160 
 
the opposite.  The situation on the narrow interpretation 
that you must recuse yourself for this week to hear this 
evidence it is unworkable.  But if one goes on to the 
affidavit in paragraph 3 of the founding affidavit the 
applicant says: 
“The Chairperson is required to recuse himself from 
presiding so that those issues that pertain to Mr 
Zuma and his family.” 
He says myself and my family in the affidavit it is 
incorrectly recorded there in paragraph 88.3 I apologise 
10 
Chair.  But in the essence he is saying that you must 
recuse yourself from presiding over all those issues that 
pertain to Mr Zuma and his family that would include Mr 
Duduzani Zuma whose evidence you have already heard 
and would include anything related to your several terms of 
reference in relation to which Mr Zuma is expressly 
mentioned as being implicated by the terms of reference 
and all the evidence that has been given.  
Who’s going to draw that line between you and your  
replacement colleague as to what you can do and what 
20 
someone else can do.  In fact, the authorities are quite 
clear Chair that once you are recused you cannot make 
findings and it would mean that you cannot make findings 
central to the Commission.  It would render your future 
participation in this Commission entirely nugatory and 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 142 of 160 
 
would mean in fact the collapse of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can one ever in a Commission such as 
this recuse oneself from hearing the witness the evidence 
of a specific witness or certain specific witnesses but 
hearing, but hear the rest of the witnesses?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair I suppose to think about that 
for a moment there may be a situation where there is an 
issue so separate and discreet from the main issues that 
the Commission has to deal with that it could be decided 
for example by a medical expert or by an accountant or by 
10 
an engineer and then you would rely on that finding but 
ultimately the responsibility for the findings remains yours 
but not in this case Chair quite clearly.    
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess in that situation if it comes back 
to you, you still have to see somebody else making a 
finding and you are bound by it.  It is different maybe if 
they make a recommendation and you can then make a 
finding in regard to such a matter.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry Chair I was distracted 
for a moment would you mind repeating. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am saying it is difficult to see a 
situation where somebody else you made an example of 
some medical expert making a finding and then you are 
bound by it as Chairperson.  It is different if they make a 
recommendation which you can examine and if you are 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 143 of 160 
 
persuaded it is right then you accept but there are all kinds 
of difficulties that might need to be looked at because in 
the end the findings in the context of this Commission must 
be the findings of the Judge selected by the Chief Justice.   
If it is findings is made by somebody else that might 
be problematic because the remedial action said these 
issues must be investigated and decided upon by a Judge 
selected by the Chief Justice and not by the President.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair the furthest one would go in 
the context of this Commission is that it would perhaps be 
10 
permissible for you to rely on the opinion of an expert 
where you feel that you do not have the ability to make the 
necessary judgement but the decision is to whether to rely 
on it or not would remain yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It does not appear to me that there 
is any wrong here for a second Chair to deal with all 
matters relating to Mr Zuma and his family.  Drawing a line 
between those issues and the remaining issues of the 
Commission would be impossible. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In fact the central issue in this 
Commission according to the terms of reference is the 
issue relating or are the issues relating to Mr Zuma and 
perhaps his family as well.   
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 144 of 160 
 
And then Chair between you and your replacement 
who would decide what issues relate to Mr Zuma and his 
family and what if there is a disagreement who wins as it 
were it is just simply unworkable one just needs to think 
through the implications of that proposition to understand 
that it really is unfortunately and I hesitate to say this 
because it is an extreme conclusion in many contexts.  
It is an all or nothing position where there can be 
no compromise.  Chair if I may deal with – I see I do have 
a little time left. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   With some of the extracts that 
were relied upon in the founding affidavit.  Chair if I can 
take you to the numbering is somewhat problematic at one 
stage where paragraphs numbers are repeated but if I 
could take you to paragraph 53.2 on page 32. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you talking about the founding 
affidavit on 32 so what document are you talking about?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The founding affidavit Chair page 
32 of the founding affidavit.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 32 I have got paragraphs 46, 47 
and 48 and you said paragraph fifty something.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair, I am not referring to the 
red numbers I am referring to the page numbers it is at 
page 26.    
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 145 of 160 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us stick to the red numbers.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got that were you referring 
to paragraph 32?  Were you referring to paragraph 32? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No paragraph 53.2.  
CHAIRPERSON:   53? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair again the numbering is 
confusing because it was a repeat.  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no paragraph 53 at page 26 and 
you said it is the red numbers.  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 26 red 26 only has paragraph 
…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I hesitate to say I have been 
misled it is my responsibility.  It is red number page 37.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got it.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, paragraph 53.2.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair below the extract is 
dealing with an exchange between yourself and Ms Hogan 
20 
and in the second paragraph when dealing with her 
evidence about the former President you say and you put: 
“Is there room you can just answer this question to 
the best of your ability.  Do you think there may be 
room 
for 
any 
suggestion 
that 
maybe 
your 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 146 of 160 
 
personality and his personality, your respective 
ways of dealing with issues were such that the 
kinds of differences that came up maybe were lucky 
to come up or is that something that you had not 
thought about.” 
So in other words an issue is raised in your mind that 
maybe this is all down to a difference of an opinion that it 
does not bear the import that the witness Ms Hogan 
intends and you raise it as a concern that does not mean 
to say you believe that or that you trying to persuade the 
10 
witness to say that on the contrary you were merely raising 
it.   
And then the passage relied over the page relied 
upon by my learned friend the whole passage should be 
read because after the underlined portion there is another 
portion which says: 
“But having said that I think that I must say that 
that should not necessarily mean that he the former 
President did not have a mind that the Board could 
do whatever it considered it had a right to do.  In 
20 
other words, if it decided that it would dismiss him – 
that is Mr Moroga, it may well be that he was not 
excluding that that what he said to you just seem to 
say look Mr Moroga will continue as CEO and then 
the Board must decide whether they accept that or 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 147 of 160 
 
they decide to do whatever they decide.” 
A version that comes to your mind that you are exploring.  
You say well maybe the former President did not intend 
what 
you 
told 
me 
he 
intended 
maybe 
he 
intended 
nevertheless to defer to the Board, you put that version.  
In the very same paragraph of which, of the applicant 
complained.  Then paragraph, the second the penultimate 
paragraph on that page also relied upon:   
“Did you get an impression that there might have 
been private meetings between the President and 
10 
Mr Moroga?”   
Again an issue that strikes you as an issue of concern you 
asked the question.  You do not find that there are, that 
there is evidence of private meetings you ask the question.  
Now the question is Chair not whether you asked that or 
what a person might think you were getting at because he 
believes that this Commission is part of a conspiracy and 
Ms Hogan is a proponent of that conspiracy.  The test is at 
the end of the day will you be able to assess this evidence 
impartially 
with 
all 
the 
propositions 
for 
and 
all 
the 
20 
propositions against that you have put.   
Complaints is made Chair about what you say to 
witnesses including Ms Hogan an Mr Gordhan thanking 
them for coming to give evidence and alike.  Chair your 
approach consistently throughout this Commission from 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 148 of 160 
 
beginning to an end is to thank witnesses for coming 
forward for giving their versions and in the same breath to 
encourage other witnesses to come forward that that 
somehow is an expression of biased is simply untenable 
reasonable apprehension of biased.   
Then it is also complained that at paragraph 53.6 in 
dealing with Minister Gordhan you say at the bottom of 
page 36: 
“Okay that paragraph appears to me and you must 
tell me if you understand it different appears to be 
10 
an acknowledgment by the ruling party that the 
leadership structures that it had up to that stage 
were failing to arrest corruption and that these 
other practices that are mentioned there is that your 
understanding of the paragraph as well.” 
In other words, the statement of the witness’s implications 
you point out those implications and you ask the witness 
for those implications.  In no manner can it be said that 
that is your view in relation to the ruling party not the 
former President the ruling party that can never be 
20 
changed.  That is not alleged and it is not proved.  All that 
is said is that the applicant reads that and he is worried by 
that statement that is not the test Chair.  Then Chair the 
bottom of page 37 that same paragraph you say to Mr 
Gordhan: 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 149 of 160 
 
“I take it that the former President did not articulate 
his views in regard to the suggestion you made 
about what process you were thinking should be 
followed.”  
In other words, what the President did not say is indicative 
of a conclusion that might be drawn that he did not confirm 
that what you said about him is correct. It goes the other 
way or it could go the other way it does not matter Chair 
you were exploring.  Over the page: 
“President Zuma I think it is President Zuma that he 
10 
may want to put his preferred candidate through the 
usual process.  What I am saying is that I take it 
that he did not articulate to you any views about 
your suggestion at that time.” 
We know that later on he did not follow that process or you 
cannot and then there was an intervention and Mr Gordhan 
then admits not in an explicit way.  In other words, he has 
no confirmation there that President Zuma wanted to follow 
course A or course B.  Then at the bottom of the page you 
ask a question: 
20 
“Would the involvement of the Presidency in the 
appointment 
or 
re-appointment 
of 
members 
of 
Boards of SEO’s had been a normal thing, is that a 
normal thing or not?” 
A witness gives evidence to that and then you enquire as 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 150 of 160 
 
to its import.  I do not see that that shows that you can 
never bring an objective mind to bear on that evidence and 
then over the page again with Mr Gordhan you say to Mr 
Gordhan: 
“Am I missing anything that one could really say did 
happen that could be said to reflect a breakdown in 
the relationship between the two of you other than 
maybe just differences of opinion on certain issues 
relating to work?” 
You have raised that issue before in evidence Chair where 
10 
you say look is this not explicable or explainable by 
differences of opinion that you just did not get on that you 
could not work together and that explains the conflicts that 
you have spoken about in your evidence.  Again not a 
decision that is so but merely exploring whether it is so.   
Chair if I may one could go on Chair but I think that 
the pattern is clear that there is no evidence here in any of 
these extracts that you come close to saying I have made 
up my mind and I am not going to change my mind.  All you 
exhibit exactly the opposite if I may say with respect.     
20 
The propositions you put are generally qualified so 
on page 41 you say: 
“My other question is this if at the end of this 
process I come to the conclusion that definitely 
there was in State Capture there are certain 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 151 of 160 
 
consequences that follow and certain questions you 
must ask as a result of that.” 
There is no finding that State Capture is a reality in your 
mind Chair and so one can go on but I would like to just 
take one step further the proposition that in fact the 
propositions that have been put to you in the papers on 
behalf of the applicant and in argument by the applicant 
themselves rest on a preconceived notion and set of ideas 
and are coloured by that approach.  
So it is based in the fact this Commission is a 
10 
political conspiracy designed to undermine the former 
President as part of a factional struggle that informed the 
views then that interpret the passages that have been put 
before you and I may just take you to one glaring example. 
Page 46, well let us start at page 45 paragraph 53.9 
I am referring to the pages at the bottom again Chair.  If 
you want the other page for the record I can give it you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is better if we are consistent and use 
the red ones, the red page numbers of course you can say 
mention both, I think you said Mr Zuma’s legal team might 
20 
not have the red pagination.      
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes I will mention both it is red 
number 50 paginated or typed number 45 that is the 
answering affidavit numbers paragraph 53.9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 152 of 160 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now if there is any preconceived 
ideas it is expressed in this paragraph and it is a 
preconceived notion about your role Chair and your vision 
of matters. 53.9 the deponent to this affidavit says: 
“On 12 August 2020 the Chairperson made an 
attempt at seeming impatient with Gordhan.” 
In other words, the accusation is when you were visibly 
upset with Mr Gordhan on the 12 t h of August that you said 
so in no uncertain terms it is then interpreted as you 
producing a sham.   
10 
In other words, lying to the Commission and to the 
public that you were only pretending because you were so 
fond of Mr Gordhan and his political position that you were 
not impatient or upset with his attitude of not coming to the 
Commission which we dealt with at length but you made an 
attempt at seeming impatient.   
Now that is preposterous Chair quite frankly to 
accuse you of that indicates and apart from saying so what 
it does indicate coldly looked at is that your conduct is 
being seen through a biased and the misapplication and it 
20 
is not an objective reasonable assessment of the facts and 
that is a prime example of that Chair.   
And if you go over the page you will see there that  
you were quite clear Chair that you were not happy with Mr 
Gordhan’s conduct in just deciding not to come to the 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 153 of 160 
 
Commission and the reasons are well founded because the 
Commission is frustrated that it cannot ensure that people 
come when they required to come and it upsets the 
calendar and the limited time that we have is put to the 
test.  
One more Chair paragraph 54, page 54 Chair to 55 
in relation to the evidence given more recently by Mr Tsotsi 
and whether the former President arranged a meeting or 
whether the meeting was arranged by Ms Myeni.  You put it 
quite clearly there that perhaps the former President was 
10 
not involved in the arrangement of that meeting because 
he came to that meeting and immediately asked what is 
this meeting about and you looked at the probabilities 
involved in that and you said: 
“This probability points in the direction of the 
former President not being involved.” 
As I understand the evidence, there’s a host of different 
examples in these extracts, let alone, Chair, the other 
three hundred thousand odd pages that constitute the 
record.  Chair, if you would bear with me a moment? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair, there’s another example 
that’s been brought to my attention by a member of the 
legal team.  When you said, in relation to the evidence that 
was led in the Transnet stream, where you said on day 285 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 154 of 160 
 
at page 209 of the record, 
“I’m sorry Mr Myburgh please don’t forget your point 
that you want to ask, I just want to mention one 
thing arising from what I said to Mr Mkwanazi.  You 
see Mr Mkwanazi is going back to what I said last 
time, I said Mr Zuma has denied Ms Hoggin’s 
version and that he said his only choice for the 
position of Group CEO is Mr Gama.  I don’t know 
what finding I will make in the end but if Ms 
Hoggin’s version is true, then it seems that there 
10 
may be room for someone to say Mr Zuma would 
have been quite disappointed in the fact that Mr 
Gama was dismissed and had been dismissed 
because that ruled him out of the running for the 
position of Group CEO and it may well be that a 
new Minister had a discussion with him and that he 
might have mentioned that there was this issue of 
Mr Gama and he needs to look at it.  He might not 
have said, he should be reinstated but he might 
have said, he should look into it, and maybe that is 
20 
why he instructed you to review it”,  
An innocent version, again,  it strikes you during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
evidence 
that 
there 
may 
another 
explanation other than that, that the witness is contending 
for.  It doesn’t have to be your view, you raise it, and you 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 155 of 160 
 
ask questions about it as you must, with respect, Chair, as 
an inquisitor.  Then Chair, finally if I may say something 
about Commissions and the role of a Commission of 
Inquiry.   
Chair this Commission doesn’t give a judgement 
which will be a final judgement for or against any person, 
including 
the 
former 
President. 
 
Judges 
sitting 
in 
Commissions are instruments of the Executive branch of 
Government, they must establish a factual matrix on a 
particular topic, and they must make recommendations on 
10 
the basis of facts so found.  Neither the findings of fact nor 
the 
recommendations 
bind 
anybody, 
least 
of 
all 
the 
applicant for recusal whose better remedy, it is suggested, 
Chair, is a review of the findings made against him.  Chair, 
there is nothing in the papers and there’s nothing with 
respect to my learned friend in his argument, other than a 
plea to reconstitute or reorganise the manner in which the 
former President testifies before the Commission.  It’s a 
plea at misericordia that passes the legal test for recusal 
and Chair, in that circumstance, you have no discretion 
20 
even if you wished to out of deference for the former 
President you must – you cannot recuse yourself, thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
Thank 
you 
Mr 
Pretorius, 
Mr 
Sikhakhane?  Maybe, I see it’s four o’clock maybe we 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 156 of 160 
 
should take a short break, ten minutes, ja let’s – well 
earlier on we took a tea break and maybe, because of the 
numbers of people it’s difficult for everybody to come back 
on time, should I make it twenty minutes or, what do you 
think, Mr Pretorius and Mr Sikhakhane, guide me? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  I think the numbers are on Mr 
Sikhakhane's side. 
CHAIRPERSON:    [Laughter]. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair, I’m going to be very brief, 
maybe you want to take hours of a break, so I’ll give you 
10 
five minutes reply and you go home. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, then maybe – I thought you 
might…[intervenes]. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  You can take a break for 24 hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay, alright then maybe let me 
hear Mr Sikhakhane because I thought it might take long. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  I won’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV 
SIKHAKHANE: 
 
Chair, 
I 
have 
very, 
very 
few 
submissions to make.  One is to start by accepting, Chair, 
20 
as you know in the affidavit when we have no, we have no 
way to know that the person has authority as you know 
there’s counter questioning of bone fides here, we accept 
your bone fides that there’s that authority we have no 
reason not to and then, Chair, we were doing very well, 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307

you and me argued for ten – for three hours, none of us 
patronised each other, none of us assumed one of us 
doesn’t know much about something and I take serious 
exception to being patronised by Mr Pretorius, I don’t know 
how 
many 
times 
he 
said, 
we 
failed 
to 
understand 
something, it’s not true, I know no less law than he does.  
It’s not failure to understand anything, we agree on the test 
and I have a view about the test, and he has his view and 
so to say the following things.  He says, for instance, 
nowhere do we say – and I’m not re-arguing this point, 
10 
Chair, he says, nowhere they say you won’t bring an 
impartial mind.  Chair we say that in paragraph six of the 
affidavit, I’m not re-arguing the point, I’m just saying, for  a 
man accusing me of making false submissions, that’s false. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What paragraph? 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Paragraph six of the affidavit, we 
make that point.  He says, nowhere and I think it’s him 
whose making false allegations and then he says we’re 
peddling conspiracies, it’s not true.  I have put to you, 
what is in the mind of my client and what concerns him I 
20 
have not questioned the legal team about their knowledge, 
I’ve not questioned them about anything.  I’m putting to 
you what my client apprehends, and he may differ with me, 
it’s not because I don’t understand anything.   
So, that prejudice offends me and then he says, he 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 158 of 160 
 
says that I have quoted selectively.  Chair that is an 
accusation of dishonesty on my part, it’s not true, Chair, I 
could not come here with a whole record. We say, right at 
the beginning of the affidavit, that we called for you some 
of the exchanges, I could not burden you with all the 
exchanges you’ve heard, so I take serious offence to being 
patronised in this way because I was quoting to you, I 
could go on and on and we could differ about which ones 
are good and which ones are not.  So,  my quoting 
particular ones, was to demonstrate to the Chair in our 
10 
discussion about what I’d said, were issues of, perhaps 
lack of sensitivity on the part of the Chair and I could go 
on and on so I was not quoting them selectively at all there 
was no dishonesty on my part and Chair, lastly, perhaps 
this is how Mr Pretorius exposes what sits in his head. 
 
He says – and Chair this is not you, you’ve not said 
this I accept all the arguments you made against me.  He 
says, sarcastically, 
“Maybe Zuma has reasonable apprehension that 
there may be findings against him”, 
20 
 
Chair, that is just an insult and unfair because it 
questions Mr Zuma’s bone fides for no reason, that’s not 
what he fears, he fears no finding and so this conspiracy 
itself is a problem.  He has told you, Chair, his fears and 
he has told you that he does not fear any finding, but he is 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 159 of 160 
 
told by the evidence leader that, that is what he fears.  So, 
I want to say, Chair, I’ve stated to you – and there’s no 
point that I make that I’m going to pull back on, those 
arguments are what they are, I understand the test that he 
thinks I don’t understand, and Chair, you have the 
responsibility to assess it, find against us if you must, I 
can see he wants to take the Stalingrad approach, he 
does, and let him do it, we’ll see who wins but we must be 
constructive about this and it’s that attitude, Chair, that I 
think has made difficult for your Commission, it’s not you 
10 
mostly, it’s the attitude that, I think, has a particular slant 
against Mr Zuma and doubting us and I don’t even know 
what the prejudice is of doubting our bone fides and 
knowledge, it just offends me, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you Mr Sikhakhane.  We are 
going to adjourn for the day, and we’ll resume tomorrow 
morning at ten.  I’m going to use the evening and the night 
to consider all these submissions that have been made by 
both sides.  The idea will be to try and arrive at a decision 
as soon as possible but we will see when I arrive 
20 
tomorrow, what the position is.   So, I would like to be able 
to give my decision tomorrow at ten but if by that time, it’s 
not ready I’ll be here and then, indicate what the position 
is but I’ll use the – I will consider, overnight all these 
submissions.  Don’t forget, Mr Sikhakhane to let me have 
16 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 307 
 
Page 160 of 160 
 
your written submissions but I would like to see counsel 
once I’ve adjourned, ja both sides. 
ADV SIKHAKHANE:  Chair, thank you so much, thank you 
for listening to this difficult application. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you.  Alright, we are going to 
adjourn then, and we’ll resume tomorrow morning at ten.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
