PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 13 AUGUST 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are supposed to deal with Ms Jiba’s 
application for Leave to Cross-examine Mr Agrizzi? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Both parties are represented and 
perhaps the order should be the applicant representatives, the 
respondent and then I will make some comments at the end. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should be quite quick.   
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  I confirm my appearance on behalf of Advocate 
Jiba.  The name is Z Majavu spelt M-a-j-a-v-u for the record and I am 
assisted [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Majavu I think your voice is very soft 
you might wish to raise it 
20 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Let me try again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Chair.  I confirm my appearance on Advocate – 
on behalf of Advocate Jiba. My name is Zola Majavu spelt M-a-j-a-v-u 
for the record and I am assisted by my associated Ms Makuta surname 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 3 of 113 
 
spelt M-a-k-u-t-a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  As it pleases the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another appearance? 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  I am Julie Ann Howard I confirm my 
appearance on behalf of Mr Agrizzi in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Majavu. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Thank you Chair.  Might I request the Chair’s 
liberty to indulge us rather to hand up a bundle which I have prepared 
for ease of reference?  I have already shared it with my learned friends 
on behalf of the evidence leaders as well as Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  It is purely for practical purposes because as at 
yesterday I had not received an index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  From the commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  But my colleagues indicate that they had 
received an index and I would request that we rather work off that one.  
It is a consolidation of the application and necessary documentation.  
The last two items is basically the letter in which the Chair had 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 4 of 113 
 
requested to ask to indicate whether or not there is an objection.  At 
the time the Chair was minded to hear this in chambers and we did not 
object. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And the subsequent document at the bottom 
thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Is simply today’s notice of set down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Other than that the documents that form part of 
10 
that bundle are pretty much [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the same. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  The same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And are common cause between the parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No initially I thought I should just deal with it in 
chambers if nobody has a problem but I subsequent thought it might be 
good if we deal with it in an open hearing. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am glad that everyone has been able to come 
20 
even though we did not give a long notice. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  That is very much in order it is in the nature of 
the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  That we are dealing with and we take no issue 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 5 of 113 
 
with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously I – obviously I have read the papers and I 
just want to mention to you where – what my prima facie thinking is so 
that you do not have to deal with all kinds of matters that are really not 
of my concern.  My concern is that Mr Agrizzi as far as I can see in his 
affidavit, main affidavit does say that he has no personal knowledge 
that any bribes were paid to Ms Jiba.  All he is saying is that he 
interacted with Mr Mti and he and Mr Gavin Watson they interacted with 
10 
Mr Mti and Mr Mr Mti told him certain things including that some of the 
money was destined for Ms Jiba.  So obviously Ms Jiba also does not 
know whether Mr Mti said to Mr Agrizzi what Mr Agrizzi’s says he said 
to him.  Just like Mr Agrizzi does not know whether indeed Mr Mti had 
any discussions with Mr – with Ms Jiba and whether he handed over 
any monies.  So my difficulty is that: 
1. I do not see how Ms Jiba can cross-examine Mr Agribbi about 
those – Mr Agrizzi about those payments in any way that assist 
the commission.  You know.  Nor can she as I see it cross-
examine him ineffectively or in any way that assist the 
20 
commission about whether indeed Mr Mti told Mr Agrizzi what Mr 
Agrizzi says he told him, you know. 
So I have that difficulty.  The investigations of the commission are 
ongoing and – and I believe that Mr Mti will come to the commission in 
due course and give his evidence.  If for example he says yes I did say 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 6 of 113 
 
what Mr Agrizzi says I said about Mr Jiba – Ms Jiba and indeed I did 
hand over some monies to Ms Jiba.  It seems to me that that is the 
person that may be – could be a good candidate for Ms Jiba’s cross-
examination in a way that could assist the commission. You know.  So 
there are those concerns.  But obviously that does not affect the other 
part of what the application is about namely she would like leave to 
give evidence herself and say that she never gave, accepted or 
received any money from Bosasa or Mr Mti.  That stands on a different 
footing you know.  Even if Mr Agrizzi does not know whether money was 
paid to her I would be inclined to say well let her come and say I never 
10 
got any money from Bosasa or from Mr Mti you know.  So I do not have 
a problem with that part I just have a problem with the part for cross-
examination.  So that is where my concern is. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Chair firstly thank you for those observations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  One had anticipated that that is what would 
possibly trouble the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And I will attempt to deal with those concerns 
and perhaps put a different spin to it to the extent that really what one 
20 
seeks to do is to preserve one’s clients’ integrity and that is the 
starting point.  And I take comfort in the fact that right at the initial 
stages of the commencement of this proceeding amongst others Chair 
you indicated that this is about the pursuit of truth and this is also 
anchored on the rule of law with less adherence to formalism.  But it 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 7 of 113 
 
could not be that parties rights can be you know compromised or 
prejudiced at the altar of expediency.  With that said let me attempt to 
answer the concerns in two parts.  Firstly we would not be 
presumptuous and assume that in the course of business the 
commission would in fact call Mr Mti and whether and not Mr Mti would 
oblige accordingly.  We are here on the back of a Rule 3.3 Notice that 
was served on our client and it is that which prompted us to come.  And 
in the self-same notice it indicated the various rights to which our client 
could avail herself.  The first part was obviously to take issue with the 
allegations made by Mr Agrizzi through his mouth in an open 
10 
commission for all and sundry to watch him and hear him.  The second 
aspect to the right about which I will spend less time is saying to the 
extent that my client wants to test the truthfulness or otherwise of what 
Mr Agrizzi himself says on affidavit and repeated in an open 
commission she would like to test that.  But over and above that she is 
not arrogant enough to say I want to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi but I 
myself do not want to be cross-examined.  That was really the point of 
departure.  On the affidavit which form part of the Rule 3.3 I am the 
first to concede that whatever Mr Agrizzi says is largely hearsay?  He 
repeated it in an open commission.  We responded substantively with 
20 
Ms Jiba’s version to which he had an opportunity to respond or to reply 
which he did and reasserted the hearsay evidence on which his initial 
submissions were based.  And to come closer to the point that Chair 
you are making is we issued an invitation to him having now read his 
second affidavit so to speak.  The first one let us call it the first 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 8 of 113 
 
affidavit because that was what was attached to the Rule 3.3.  Upon us 
bringing a substantive application the evidence leaders rightly so gave 
him a copy of what Advocate Jiba had to say.  He then replied with a 
further affidavit, the second affidavit and from the gleaning thereof we 
realised that this entire process might even be obviated for the reasons 
that Chair you have rightly observed.  And we issued an invitation and 
that invitation for want of a better word would be contained in Item 7 
which is paginated pages on our bundle 40 through to 42.  It is 
basically a letter wherein we say look we have read what Mr Agrizzi has 
to say.  This is all hearsay and we are inviting him to retract that in an 
10 
open forum where he made those allegations.  Had that been made we 
would not be here.  But that invitation was not accepted so we had to 
follow through with the application that we believe we rightly made.  
And that is the point.  The second issue is with regard to her testimony 
in person she had taken the view that look I have given my version.  It 
is not disputed in any material way by Mr Agrizzi himself so I do not 
really think that there is a need for me to even go ahead and testify 
unless other persons who may implicate me more directly may come to 
the commission in the fullness of time which is beyond her control.  And 
we came here on the back of that and that is the understanding.  Why 
20 
we believe that you are partially correct with respect Chair in saying 
perhaps there is little utility that may be derived in the robust cross-
examination of a man who says I do not have personal knowledge I said 
what I said because other people told me so.  But that may well be the 
case.  But it is the manner in which those were made in public in this 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 9 of 113 
 
forum that we believe that it causes our client serious [indistinct] 
prejudice.  The reputational damage as a result of what Mr Agrizzi said 
continues unabated to date and it is that mischief which she sought to 
deal with even on a limited basis.  Even if Mr Agrizzi were to come and 
say openly before the world that I have no personal knowledge I only 
conveyed that which I heard from other people.  We would have been 
happy with that and leave it at that Chair.  And obviously we are also 
mindful of the fact that whatever we do and say must be aimed at 
assisting the commission.  But the chorology also applies.  The 
collateral damage that was done while people rightly or wrongly 
10 
believed they are being of assistance to the commission sight cannot 
be lost of that.  And it may appear to be minutia but it is a matter of 
central importance for my client to say Mr Agrizzi accused me.  He 
asserted certain facts.  Even in his second affidavit he still says I deny 
that I implicated her erroneously.  He is not taking the view that look it 
is what it is and I am happy to accept that I might have been 
misinformed myself.  It may well be that under cross-examination he 
may give better context that may better assist the commission in terms 
of what is it that made him assert as facts that which he has asserted 
with specific reference to Advocate Jiba?  So it is a matter of sufficient 
20 
importance goes to the core of her own constitutional rights.  Just as 
much as Mr Agrizzi was within his rights to come here and assist the 
commission and implicate others I hold no brief for others I hold a brief 
for Advocate Jiba implicate her in the manner that he did openly.  You 
see Chair what is unfortunate about this is the fact that at the time 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 10 of 113 
 
when these allocations were made she was a serious holder of a very 
key constitutional office which unfortunately as fate had it and it has 
nothing to do with you Chair.  But at the time when these allegations 
were made there was already a similar process which was established 
precisely to look into her fitness to hold office and the allegations that 
Mr Agrizzi made if found to be true had a direct impact on her fitness to 
hold office and it was an invitation which was issued to all and sundry.  
And as fate had it Chair a day or so before that enquiry was to 
commence what Mr Agrizzi was due to say here had already been 
leaked to the media.  We took the Judge in that enquiry info confidence 
10 
and said Judge to the extent that these are allegations that you might 
have read about over the weekend we admit that they fall on all fours 
with your terms of reference.  We placing it on record so that in the 
fullness of time it may well be put as evidence before you and then we 
can deal with it at that forum.  In fairness to Justice Mokgoro she 
acknowledged that it is not evidence before her but it could not just be 
ignored as if it did not happen.  Evidence was then placed before that 
inquiry with the assistance of this commission and arrangements were 
then made for Mr Agrizzi to come and testify before the Mokgoro Inquiry 
at which the credibility or otherwise should have been tested there in 
20 
that particular forum.  Mr Agrizzi’s lawyers are sitting to my left.  An 
agreement was made that he would testify.  We pencilled in dates and 
on the eve thereof he had a Damascus Road experience and decided 
that no he is not going to subject himself to that process because he is 
scared that he might incriminate himself.  Unlike you Chair the Mokgoro 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 11 of 113 
 
Inquiry did not cede with the force of compulsion.  So when he said no I 
am not making we all had to lick our wounds and accept that it is what 
it is hoping that he would at the very least be amenable to coming back 
to this commission at which those allegations were made and then we 
can deal with them subject to your directions.  We accepted it on that 
basis that we still have another alternative remedy at which this issues 
which are of public importance can then be tested.  It is against the 
background that we would persist with our request even on that narrow 
basis because what Mr Agrizzi has done with respect and I – I cast no 
aspersions on my colleagues’ on behalf of the evidence leaders.  They 
10 
shared with us what he had to say on Advocate Jiba’s affidavit.  We 
then said look if the man can say this is just hearsay we would have 
accepted that and possibly withdrawn that part of our application or 
dealt with it differently.  Now we sitting in a situation where that 
affidavit again where he restates that this is you know hearsay.  It was 
done between us it was not done publicly and that is where my client’s 
difficult would be.  We are not suggesting that we should use this as a 
forum to ventilate her personal feelings but it is the essence of what 
was said here publicly by Mr Agrizzi that we believe that we are entitled 
to cross-examine him on even on that very limited and narrow basis.  
20 
However if the Chair is inclined to say look reserve your client’s rights 
to deal with Mr Agrizzi as well as Mr Mti and any other in relation to 
that which Mr Agrizzi relays as second or third hand knowledge that 
may well be another practical way of dealing with it but I would have 
been remiss if I had not stated categorically what really [indistinct] my 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 12 of 113 
 
client with regard to this conduct by Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Majavu I think that you have addressed 
issues very pertinently and very usefully if I may add.  I think we are 
not far apart.  With regard to what Mr Agrizzi said to the commission 
when he gave evidence and his – in his statement anybody who was 
listening and anybody who reads this statement will know that Mr 
Agrizzi did not say and does not say that I have personal knowledge of 
money being paid to Ms Jiba by Bosasa or Mr Mti handing over money.  
That all he is saying is according to Mr Mti in effect some of the money 
that we – that we were handing over to him was destined to Ms Jiba 
10 
and I do not know whether he goes to the extent of saying Mr Mti said 
he was paying it over or not but certainly he says that Mti said part of 
the money was money he was going to hand over.  And he makes it 
clear he was never anywhere where he saw it being handed over.  I 
accept that even that being said in a public hearing is not something 
that anyone would like to be said about them. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I accept that.  But of course you know in a forum 
such as this some of the things that are said will be hearsay.  The rules 
are not as strict as in a court of law but we must always be sensitive 
20 
and I think we try to be sensitive all the time to the things that are 
being said by other people about other people.  So my – my inclination 
is that insofar as payment of money is concerned my inclination is – is 
to dismiss the application to cross-examine.  Or if we think that it might 
be better to postpone it and deal with it maybe when other witnesses 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 13 of 113 
 
might have come forward.  But I certainly intend to grant Ms Jiba leave 
to give evidence if she wants to in regard to any allegation even if it is 
a hearsay allegation that she may have received bribes.  But it may be 
that her evidence may be more conveniently heard when other 
witnesses such as Mr Mti have given evidence so that then she can 
deal with everything.  Or she might decide that there is no need for her 
to give evidence if for example Mr Mti said: 
1. I never said what Mr Agrizzi said I said to him. 
2. I never paid any money over to Ms Jiba for bribes. 
But it is a decision she can take later on.  But I am simply saying that 
10 
in regard to that one I do not have a problem granting leave.  I do have 
concerns about this other one and I am thinking – I am inclined to 
either dismiss it now or if – or say let us postpone it and deal with it 
once other witnesses have come forward and we have heard what they 
say.  I do not know what your – what your submissions might be on 
that. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Thank you Chair.  Firstly it is not only about the 
payment or receipt of bribes that Mr Agrizzi lays at the door of 
Advocate Jiba and more sensitively on account of her position in the 
National Prosecuting Authority.  He also accuses her of obstruction of 
20 
justice because he makes allegations that she somehow leaked 
sensitive information relating to the Bosasa investigations.  So that is a 
self-standing criticism again which is placed on a higher footing I 
submit because if the person who is supposed to be prosecuting not 
necessarily personally but who is in that office then dishes out 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 14 of 113 
 
information that may tend to undermine that prosecution.  That is a 
serious – that is a serious matter.  So that is the second issue.  And 
thirdly you see Chair ordinarily I would have no hesitation agreeing 
with the inclination that you are expressing at this stage because it is 
sensible but the difficulty here is if you have regard and I will just 
invite Chair to journey with me to his second affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And you will see in there he is seeking to 
bolster… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes I saw that actually I meant to raise that with 
10 
you. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  So it is not something that we can just gloss over 
and say on the one hand he says, no it is hearsay bla, bla, bla but 
when he comes back the second time around he ever amplifies that 
which he says might have amplified his thinking or the inference that he 
may have rightly or wrongly arrived at.  And if we had left that 
unchallenged it would not be open to us later to say ja but with regard 
to the bribes it is in the pocket nobody understands him to have said he 
20 
has personal knowledge of that but he put it out there.  But let us park 
that aside.  What about the documents?  He goes chapter and verse 
about the documents and how he believes that – in fact he asserts that 
she would have had access to these documents trying to draw a 
correlation in saying that which Mti said was how they received the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 15 of 113 
 
documents must be reasonably possibly true because look at this?  He 
introduces the issue of the Mercedes Benz for the first time but with all 
of that said Chair I will conclude by indicating what my stance is on the 
prima facie inclination.  But you see Chair the difficulty that we are 
going to have we are here on account of a specific Rule 3.3.  If we had 
not dealt with it timeously and took the stance that let us await 
everybody else to come and testify we are going to tread into 
dangerous seas. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I agree. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  So pragmatically Chair we had to be seen to be 
10 
respecting that invitation by you to say here are these allegations and 
at the time when that invitation was made it was clear even then that 
we dealing with hearsay evidence.  So we could not say on a mere 
reading of this affidavit anybody can see that he does not say that but 
it was a serious allegation that we had to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Then to the point.  Chair I would rather you do 
not dismiss now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  We have made the point. 
20 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Let this application perhaps stand over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  To when everybody else that may potentially 
corroborate Mr Agrizzi. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 16 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Has either done that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Or disabused themselves of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And then we can then come back and say Chair 
now that Mr Mti for example or Mr Watson has now had their say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  This is what our inclination is so that I do not 
leave my client high and dry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And close all these doors for her it would have 
been irresponsible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  For us not to have approached you but there is 
absolutely nothing sensibly and legally wrong with that prima facie 
inclination.  With that qualification Chair that our client’s rights should 
remain reserved and let us deal with it on the basis that in the fullness 
of time we will still come back because we now know as the Chair has 
observed that at least he is relying on hearsay evidence he is not 
20 
asserting it personally to the extent that he seems to do so in his 
second affidavit my client’s rights remain reserved.  We will have no 
difficulty abiding that type of order Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I - I think that is in order.  I will be inclined 
to do - to do that.  I will - I doubt that anybody has any problem with - 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 17 of 113 
 
with that.  So I think that and - and I also need to just say that nothing 
that I have said should be construed as any - as criticism for the fact 
that you - you filed an application for leave to cross-examine Ms Jiba. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Agrizzi.  I am sorry.  Mr Agrizzi.  There is no 
criticism at all for - for that and you had to respond to the Rule 3.3 
notice in - in a way that you believe it was correct and I think many 
people would have responded the way you did.  So - so I - I do not 
think there is a problem with it. 
It is just that once I have to decide whether to grant leave or 
10 
not I have to consider all of these matters and we then take it from 
there but the - the point you have made with regard to what you have 
referred to as the - defeating the ends of justice may need closer 
examination than the allegation about whether Ms Jiba was paid bribes 
or not. 
So it might need closer examination next time when we look 
at the matter. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Chair then as a parting shot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Purely for context and I raise this because it was 
20 
contained in the second affidavit by - by Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  In - in the quest for the pursuit of truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  I - I would humbly urge and without being 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 18 of 113 
 
prescriptive on the investigators … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  On how they do their job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  To - to also pay closer scrutiny to these new 
allegations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  That he amplifies in his second affidavit because 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  That is also what could have potentially you 
know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Bedevilled the waters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  So to speak because you are an MP official. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  First you are accused of a bribe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Then you are called a snake … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And then new issues are introduced after you 
have played open cards with the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  It also deals with the circumstances pertaining to 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 19 of 113 
 
the flow of documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  It is - it is a very central issue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Because in his replying affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And Chair you can look at it at your own 
convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have looked at actually. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Oh, okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  He keeps referring to either Mti … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Lesenga (?). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  There is also a conjunctive and a disjunctive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And/or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And that is where my client gets drawn in … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And it is something that I am flagging now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  To say when we do come back we are not going 
to take it lying down … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 20 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Because it does cast aspersions on her good 
integrity but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  We leave it at that and I am happy with the - the 
direction that Chair you and I have debated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  It does make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I must say that with regard to the matter that 
Mr Agrizzi raises in what you call the second affidavit what is that now? 
10 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the matter that Mr Agrizzi raises for 
the first time in what you call the second affidavit I did take note of - of 
it when I was looking at this affidavit.  I have actually directed that an 
investigation should be conducted into it.  More information should be 
obtained as to it because as you say if it were true it could be seen as 
bolstering the other allegations. 
So - so there would be investigations because in regard to 
that one he seems to be speaking more from personal knowledge … 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Than with regard to the other allegations.  So that 
one may well also stand on a different footing.  I saw that you - you 
wrote a letter to say it is hearsay blah, blah, blah but I have said it 
should be investigated and obviously you would be contacted if there is 
more … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 21 of 113 
 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that comes out and - and then your client can 
give her version and then when we deal with the matter next time it may 
be that even if I were to say in regard to the allegations of bribery I do 
not grant leave to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi but in regard to that one I 
may well grant leave but it is something we would discuss at that stage. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  That is fair Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And for avoidance of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Of doubt my client has emphatically instructed 
me to place on record that she has absolutely no difficulty cooperating 
with the Commission and she actually welcomes that type of 
investigation.  So that when she does respond it is also not on a 
piecemeal basis … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Because it is not of assistance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Either to her … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Or to - to the Commission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And the Chair should also note that even with 
regard to this particular Rule 3.3 notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 22 of 113 
 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  I place it on record simply to demonstrate the 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  She was given a truncated notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  However the investigators and perhaps with the 
evidence leaders … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Explained to her … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Why it was necessary to give her a shortened 
notice … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And an explanation that she accepted and 
nevertheless cooperated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  With everybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  So it should not be seen as if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  She is shying away from dealing with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  We are merely asserting her rights … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And it is something that I am duty bound … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 23 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  To do and also be guided … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  By what is pragmatic … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  And for that I am grateful Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Unless there are any other issues that would be 
where I propose to leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No there are no other issues Mr Majavu save that I do 
10 
want to say that I appreciate the very constructive approach you have 
adopted in presenting your argument and in protecting your client’s 
rights without in anyway making it difficult for the Commission to do its 
job.  I think you - you strike that balance very well. 
So I am grateful for - for that as well.  We - we see a lot of 
that among practitioners who come before the Commission but there 
are exceptions where we do not see that.  So - so thank you - thank 
you very much. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  I have been well trained.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let me hear counsel representing 
20 
Mr Agrizzi whether she has any objection to what we have tentatively 
agreed should happen.  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got any difficulty with what I am inclined to 
do with which Mr Majavu has no problem? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 24 of 113 
 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  No.  Thus fair we do - we do not have any 
issues with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  My main submissions today were going to 
relate to the allegations of the hearsay evidence and the fact that in 
the event that Mr Mti is actually called it would no longer be hearsay 
evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Because obviously he would confirm it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  I was further just going to make the 
submission that in the event that he is not called and he does not 
actually give the evidence and it remains hearsay evidence.  In terms 
of the Commission’s Rules I believe it is Rule 6.1 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  The Commission is still entitled to accept 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Evidence which is not normally admissibly 
in an ordinary court … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Which obviously it would constitute 
hearsay evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  It would just be this Commission’s 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 25 of 113 
 
prerogative to attach as much weight as it deems fit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  To the evidence that was tendered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that - that is - that is fine.  So there is no 
problem from your side? 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  It is just with regards to the allegation of 
Ms Jiba being referred to as snake.  In Mr Agrizzi’s testimony that was 
actually offered in front of this Commission he explained that it was not 
10 
any sort of a derogative nickname.  It was just a code name that was 
given and he actually explained what Mr Mti said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - well it - it might be a code name but it - it is a 
code name that nobody would like to be associated with.  So - so that - 
that - that does not really help alright. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Yes.  He just - he explained the reason 
behind it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was a code name and Mr Majavu - Mr Majavu 
has indicated and Ms Jiba has indicated that she took - takes offence 
it. 
20 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  The last point I would just like to make is 
that Mr Agrizzi has emphatically said that he would be happy to abide 
by any ruling that this Commission makes in this regard … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 26 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  And also he further just confirms that the 
evidence that he has tendered was for the most part told to him.  He 
did not have personal knowledge of it.  So to cross-examine someone 
who does not have personal knowledge of what might have transpired 
might - might take this Commission just on a bit of detour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  It might waste a bit of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Again as - as - as Chair mentioned earlier 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  The actual person to be answering these 
questions would probably be Messieurs Mti or Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  No thank you. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Other than that I have no further 
submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Is there anything else the Chair wishes I 
address? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing, thank you. 
ADV JULIE ANN HOWARD:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius I guess you have nothing to 
say? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes.  Save - save Chair that 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 27 of 113 
 
because in the fullness of time direct all circumstantial evidence may 
assist in asserting the truth of the essential dispute about the payment 
or receipt of money.  No order should be made which should exclude 
the possibility of a renewed application for cross-examination by 
Ms Jiba even of Mr Agrizzi because of the circumstantial nature for 
example the delay in prosecution, the receipt of documents and the 
like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  No, no that is fine.  The - the application 
will not need to be renewed because it is not going to be dismissed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  I see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it will simply be heard at a later stage maybe with 
or without supplementary papers depending on what is going to happen. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  In short the possibility of a 
necessity to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi may arise in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the situation might be different when we look at 
it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we are not going to … 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS:  Nothing further to add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dismiss it.  Thank you.  Having heard argument on 
behalf of Ms Jiba order I make in this matter is that Ms Jiba’s 
application for leave to cross-examine Ms - Mr Agrizzi is postponed 
sine die and may be set down at a later - at a stage when other 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 28 of 113 
 
witnesses have given evidence relating to Bosasa and at that stage as 
is always the case notice will be given to all parties concerned.  The 
application is therefore postponed sine die.  Thank you very much.  So 
we are done with that.  I think we will take an adjournment to allow the 
team that is going to lead the evidence of the next witness in the Estina 
matter to get everybody ready for that.  Thank you. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  May I then taken it that we are accordingly 
excused (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused.  Yes thank you. 
ADV ZOLA MAJAVU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will - we will adjourn for 10 minutes.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are supposed to have resumed about twenty five 
past ten and we did not do so because I needed to have a meeting with 
the Legal Team on various witnesses so to make up for that as far as 
we can we are not going to take the tea break, we will run through until 
20 
one o’clock.   
 
Yes Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, and morning again Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman we have – we had originally 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 29 of 113 
 
intended to call two witnesses today, with your leave we are asking that 
we only call one witness because of some technical issues and matters 
that we would like to discuss with the second witness, just to be sure 
that the material that is presented is in fact the material he wants to 
have presented to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There is a little bit of a technical glitch 
there Chairman so we ask that we only lead the evidence of one 
witness today and with the other witness we will reschedule when he 
returns and by that time I think we will have resolved what I really think 
10 
are technical issues that must be resolved, because he is more 
comfortable with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine.  We will do this, we will do that, let us 
deal with one witness for today.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you, as it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Ms Buthelezi will be leading the evidence 
of the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes Ms Buthelezi? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Chair my witness for today is Mr Moremi.  
20 
Mr Moremi is the former Municipal Manager for Phumelela Municipality 
where the Estina Dairy Farm was located.  May I ask that this witness 
be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 30 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Tekoetsile Moses Moremi. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please raise your 
right hand and say so help me God. 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   So help me God. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   (duly sworn, states) 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Chair Mr Moremi has given us an affidavit 
that was given to the Chair yesterday.  He has now gave us a 
supplementary statement which has also been added to the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes do you want this bundle to be admitted and 
marked? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes as Exhibit HH12. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The file containing the statement of Mr Moremi will 
be marked Exhibit HH12, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Moremi there is a 
bundle HH12 in front of you, if you turn below the number one, do you 
confirm that the document that appears is the affidavit that you made 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 31 of 113 
 
for the Commission? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   And if you go further backwards, below the 
big number two under the divider do you confirm that, that is the 
supplementary statement that you made today? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Ms Buthelezi, if he went backwards and I think 
to get to divider number two he had to go forwards not backwards. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, I’m sorry Chair, yes but do you 
10 
confirm that, that is the statement that is marked Exhibit HH12 from 
pages 1 until 4, is the statement that you made today? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes I confirm Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   It’s dated on page 4. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes I confirm Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  Mr Moremi would you please 
then give us your employment history within the Free State 
Government? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Thank you Chair.  On the 15 t h of 
January 2011 I joined the Municipality – Phumelela Local Municipality 
20 
as the Chief Financial Officer, before then I was working for the 
banking institution called Absa and I was the Regional Manager who 
was responsible for the portfolio on the Free State Province and then 
on the 1 s t of May 2012, I was fortunate Chair, and I was appointed as 
the Municipal Manager of Phumelela Local Municipality and that 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 32 of 113 
 
coincided with the period when the Vrede Integrated Dairy Project was 
– when it was started to be implemented, and then – later then resigned 
and joined the Free State Provincial Treasury as the Chief Director, 
which is the position that I’m currently holding now. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes and when did you start in that 
position? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I started on the 17 t h of February 
2014. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, Mr Moremi will you please give 
us your qualifications – your highest qualifications? 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   My highest qualification is B-Com 
Accounting, I also do have a Diploma in Human Resource Management 
and quite a number of certificates including the certificates of minimum 
competence which it’s the requirement from National Treasury for 
anybody that is working for a Municipality to have that particular 
certificate. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, Chair for the purposes of 
leading Mr Moremi’s evidence I will go through both, his original 
affidavit and the supplementary because some of the information that 
he gives on the original, runs over to the supplementary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’ll refer to both simultaneously. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   I’ll refer to both simultaneously yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  Mr Moremi in your 
supplementary statement you give us a brief history about the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 33 of 113 
 
ownership of this Krynaauwslust farm that is in Vrede, would you 
please give us that history? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Thank you Chair.  When I joined 
the Municipality in 2011 as a Chief Financial Officer, what was 
expected of me was to make it a point – and those rules and 
responsibilities are clearly defined in Section 81 of the Municipal 
Finance Management Act, is to make sure that we account for all the 
assets, expenditure and the revenue of the Municipality.  So when I was 
going through the asset registry of the Municipality that time, I then 
noticed that the Municipality owns a farm called Krynaauwslust.  That 
10 
farm was acquired around 1893 and I must indicate Chair, that the 
town, Vrede and township, Thembalihle are also in that particular farm.  
The farm is measuring 4 439, that is the total…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hectares? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Hectares, ja, by that time the – I 
noticed that the far was then leased on a 99 year agreement to the 
Krynaauwslust Boerdery Trust.  Chair that particular Krynaauwslust 
Boerdery Trust was, according to the records that I’ve seen was 
established in 1993 and it was established through the councillors by 
that time during that period of the transitional local council.  The 
20 
councillors by that time, those are the ones who actually established 
that particular Trust, so it was actually operating as a Trust for the 
community by that time but in 1993 then this entity was then 
established just a year before the democratic dispensation and council 
by that time then took a resolution to then lease this particular farm for 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 34 of 113 
 
a period of 99 years and that 99 years was fro 1993 and in that farm it 
was the livestock, the farming equipment and everything was 
there…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that have been an all white council at that 
time? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   It was all white councillors Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   So when I started requesting 
financial information the – because I just joined the Municipality in 
2011, when I start asking the – because it was a Municipal entity, 
10 
asking for the audited financial statements and the records from the 
accountant then, I found it very difficult to get those particular records 
because I had to make it a point that we account for the revenue from 
that particular farm because it is the Municipality’s farm.  So I had 
some difficulties there getting the audited financial statement, to an 
extent that – because then I was pursuing it, to an extent that the 
Trustees, it was during that 2011 instead of giving me the audited 
financial statement, they then decided to sell the cattle and the 
equipment, we were not part of that particular auction and later then 
dissolved the Trust.  So I even requested [indistinct] can I have the 
20 
audited financial statement up until the dissolution of the Trust, I could 
not get them and even when I left in 2014 there were no financial 
statement, audited for that particular Trust, so there was absolutely no 
accounting records for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me just understand, was the Trust created by the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 35 of 113 
 
council? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was created by the council. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:      It was created by the council. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there would have been a resolution of council 
saying a Trust must be created for this and that purpose? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Trustees, how were they identified or 
selected? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Trustees, Chair, were councillors 
10 
of that Municipality at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At that time? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Ja, those councillors were then 
the Trustees of this particular Trust. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But as you understood the – I guess at some stage 
you got, well you would have got hold of the deed of Trust, did the first 
Trustees have to cease to be Trustees when they ceased to councillors 
and then others would take over or was the position that those who 
were the first Trustees just continued even when they were no longer 
councillors? 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair let me place it on record 
that, those are some of the difficulties that I actually encountered 
because I did request for the Trust deed but I couldn’t find any record, 
the same as the financial statement.  So I couldn’t understand exactly 
what was – what happened subsequent to those councillors ceasing to 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 36 of 113 
 
be then councillors after 1994. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you didn’t approach the Master of the High Court 
because a copy – well the original actually, that’s where it would be? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I didn’t Chair but I think if one 
can still go through the records of the Municipality we might be able to 
get the Trust deed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because every Trust gets registered with the 
Master of the High Court in the particular province or division and he or 
she is the one who issues letters of executorship which gives powers to 
the Trustees to act as Trustees without the letters of executorship from 
10 
the Master of the High Court they don’t have power to do anything.  So 
that’s where you go if you can’t get it anywhere then a copy can be 
found but the long and short of it, is that you asked for a deed – a 
copy, you were not given and instead the livestock was sold and the 
Trust was dissolved? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair, there was an amount 
of approximately R8million that was actually paid into the Municipality’s 
account after that particular auction but in terms of how they arrived at 
that R8million, because we did not even have the list of the stock, I’m 
talking about the livestock that were in that particular auction, how 
20 
much was each livestock sold for, so those details were not available, it 
was only R8million that came into the account and they then reported 
that, this is the proceeds from the sale of the livestock and that money 
was then accrued to the Municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would have thought that you would have told 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 37 of 113 
 
the council, the existing council at the time, here is this problem, the 
Mayor and so on and they would have assisted you to get the 
information because it would have also been their job to try and find 
out because they must look after the interest of the Municipality.  Did 
you tell them you were having these difficulties? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair, I did inform the Mayor 
by that time that – because there were some letters…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was Mr Motaung? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   It was Mr T J Motaung ja, I told 
him that I’m having difficulties in getting that particular information 
10 
from the – from the accountant who was part of this particular Trust.  
So I did, I did inform – but I don’t think the Mayor could get because 
that – his name, the accountant, if I’m correct Chair it was Mr Jakwaya, 
he was just a very difficult person who did not want to cooperate and 
did not want to give any information.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you didn’t get much support from the council and 
the Mayor to try and get to the bottom of this? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No I had indicated to the Mayor 
who then that he’ll also try from his side to try and check how he can 
get those documents but Chair I must be honest, that at the end, I 
20 
ended up not getting anything from Mr Jakwaya. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   So the R8million is the only amount that 
you received from this Trust when it was dissolved in 2011? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Ja that is the only money that 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 38 of 113 
 
was paid into the Municipality’s account subsequent to that particular 
auction that was held and I must indicate and place it on record that 
none of the municipal officials were part of that particular auction. If 
I’m not mistaken, when I was going through the records there was an 
Afrikaans article that was actually placed, where the details and the 
date of the auction was placed, it was just in that Afrikaans newspaper 
so you could see that it was actually not open for everybody but ja, we 
got R8million but as to whether this is really the amount that accrued to 
the Municipality by then, I can’t confirm because that was supposed to 
be confirmed through audited financial statements. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it’s very strange because you say the Trust had 
been established in 1993, so by 2011 you were close to 20 years of its 
existence and therefore there should have been a lot of documentation 
relating to the activities of the Trust over the 18 years or so that it has 
been in existence and what money it was bringing to the Municipality as 
well and financial statements and everything because it was a council 
Trust, it was accountable to the council, to the Municipality.  So there’s 
the question of what were the different councils that were established 
over the 18 years, what were they doing about finding out what was 
happening about this Trust and to the extent that the position was that 
20 
the farm had been leased to this Trust or to whoever it was leased to 
over this period, where was the rent going, was there rent that was paid 
and to whom was it going and what were they doing with it.  Because 
from what you say it looks unlikely that it was coming to the council, 
you didn’t pick up anything that showed that any rent was paid to the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 39 of 113 
 
council? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No, no nothing Chair and even 
that time I engaged the Municipal Manager at that time, just to try and 
check whether there were regular financial reports presented to council 
on the performance of that particular – because yes it was 100% owned 
by the Municipality so surely there was supposed to have been regular 
records presented to council even giving details in terms of the 
movement of the livestock and whatever else.  So those records should 
have been there, but Chair, when I joined the Municipality in 2011 there 
was none of those but it was my obligation as a Chief Financial Officer 
10 
to make it a point that any asset that is in the Municipality is properly 
accounted for – I requested those particular details ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Auditor General hadn’t picked it up as far as 
you know, over the years? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair, I think – I’m just talking 
out of correction because I was not there, in fact when I joined the 
Municipality there were consultants that were appointed by the 
Municipality they were assisting in the preparation of the financial 
statement, I then also asked them that particular information and I 
couldn’t get it.  I also asked the Auditor General by that time as 
20 
whether there is anything they have and I couldn’t get anything else 
Chair because it was bothering me that, you cannot have such an 
important asset of the Municipality, that is operating, and I mean if you 
check the period exactly when it was operating, and yet there are no 
records even indicating whether dividends and anything. So it was 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 40 of 113 
 
really a concern to me Chair but all went in vain so I couldn’t get any 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well the matter should not rest there, steps 
should be taken to see whether there may be any corruption involved in 
regard to that because the Commission has to look at issues of  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   We have noted it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, Mr Moremi was there any 
assets that remained when the Trust was dissolved, any assets that 
remained and that were handed over to the Municipality when this Trust 
10 
was dissolved? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No the only thing that remained 
was the farm itself which, in terms of my estimation, valued close to 
R30million, so it was only the farm.  Remember the livestock and all the 
implements, everything was sold, so the only asset which remained and 
which was in our book, was actually the farm, totalling 4 439 as I’ve 
indicated. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes this 4 439 hectares it includes the 
town itself and the township, the Vrede Thembalihle township? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes and then what did you do then with 
this farm after the dissolution of this Trust? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   The records that I obtained from 
the Municipality, because I was not the Municipal Manager by that time, 
is that, after the dissolution of the Trust somewhere in 2011, then the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 41 of 113 
 
3 368 hectares of the 4 439 hectares was actually leased to four 
farmers.  So there were four local farmers, I must indicate Chair that 
they also four white local farmers, the information is given in terms of 
the number of hectares and everything that was leased.  So that was 
leased and the period was from October 2011 and then expiry date was 
the 30 t h of September 2013 and the annual combined rental that was 
paid by this four farmers, was R958 880 so that was the money that 
was paid to the Municipality for 3 368 but that was the annual rental 
that was paid because actually it was paid in two tranches, on tranche 
in March and then the other one in September. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was just the rent, the annual rent was just 
under R1million? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, we have heard evidence from 
Mr Radebe as well as Mr Venter regarding the lease of this farm that 
was now entered into between the Municipality and the Free State 
Province. I’m interested in the first meeting that took place on the 12 t h 
of June 2012, according to Mr Radebe, would you please just – 
according to Mr Radebe, or during this council meeting, this meeting 
was hijacked by the officials from the Department of Agriculture as well 
20 
as the MEC at the time, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane and when they came to 
request that they be given this farm, please take us through what 
transpired in that meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Okay Chair, it was exactly on the 
12 t h of June 2012, so that is exactly the date in the morning, the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 42 of 113 
 
delegation from the Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development led by Mr Thabethe then visited the Municipality.  We had 
a planned – pre-planned council meeting for that particular day, so they 
came at around 8 o’clock and then they requested to do a presentation 
to all – just before the council started that to all the councillors but 
there were also some local business people including some local 
farmers who were already been invited, I assumed that the invitation 
was then prepared by the Department.  so it was in a boardroom and all 
were there and that’s when Mr Thabethe presented, it was in a 
PowerPoint presentation that he made.  Chair if you can allow me, I’ve 
10 
given an extract of whatever was in that presentation because we never 
had the hardcopy it was just a PowerPoint presentation…[intervention]. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Sorry before you go there Mr Moremi, the 
farmers that you referred to, was it the beneficiaries, these upcoming 
small farmers at Vrede or was it other farmers? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No at that time there was no 
mention of any beneficiaries, it was just the local farmers because 
remember this was like a huge project that was going to be established 
in Vrede.  Remember Vrede or Phumelela Municipality is a very small 
rural Municipality in the Eastern Free State, very small with almost very 
20 
low revenue base so this particular project, as it was covered in the 
presentation was going to be one of the massive projects in Vrede 
which was going to create more jobs.  So obviously there were going to 
be a need for some local farmers to also supply raw milk to the dairy 
farm so that’s why they were now part of thing because it was going to 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 43 of 113 
 
benefit almost the community and the farmers by that time but there 
was no mention about the beneficiaries at that stage. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Okay, then go ahead and go to where you 
wanted to refer Chair to, is it what was recorded in the meeting on that 
day, that was on page 8 of your affidavit. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   That is – I must indicate, that is 
on my original affidavit page MM04. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   If you allow me Chair, I would like 
to read it thoroughly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes do so. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  “During the month of June 2012, 
the team from the Department of Agriculture, led by the head of 
Department…[intervention] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry I thought you were reading from page 4. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   From MM03 Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Oh from page 3 Chair, it’s the last 
paragraph 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes we just say page 3, MM is your initials. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Okay Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  “During the month of June the 
 
team from the Department of Agriculture, led by the head of 
 
Department, Mr Thabethe visited the Municipality and made a 
 
presentation about Vrede Integrated Dairy Project to municipal 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 44 of 113 
 
 
council, community and commercial farmers.  The purpose of 
 
the presentation was to create awareness about the project 
 
and to request the Municipality, I’m referring to council if I’m 
 
saying Municipality, to avail the farm, Krynaauwslust for the 
 
operation of the dairy farm production facility.  In his 
 
presentation the HOD quoted the following, the MEC for Rural 
 
Development 
and 
Agriculture 
at 
that 
time, 
honourable 
 
Mosebenzi Zwane, in his departmental budget vote for the 
 
financial year 2012/2013 resolved that a dairy and a 
 
processing plant will be established in Vrede and a specific  
10 
 
amount will then be set aside for the project.  The project will 
 
be one of the biggest in the country as the Department will be 
 
partnering with a company from India called Paras and thus 
 
attracting foreign direct investment to the province.  The 
 
project, during it’s initial phase will employ 500 permanent 
 
employees and the total investment in the property plant and 
 
machinery at the initial phase was estimated at around 
 
R500 000. 
 
The 
project 
will 
place 
Phumelela 
on 
the 
 
international map and have massive economic spin-off for the 
 
local and the neighbouring farmers, I’m referring to the 
20 
 
commercial farmer, who will provide raw milk at an attractive 
 
price”. 
 
That’s the end of background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  So that is – that is part of what Mr 
Thabethe quoted as having been said by MEC Zwane at the time during 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 45 of 113 
 
the – his budget vote? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Mr Moremi this presentation how was 
it presented to you?  Did you get any perks to consider?  How was it 
done on that day? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair let me explain that.  When a 
council meeting is convened it will depend whether it will be a special 
council meeting or an ordinary council meeting.  You will then have 
items that are submitted to the speaker and the Mayor and then the 
10 
agenda pack will then be distributed to all the councillors which was 
exactly what happened.  But unfortunately this particular item was not 
in the – in the – in the pack that was distributed to the councillors.  As I 
said the HOD just came with a delegation unfortunately it coincided 
with the date of the council and that presentation was then made.  And 
I can confirm that I cannot recall even us having received the hard copy 
to that effect.  It was just a visual power point presentation.  So what I 
have summarised here is some of the silent or the most important 
aspects that we actually covered in the presentation. But it was not 
part of the item or the pack that was given to all councillors before. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – but was it on the agenda this presentation? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  It was never on the agenda Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I will indicate. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 46 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just accommodated? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  It was just accommodated that is 
why you will see in one of the documents that when the council took 
that particular decision it was covered under Deputations and 
Interviews.  You know normally when somebody comes and he makes 
the presentation – so that is exactly how it was covered because – but 
it was not part of the – of the agenda pack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was a council meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja it was a council meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  In fact what happened is 
subsequent to the presentation those local farmers and business 
people they all left and then – then council had to then continue with its 
own business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And that particular matter was 
flagged or captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Under Deputations and Interviews.  
And there were resolution that were passed by council which were then 
20 
supporting that particular project ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – excuse me.  So it would not be correct to 
describe that meeting as a community meeting?  It was a council 
meeting to – which was attended by community members? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No Chair let me explain it like 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 47 of 113 
 
that.  There was a planned council meeting for that particular day.  
Remember Mr Thabethe and his delegation they just – because it was 
the first time that I saw them there.  So they just came in but before the 
council meeting could start that is where in the same council chamber 
that is where this presentation was made.  But those who were in 
attendance were the councillors because they were there you know for 
the council meeting. They were there, the local business people and 
the farmers so presentation was not made not in a formal council 
meeting.  It was just like everybody there and then that is why after 
that everybody left and the council continued. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it might be correct to call it a community 
meeting which took place in the council chamber? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  What bothered Mr Radebe is 
that there were certain resolutions that were taken in this meeting.  In 
fact he – according to Mr Radebe these type of requests – I will refer 
you to the relevant page.  These type of requests ought to have been 
20 
made formally.  They ought to have been given packs before the 
meeting and this matter should have been on the agenda for 
consideration because following this meeting which he describes as the 
act as that the council meeting was hijacked by the Department of 
Agriculture and the MEC you made certain resolution.  He attests this 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 48 of 113 
 
document – you also attach in your affidavit. It is on page 8 of your 
original affidavit.  Chair this was the document that was not very clear 
on Mr Radebe’s bundle.  I will swop that annexure with this one 
because this one is more clearer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think go back to what you are saying to Mr 
Moremi about what Mr Radebe said so that it is clear what you … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you want him to respond to anything or what 
you are saying. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Yes what I want you to – what I 
10 
am saying to you Mr Moremi is that Mr Radebe said this – the 
Department of Agriculture and the MEC hijacked the council meeting 
and made this presentation.  What do you say to that? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I am not going to use the word 
hijacked but as a councillor Mr Radebe was correct and as I have 
indicated that when there is a council meeting scheduled you need to 
have 
items, 
you 
need 
to 
attach 
everything 
all 
supporting 
documentations for each items and then you need to give the bundle to 
the councillors almost two days before the council meeting.  So that is 
exactly the normal operation of council but as I have indicated we were 
20 
not aware of that particular presentation that would be made when we 
are even doing the agenda.  So it just came in in the morning that is 
why the council meeting had to be a little delayed so that we could 
allow the presentation and then council to took place afterwards. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And why… 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 49 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe – maybe hijack might not be accurate 
because we do not understand that the councillors were objecting or 
protesting.  It looks like they had no problem with the Department of 
Agriculture making a presentation. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Understood Chair.  I was just following from 
Mr Radebe’s words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes.  My question to you Mr 
10 
Moremi why did you allow this to happen?  If the Department of 
Agriculture has not given you prior notice or made a formal request that 
they wanted to do this presentation to the council why did you allow 
this to happen? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Let me explain that the 
Municipality had 15 councillors.  I just want to go a little bit back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The Municipality had 15 
councillors 
and 
Councillor Radebe 
was 
a councillor 
that 
was 
representing the Democratic Alliance.  But there were three councillors 
20 
so it was him and the other two councillors.  And they were all in 
attendance at that particular meeting.  And I can confirm that all the 
councillors in actual – after having listened to the presentation 
including those two councillors of the DA were happy.  It was just a 
normal concern that Mr Radebe raised but in the end the decision was 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 50 of 113 
 
taken unanimously and it was recorded as such in the Minutes of 
Council.  As to how we have allowed the presentations to take place it 
is a bit of a difficult question but as I have indicated that it was a 
request by the Department when they were there that they must do a 
presentation and remember I was also at [intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You probably had no power to say anything. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I had no power to say no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so that is an unfair question to him. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  And could you please 
10 
then give us what was resolved in that meeting, the meeting of the 12 t h.  
It is also recorded on page 8. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The resolutions – there were three 
resolutions. 
1. Resolution 1 that council note the content of the reports on this 
item.  That the project be accepted and supported.  That the 
administration – this administration now is referring to me as an 
Accounting Officer and the team and the HOD of Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development must then draft resolutions 
that would then be adopted by council before the end of next 
20 
week.   
So it was under Deputations and Interviews and those were the 
resolutions.  But obviously then the Department was then expected to 
then draft the resolutions that will then come properly so that it then 
becomes an item of the agenda for that particular meeting that took 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 51 of 113 
 
place. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Did that happen?  Did you 
receive those resolutions? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes on the 21 June 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The HOD Peter Thabethe emailed 
those draft resolutions which were then incorporated into the agenda of 
the – the next meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the meeting of the 3 July? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The meeting of the 3 July ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us talk about what you call the resolution that 
was taken on the 12 t h about this project.  Was this resolution taken by 
the council now sitting as a council after the Department of Agriculture 
had left or was it – or was this a resolution of what may be can be 
called the community meeting, so who took that resolution?  Was it the 
council sitting in a council meeting?  Was it a resolution of those who 
were at this community meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair the resolution was taken by 
the full council.  As I said there were fourteen councillors who were in 
attendance.  After the community meeting everybody left then their 
20 
meeting started.  So it was a council decision taken during a formal 
council meeting on that particular day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now it strikes me as quite strange that the 
council should be so quick to make resolutions on something that – 
about which they have just received a presentation and no documents, 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 52 of 113 
 
nothing but they quickly make a very important resolution without it 
seems from what I have read in your statement without really much of 
any questions from them.  Without them looking at how viable this 
would be.  Without them looking at what the financial implications could 
be for the Municipality in regard to this.  Are you able to say anything 
to me?  I am just concerned that this is quite strange they do not ask 
for time to consider it, reflect on it and say we will come back to you or 
anything like that.  That seems very strange to me. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair you correct.  You correct 
because it was then resolutions that were taken based on the – the 
10 
power point presentation that was made.  And as I have indicated not 
even any councillors in that meeting even myself had a copy of that 
particular presentation.  Ordinarily as I have said there should have 
been a formal request from the Department to the Municipality either to 
me as an Accounting Officer or to the Mayor through the MEC at that 
time where there was then background given and then there will then 
be this presentation and then we will then have some other reports like 
your Feasibility Studies and everything that we had done so that then 
councillors could then apply their mind before a council meeting and go 
through that and then as a result take resolutions.  But as I have said 
20 
Chair it was resolutions taken just based on the presentation that was 
not done.  That was done by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – do you know whether any councillors may 
have been involved in previous discussions or meetings with the 
Department of Agriculture or Mr Thabethe or Mr Zwane that gave them 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 53 of 113 
 
– that may have given them enough information to be able to make this 
kind of decisions prior to this meeting?  Do you know whether they may 
have been involved in any meetings where – which would have given 
them enough information to make such a decision at this meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair I am of the view that the 
Mayor Mr Moyaung could have been aware of that particular meeting 
because people cannot just pitch in your territory and they come and 
make a presentation and there were even people that were invited 
before without that.  So I – because if you – if you – you read under the 
Deputation it says:  The speaker gave the Mayor the platform while 
10 
awaiting for the MEC to arrive to then welcome the delegation.  So my 
assumption is that there may have been some discussions prior to that 
with the Mayor but I think it will be correct if the Mayor himself can 
confirm to that.  But from that particular engagement it was not like 
something that is fairly new.  But to me it was like a surprise because 
that is the first time that I started hearing about this particular project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know that you had been in the Municipality for a 
short time a year or just over a year but do you know whether the way 
that this matter was dealt with was the way other matters were dealt 
with by the council.  Was it normal for somebody to just come, make a 
20 
presentation and a very serious decision is taken there and then 
without any proper discussions, reflection and consideration of 
implications for the council and where necessary without getting advice 
from appropriate professionals to assist the com – the council to make 
a decision.  Do you know whether this was the norm or whether this 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 54 of 113 
 
was not the norm? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair this – this cannot be the 
norm.  I think I have indicated exactly what was supposed to have 
happened.  This cannot be the norm.  There should have been more 
information provided and engagements undertaken.  Maybe after the – 
the presentation I do not – I think it was maybe too early but it was 
councillors that took a decision.  It may have been too early for 
councillors to pronounce on that particular matter based on the 
presentation.  I think ideally more information could have been properly 
sourced so that there is a proper meeting with more information so that 
10 
then council can then apply its mind.  But ja based – it was definitely 
not an ordinary way in terms of how decisions are made by council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You then deal with the resolution that 
followed after the draft resolution that you received.  Please just take 
us to what was said in this resolution?  I appears on page 14 of your 
original statement. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Page? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Page 14, 14.  I would like you to read the 
salient points to the record of that resolution?  First of all where did 
20 
you get this resolution – draft resolution from? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair this draft resolutions were 
prepared by the Department of Agriculture.  I have indicated that I 
received an email from Peter Thebethe on the 21 June where this 
particular draft attached and then I printed it out. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 55 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So it was resolutions that were 
developed and prepared by the Department of Agriculture for tabling to 
council. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Can I go through/ 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes go through this – this draft resolution 
then was then tabled on the meeting you had on the 3 July, is that 
correct? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And would you please then go through 
the salient points of this draft resolution? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The heading there says: Vrede 
Integrated Dairy Agri Business Project.  And then there is a resolution 
there of 3 July.  The resolutions allowing the Department of Agriculture 
and Estina PTY Limited/Paras Dairy Company to use the Municipality 
land to develop a dairy production facilities in Phumelela local 
municipality Free State Province.  The Department of Agriculture has 
requested that the Phumelela local Municipality adopt a resolution 
allowing for the ownership and operations of a dairy production facility 
20 
by Estina PTY Limited/Paras Dairy Company within the Municipality on 
agricultural land because doing so will promote and stimulate economic 
growth and development within the Municipality.  And whereas the 
council believe it is in the best interest of Municipality and each citizen 
that dairy production facilities be allowed to be developed in Phumelela 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 56 of 113 
 
by Estina PTY Limited/Paras Dairy Company and whereas the council 
take note that the Municipality will hold a stake of 4% shareholding in 
the business for the use of the Municipal land which will be used for 
the development of infrastructure of different forms in the Municipality.  
Now therefore be it resolved that for the purpose of this resolution the 
term Dairy Production Facility shall be defined as follows: 
Dairy Production Facility means the land, structures and related 
equipment used for the housing and breeding and raising and feeding 
or milking dairy cows.  The term includes within its meaning only such 
agricultural land as is necessary for proper disposal of liquid and solid 
10 
waste and for isolation of the facility to reasonably protect the confines 
cows from exposure to disease.  Be it further resolved that for the 
purpose of this resolution the term Agricultural land shall be defined as 
follows: 
Agricultural land means land suitable for use in farming.  Be it further 
resolved that Estina PTY Limited/Paras Dairy Company are hereby 
permitted to use the 4400 hectares of agricultural land located in 
Phumelela Municipality for use in conjunction with a dairy production 
facility.  Be it further resolved that this resolution is applicable to all 
applicable laws.  Be it further resolved that the Municipal Manager is 
20 
directed and empowered to publish this resolution and this resolution 
shall take effect 30 days after the final publication unless a valid 
petition in opposition to the same is filed in accordance with the 
Municipal by-laws.  In witness where of the above and [indistinct] going 
resolution was unanimously adopted on the 4 t h day of July 2012.  That 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 57 of 113 
 
is what this document reads. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. And what then happened to this draft 
resolution?  You tabled it on the 3 July?  Was is adopted by the 
Municipality? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  As an Accounting Officer by that 
time of the Municipality because if you – if you read there the first 
paragraph that says:  The Department of Agriculture has requested that 
the Phumelela Municipality adopt a resolution allowing for the 
ownership and operation of a dairy facility by Estina PTY Limited. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  There is a process that must be 
followed by the Municipality especially when a Municipality wants to 
have business with a private company and they call it a Public Private 
Partnership.  But in this instance there was mentioning of the word 
ownership so there is no way that a farm, a property of a Municipality 
could then just be transferred or even leased to or transferred to the 
private company Estina/Paras without that particular processes being 
followed. So in that particular meeting in my capacity as an Accounting 
Officer I then advised council not to adopt these particular resolutions?  
I think there is council resolutions that were adopted. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And on the 26 June I then 
communicated to the then Head of Department Peter Thabethe about 
the resolutions that council had taken.  A Municipality is not allowed to 
own shares in a private company so had I done that then I will have 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 58 of 113 
 
compromised the Municipality and the community by giving away such 
an important asset to a private company.  So I then advised council that 
we cannot adopt these draft resolutions as they are. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and this draft resolution is talking of 
4400 hectares.  You have told us that the farmers were renting about 
3300 I cannot remember the exact but about 3300 hectares a rough 
estimate.  What does it – where does the 4400 come from? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  As I have indicted this – ja the 
draft resolution that I received from the Department of Agriculture but 
yes indeed that was not – because remember only 3368. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Hectares of the 4439 were the 
ones that was actually being rented out by the Municipality so there 
was no way because when you talk about 4400 here it then included 
that the whole town of Vrede and Thembalihle would then be also given 
away.  So – and remember now there are some housing development 
extensions that are taking place.  Because then the moment you give 
the whole farm away I mean how will the Municipality then be able to do 
those expansions?  So the 4400 hectares – but in the letter that I wrote 
to the HOD. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  That date 26 July I did indicate to 
him that the correct hectares that may be made available for his is only 
3368 not 4400. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes is that the letter that appears on the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 59 of 113 
 
next page, page 15 dated 6 July? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And you saying that these draft 
resolutions was then not adopted by the council? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No they were not adopted by 
council. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And then what happened 
thereafter? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you referred to – you said on the 26 June you 
wrote to Mr Thebethe but I wonder whether you meant July because the 
meeting that you have been talking about was on the 3 July, is it not? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Oh correction Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja it was on the 6 July when I was 
communicating the resolution of a councillor meeting of the 3 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Chair the letter is on page 15 of the 
bundle it is dated the 6 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it.  And I was concerned about what he 
said. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 60 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not what is in the letter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you so much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Would it then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry while Ms Buthelezi is looking at that during 
the meeting of the 12 June was anything ever said why it was so urgent 
that council should make any decisions about this project?  Why was 
everything being rushed like this? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair what I can recall and that 
was also covered in the presentation is that apparently the Department 
10 
or the delegation from the Department prior to that particular meeting 
of 12 June had apparently had a visit to India on the basis of the 
agreement that was signed between the government, the Free State 
government and the government of India where this particular 
engagements and everything were done and the urgency was therefore 
– because remember there was an expectation that there will then be 
money coming from – from abroad through Paras that will be invested.  
So I think the urgency there was all about you know having this 
particular project run.  But Chair as to why there was such a pressure I 
cannot – I think that is the little that I can actually confirm ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it is quite strange I think yesterday I heard 
evidence of how the according to the … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Ms Fourie. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Fourie was Deputy Director General in the 
Department of the Provincial Treasury at the time how the CFO of the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 61 of 113 
 
Department of Agriculture was pressurising them to issue a handwritten 
cheque for R30 million and it was not clear why there was such an 
urgency.  It was a Friday afternoon and she according to Ms Fourie 
wanted that cheque now, now or latest the following morning which was 
a Saturday.  And it is not clear why there was such urgency.  So here in 
regard to this meeting on the 12 June again there is a council meeting 
scheduled with its own agenda.  People from the Department of 
Agriculture come in, they are not on the agenda from what you have 
told me.  They are allowed to come in, make a presentation. After that 
same meeting, same day the council makes very important decision to 
10 
go along with this project and it makes one wonder why – what was so 
urgent about things relating to this project?  But you have said what 
you know in terms of that meeting of the 12 t h. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Mr Moremi then on paragraph 9 
of your original affidavit you talk about the meeting that was arranged 
for the 17 July the meeting that was arranged by the Mayor Mr Motaung 
that took place at – that took place at the Municipal premises.  Could 
you please take us through that meeting?  It is on page 4 of your 
20 
original affidavit. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair if you may allow?  Let me 
just bring it in more perspective. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And on record in terms 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 62 of 113 
 
of exactly what happened.  I can still recall exactly what happened.  On 
the 17 July 2012 I – I was driving to the office it was just around before 
eight o’clock on that day.  I then received a call from the Director 
General then in the office of the Premier Ma’am Elsebe Rockman.  She 
was the Director General at that time.  What she said to me is that Mr 
Moremi I just want to make you aware that there will be a delegation 
from India who are interested in investing in Vrede that will be coming 
to have a meeting with you and the Mayor.  In the event that there is a 
need for – for you in terms of needing some legal advice because 
remember Phumelele is a very small Municipality, low revenue base. 
10 
Although it is supposed to pay for its own costs.  In the event that there 
is a need for legal advice do not go to private lawyers, pay a lot of 
money, inform me then I will make it a point that I refer this matter to 
the state law advisors.  When I say State Law Advisors I am referring to 
Mr Venter and Ms A (unclear).  So that is exactly what the - what the 
DG actually then told me to do and he has indeed.  The - the delegation 
arrived on that particular day.  It was not a big delegation. 
It was a - a gentleman by the name of Ashok Narayan.  It was 
Ashok Narayan and he was accompanied by the lawyer Mr Schalkwyk.  
So those were the two that came. I - I believe that Ashok Narayan was 
20 
the one who was actually representing the - the investors that are 
coming to partner with the - with the - with the department.  So … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So did you know this Mr Ashok Narayan?  
Was it the first time you saw him on that day? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No.  It was the first time that I saw 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 63 of 113 
 
him that day.  The same as Mr Schalkwyk.  So those were the two faces 
that I saw for the first time that date, ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes because we have had the evidence of 
Mr Venter that Mr Narayan was the advisor to the former Premier 
Mr Ace Magashule.  He was appointed in February 2012. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I was not aware of that particular 
one Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes then proceed. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see that in paragraph 9 of your statement 
10 
Mr Narayan Ashok 
or 
Ashok Narayan 
and 
Mr van 
- 
and 
Mr Johan Schalkwyk are said to have been representatives of a new 
venture called Zayna Investments (Pty) Ltd. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I - I will come to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that …?  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you talk about a local businessman. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair I am - I am trying to get hold 
20 
of this - of the agreement.  I think it is 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will help you where to find it.  If you have not 
found it. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  It is page 18.  That is the 
agreement of lease entered into between the Phumelela Local 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 64 of 113 
 
Municipality and Zayna Investments (Pty) Ltd. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  I am sorry. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you must bring the mic a little closer to you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not too close but just a little bit closer.  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That should be okay, ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  It is a - an agreement of lease 
which was prepared which the Phumelela Local Municipality and Zayna 
10 
Investments (Pty) Ltd t/a Mohuma Mobung Dairy Project.  So that was 
the agreement that the - the lawyer Mr Schalkwyk had and it was 
brought to me for me to sign it and in  that meeting then the - the Major 
Mr Motaung was there as well in that meeting … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And then a local businessman 
called Oupa Frans Mokoena.  Oupa Frans Mokoena is just a local 
businessman who was also part of the - the community when there was 
a presentation done on the 12 t h.  So he was there.  So he just - both of 
them joined the meeting but none of them said a single word because it 
20 
was me then who was engaging both Ashok and Schalkwyk … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
About 
the 
content 
of 
this 
agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who was Oupa Mokoena representing in 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 65 of 113 
 
this meeting?  What was his role in this meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  As I said he is just a local 
businessman.  So he was just there.  He was not representing anybody 
else in that meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Why was he in this meeting?  Who invited 
him? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  He just came with the Mayor.  So 
and then they both joined me but as I said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  There is little that he actually 
10 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 Ja, 
but 
he 
is - 
he 
is 
a 
businessman that - that we all know in that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  He obviously had an interest … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the topic. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then what happened?  This 
agreement came - was it came prepared by Mr Schalkwyk and 
Mr Narayan - Narayan? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  As - as I indicated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you seen it before this meeting - this agreement?  
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 66 of 113 
 
Had you seen this agreement before this meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No.  That was the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, for the first time. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  They - they brought it in hard copy 
for the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The - the intention thereof was for 
me to then sign it on behalf of the municipality so that they can then 
take back and then have the other people sign there afterwards.  So 
what I did I requested that I be given an opportunity.  Go through this 
10 
particular contract which - which they allowed and I - I did and when I 
was going through this particular agreement I think it is page 20, ja. 
That agreement spoke about the four percent shares - 
ordinary shares that will be issued to the municipality.  The municipality 
was going to be the lessee and then there was a shareholders 
agreement.  That clause I was not happy about it because it says: 
“A 
shareholders 
agreement 
to 
be 
concluded 
between the lessor and the lessee within three 
years after the effective date.” 
So I mean you cannot sign an agreement now but then you 
20 
only have a shareholders agreement after three years.  So I was - I was 
not happy with that particular clause. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I was also not happy with Clause 
3.1. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 67 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Which said: 
“This lease is for a period of 99 years commencing 
on the effective date and terminating on 99 years.” 
I have just had an experience of another 99 years that were 
cancelled in 2011.  Now here comes another 99 years.  So I was not 
happy with this particular paragraph as well … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And 3.2 which says: 
“The lessee shall have the right to renew the lease 
10 
period for a further term to be mutually agreed upon 
in writing by the lessor and the lessee prior to the 
expiry of the period referred to above.” 
I was also not happy with paragraph 4.1 which said: 
“There shall be no monthly rental payable by the 
lessee to the lessor.” 
4.2: 
“The lessor will receive shares in the lease as 
being the agreed upon rental for the period.” 
So there was no indications of rental being paid.  So there 
20 
was no way that I could - and: 
“The shares will not be transferrable.” 
So those were - those were - and then 4.5 was also a concern 
to me because it says: 
“The lessor will only be entitled for the payment of 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 68 of 113 
 
dividends in the lessee after the lease become 
profitable.” 
So this is a new entity.  It might be profitable after 10 years.  
So you cannot just be given - you will get dividends when the - when 
the entity becomes profitable.  So those are some of the concerns that I 
raised with both Narayan and Van Schalkwyk. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Van Schalkwyk - Van Schalkwyk. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well this is quite strange and quite concerning.  At 
the meeting of 12 June was the name of this entity that was now going 
to be a lessee ever mentioned? 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Not at all Chair.  That time we 
were only aware of Estina/Paras (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paras.  So on the - this is now what?  On the 17 t h? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  17 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of July.  You are in a meeting with Mr Schalkwyk who 
is a lawyer it seems for this entity - Zayna … 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Narayan, Ashok or Ashok Narayan who 
appears to represent this entity. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have never heard about them before?  I do not 
know if you heard about Narayan before (intervenes). 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No as I said 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never heard about them? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No. I have never heard about 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 69 of 113 
 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They come to you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are the accounting officer.  They already have an 
agreement that has been prepared without your involvement, without 
any discussion and they expect you to just sign and they are coming 
with the Mayor.  What is the Mayor saying in all of this? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No.  In that particular meeting 
Chair I - I did indicate to the Mayor that he must allow me as an 
accounting officer to interrogate this.  So I did not want anybody else to 
10 
say no sign it.  We will take it further.  So I said I am an accounting 
officer.  Let me apply my mind on this particular thing.  So the Mayor 
was there but I was very decisive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I am concerned also about the fact that the 
Mayor should know that you do not know anything about this entity.  
You do not know anything about an agreement that is to be signed with 
this entity and he brings somebody into a meeting where the 
expectation from this person is that you should sign and this is the kind 
of thing that I would have thought that the Major would have wanted to 
know himself and maybe he knew you are the one who just did not know 
20 
… 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But one would have thought that if he knew enough 
about this entity prior to this meeting he would have had a meeting with 
you … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 70 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To brief you and tell you what was going on. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair.  In fact the - the 
expectation was that I must sign as an accounting officer and then I 
shall not worry.  The Mayor will then take it to council.  So I said no.  It 
does not work like that.  I cannot send an agreement - the Mayor does 
not represent council.  So I cannot send an agreement.  So I am not 
going to sign it and then I made a copy. 
I said now go back with the original.  Then that is where then 
10 
I - because there was an undertaking from the Director-General that if I 
need any legal assistance I must consult with her.  Then that is where I 
said no.  I left to - to go and then at least then get an opinion on this 
particular - but even before requesting for an opinion as an accounting 
officer with those particular provisions or clauses it was straightforward 
that that agreement was not any agreement that the - that I could have 
signed on behalf of the municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this meeting the way it happened was there an 
arrangement in advance that there would be this meeting and what it 
was to deal with that you knew about or did these people just rock up 
20 
with the Mayor and said let us have a meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair let me explain like that.  
They - they came because I was just in the office - just arrived in the 
office.  They came and then just almost four/five minutes then the 
Mayor came.  So - came and then be part of the meeting.  So it is not 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 71 of 113 
 
me then who went to the Mayor and said can you come and be part of 
the meeting. 
So they came with this particular agreement then the Mayor 
joined me but absolutely I was not aware of this particular meeting.  I 
was not aware of this particular contract.  What clicked in my mind … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you had no scheduled meeting with these people? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No.  It was not a scheduled 
meeting with this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They disrupted your plan for the day. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  As I said i was lucky enough 
10 
because driving to the office i then was - got the call from the Director 
General that there is this delegation.  Besides that I had no clue 
anything about people that will be coming to my office.  I was just going 
there in my office just to go and do my job, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is - it is just concerning that the Mayor seems 
to be party to this expectation that people can just come to the 
accounting officer with an agreement with an agreement and the 
expectations that you must read it now and sign or something like this.  
Yes, anyway you asked for time and you were given time to look at it 
but even that I mean I would have said you people go away. 
20 
If you have any request that I consider this we will arrange 
another meeting.  Leave the - leave the agreement.  I would have sent 
them away. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But you did not sign this - this agreement 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 72 of 113 
 
Mr Moremi? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No, no I did not sign it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Tell us about the events that followed.  
In your supplementary affidavit/statement you talk about the emails that 
you received from Mr Narayan and Mr Schalkwyk.  It appears on 
paragraph 9 of your supplementary statement.  It is on page 3.  I am 
sorry Chair.  They have - they have numbered it starting from number 
one.  So it is on page 3 of the supplementary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Okay.  Alright.  Ja, as and when I 
10 
was raising my concerns on some of the clauses or this particular 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time did you get to go through it more or 
less? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair that was just a quick … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just a quick look. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  A quick ja.  That is why I was just 
going - I did not go through this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So I just quickly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You picked up concerns. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  But as and when I am picking up 
those concerns I - I was raising them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  They were sitting in front of you as you were …? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  They were sitting in front of me, 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 73 of 113 
 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And as I was raising them 
Mr Narayan, Ashok … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Was actually making notes of 
those issues that I was raising.  So he was actually making note.  After 
the meeting he said no it is fine.  I will go back and discuss the 
concerns that we have on this agreement with the stakeholders.  I did 
10 
not know who the stakeholders were but then on 18 July the following 
day I then received an email from Mr Ashok. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  That email will appear on page 37 in 
the middle of that page.  It is the one that is printed in black 
Chairperson. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Page? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  37.  It is just the back of this document.  It 
is right at the back.  Behind - behind the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Buthelezi. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Oh, oh yes.  Okay.  Sorry, sorry 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Chair.  I am misleading the witness.

Page 74 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think if you say the page number that should 
suffice. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair if you allow.  Can I - can I 
read this particular email for the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
It 
was 
an 
email 
from 
10 
Ashok Narayan.  I received it on 18 July 02:14 I think.  14 minutes past 
two in the afternoon and it reads as follows: 
“Dear Sir …” 
It was addressed to me and then Mr Johan was copied there.  
I do not know is this Walemsa (?).  There was another person that was 
also copied there in this particular email and it says: 
“Clarifications on lease agreement issues.” 
He says: 
“Many thanks to yourself and the Mayor for the time 
spent with us to discuss the proposed lease 
20 
agreement.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I thought Ms Buthelezi said page 37. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Page 37 of the supplementary 
affidavit/statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well are there two pages 37? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 75 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes there is one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the whole pack? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There is one from the original statement.  
They then paginated the supplementary statement from page 1.  Maybe 
they should have continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You see this is going to cause confusion. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did they - if it was going to be in the same file 
why did they have to start a new numbering? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I am sorry Chair.  We received this this 
10 
morning it was very late for us even to rectify it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the problem is that once we … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once the witness deals with it on the basis of a 
certain numbering if you change it later … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will not - it will not accord when one reads the 
transcript. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair if I may just take five minutes.  I can 
do it by hand just to avoid confusion … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And continue because it is not a lot of 
pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thanks. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 76 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us rather do - do that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Moremi.  This needs to be sorted out so 
that we do not have problems. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn for five minutes.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so what’s the page number? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, we are indebted Chairperson, 
it’s on page 98 that is written in black now, the fourth last page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’ve got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think he must start afresh about identifying the 
email now that it’s – we know which page it is on. 
ADV LAHR GCABASHE SC:  Thank you, Mr Moremi there is the email 
you received from Mr Narayan, (name spelt) you got this email on the 
18 t h of July at 2h14PM, is that correct? 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes and you wanted to read this email to 
the record? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Please go ahead.

MR 
TEKOETSILE 
MOSES 
MOREMI: 
 
 
The 
subject 
there 
is, 
“clarifications on lease agreement issues”, then it reads as follows, 
 
“Dear sir, many thanks to yourself and the Mayor for the time 
 
spent with us to discuss the proposed lease agreement 
 
yesterday.  A few points that were brought to the table 
 
yesterday and which I would like to clarify after having  
 
discussed with the stakeholders  
 
1). the shares being issued to all shareholders, including the 
 
Municipality entity will be ordinary shares and not preference 
 
shares. 
10 
 
2). The shares will be held in a Trust by the shareholders of 
 
(indistinct) of the Municipality till such time as the Municipal 
 
entity is formed. 
 
3). The four percent was calculated based on the available 
 
shares after allocations to the BEE beneficiaries and was not 
 
based on any commercial value. 
 
4). On the rates and taxes this should be paid for by the 
 
Municipality as the owner of the property.  The Municipality is 
 
getting a four percent stake in the business in lieu of rentals. 
 
5). The lease is being contemplated as a rent-free lease. 
20 
 
6). The term of the lease should be 99 years. 
 
7). If possible the Municipality should try and relocate the 
 
exiting tenants instead of transferring the lease to Zana 
 
Investments. 
 
Regards, Ashok. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 78 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, upon receiving this email, what then 
did you do? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   My reply is on page number – it 
starts from page 97. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go to your reply, just to go back to the 
meeting of the 12 t h as well as the meeting of the 3 r d of July – 12 t h of 
June and 3 r d of July.  So the council was making the decisions that it 
was making on the 12 t h of June and on the 3 r d of July in circumstances 
where there were leases in existence affecting the same farm, relating 
10 
to, I think, did you say, four farmers or were those leases no longer 
there? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Those leases were still in 
existence, let me just get my mind correctly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   The – I know that there was 
engagement – ja no because that was in 2013 the engagement with the 
farmers ja.  On the 12 t h of June and the 9 t h of July council took that 
decisions while the farm was still being leased to the four farmers 
because the contract of the four farmers was expiring on the 30 t h of 
20 
September 2013 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so they made – they rushed to make all these 
decisions in circumstances where, actually even if they wanted to go 
along with the project they would have had to first sort out issues with 
the existing tenants? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 79 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was never discussed at the meeting – at the 
two meetings as to how can we make these decisions before we sort 
issues out with the existing tenants, that was – or was it discussed? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair, if I’m correct, in the letter 
that I addressed to Mr Thabethe on the 26 t h and 3 r d of July -  I just 
want to check where those letters are here. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   The letter for the – you address on the 26 t h 
of June, it should be on page 9. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Of the original? 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes of – in fact we only have one page 9 
now, page 9. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair, I wrote that letter 
because I was communicating the status quo at that time and Chair if 
you may allow I can quickly read it for record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you don’t need to read the whole letter, you can 
just make the point or read a particular portion that relates to the point 
you want to make and remember that, my question relates to what the 
position was as at the 12 t h of June 2012 as well as at the – I think you 
said 3 r d of July that meeting whether, in those meetings anybody said, 
20 
but how can we  make these decisions as council when there are 
tenants and we haven’t talked to them as to what we are going to do 
because we have obligations in terms of the leases with those tenants. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, maybe you should start where, on the 
third paragraph you said, “I must indicate that this farm”. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 80 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair I said, 
 
“I must indicate that this farm, exactly what you are saying 
 
Chair, I must indicate that this farm is currently leased to the 
 
following local farmers and the lease agreements commenced 
 
on the 1 s t of October 2011 and expires on the 30 t h of 
 
September”. 
 
Then I’ve mentioned those four farmers, here I was indicating 
that while we are in this process, let it be noted that there is still an 
existing agreement with the farmers and the Municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I understand what you are saying on the 26 t h of 
10 
July, I’m asking whether somebody at the council meeting of the 12 t h of 
June or that of the 3 r d of July, ever said, how can we make these 
resolutions of making this farm available to somebody else when, at the 
moment we have tenants on the farm and we have obligations. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair as far as I know that was 
not done because if that was done, then it would have been captured in 
the resolution of the meeting of the 12 t h of June, so it was not there so 
nothing was actually mentioned that time that there is actually farmers 
who are in this particular farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And as I understand the position, certainly at the 
20 
meeting of the 12 t h, it was mentioned that there were tenants on the 
farm, somebody, whoever mentioned that, so all the councillors were 
aware of it or were they not? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   They were aware Chair correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That there were tenants? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 81 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they go ahead and make these decisions with no 
regard to how this would be done at a practical level and whether it 
would be legal? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   You’re correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I go back to the question, what was the rush? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No you’re correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  The upon receiving this email 
fro Mr Narayan on the 18 t h of July, what did you do? 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   The same date, on the 18 t h of 
July, it was around eighteen minutes past four, roughly an hour and a 
half, just after I had received his email 3h03PM, 18 July, I said, 
 
“Hello Ashok, that’s from page 97 to page 98, hello Ashok I 
 
take note of your feedback from the stakeholders summarised 
 
below. I also want to inform you that I have requested the 
 
State Law Advisors and National Treasury to give us opinions 
 
on both, legal and compliance aspect of the proposed lease 
 
agreement.  I have copied both the National Treasury and the 
 
State Law Advisor representative to take note of clarity 
20 
 
provided below by the stakeholders, and I’m sure they will take 
 
that into cognisance while formulating a formal advice to 
 
Phumelela”. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes I could see that on the very same day 
you also copied Ms Rockman. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 82 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Tell me, Ms Rockman was this the first time 
that you had communicated with her with regards to a particular project 
or was it someone that you normally spoke to with? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   As I’ve said, my conversation with 
Ms Rockman was specifically on that date of the 17 t h of July when she 
then informed me that there’ll be this delegation coming.  So the emails 
and everything which was sending to the State Law Advisors I was 
copying her as well because in the same page 97, even though she did 
not reply, she replied – oh it was on the 18 t h as well. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes but late in the afternoon. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes late in the afternoon she 
said, 
 
“Just got back from Thabantsho where were doing some work 
 
at [indistinct] intermediary schools for Mandela Day, I 
 
personally doubt whether you’ll be able to justify a rent-free 99 
 
year lease agreement and be responsible for…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry where are you reading from now? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Page 97. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Page 97 on top. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Still 97 okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:    
“I personally doubt whether you’ll  be able to justify a rent-free 
99 year lease agreement and be  responsible for payments of 
rates and taxes.  While the Municipality is allocated four 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 83 of 113 
 
percent shares, which is not based on commercial value while 
at the same time losing a guaranteed income from the current 
lease agreement.  Let’s see what National Treasury and the 
State Law Advisors advise”. 
So that’s her response in what Mr Narayan has covered in the email 
below. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As at this – as at the 17 t h of July when you got this 
delegation that rocked up at your office without any prior arrangement 
and you heard for the first time about this entity, Zana, did you assume 
that this Zana represented Paras or was a Paras entity or did you say 
10 
where does Zana come in here now, we’ve been told of Estina and 
Paras, what’s going on? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair I must be honest, I did not 
answer that but you are correct that from the 12 t h of June, because that 
was a month after, we were all talking about Estina and Paras so as to 
how then the new entity was then established, because if you read the 
agreement it says, Zana Investment trading as Mahoma-Mobung, so as 
to how that…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes two names you know nothing about? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Two names I know nothing about 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the Mayor also, on the 12 t h of – on the 17 t h of 
July doesn’t say – tell you anything about the connection between – if 
there’s any between this Zana and Estina and Paras? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No he said nothing Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 84 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and up to now nobody had explained that 
connection as at the date of this email, 18 July 2012? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No nothing Chair, except the fact 
that as time goes on that’s where then Estina came afterwards, so I 
don’t know exactly what happened to the disappearance of Zana, but 
subsequent to that then it was then Estina Dairy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but basically on the agreement that was 
presented to you for signature by Mr Narayan and Mr Schalkwyk they 
wanted you to make the land available to them for 99 years. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   They didn’t want to pay any rent? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They wanted the Municipality to pay the taxes and 
rates? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They called that a lease, a lease without rent? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’ve never heard of anything like that and they 
basically wanted to use this land for free for 99 years and even with 
regard to the four percent shares, they were saying, you know, the 
20 
Municipality will get them when – dividends when there is profit, 
wherever that is, whenever that will be, that’s what they presented to 
you? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   You’re correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course you picked up all of these things? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 85 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you didn’t say in regard to the meeting on the 
17 t h is, what was the attitude of the Mayor himself, when you raised 
these concerns, did he – did he get surprised that this is what was 
being presented to you, did it look like he was not surprised, he knew, 
he had looked at the lease, he knew about this, there was no problem 
as far as he was concerned or is the position that you couldn’t tell what 
his reaction was? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   At that time Chair I was sitting 
like this and Mr Narayan and Schalkwyk were like facing me there, the 
10 
Mayor was just next – but remember as I said, I indicated it in the 
beginning that, Mayor may you please allow me to engage the contract 
and then also present, so I did not expect even anybody else who can 
say do this because that was a very serious decision that I were to 
take, so I had to apply my mind thoroughly so he was sitting next to 
me.  Unfortunately, I didn’t look in terms of exactly the face 
whatever…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You couldn’t see ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes but he was part of that 
meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did he – after the meeting or at any time over the 
next few days, talk to you and say – say anything like, I was shocked 
that these people – this is what these people want to do or anything 
like that? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No, what he said Chair, is that, 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 86 of 113 
 
he actually appreciate the braveness that I displayed and the fact that I 
refused to sign the agreements but then giving reasons why, so that’s 
what we discussed afterwards ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he expressed appreciation. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes expressed appreciation for 
my braveness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, before the – I wanted to 
understand your communication with Ms Rockman before the 17 t h of 
July 2012, have you ever had any form of communication with Ms 
10 
Rockman? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Not at all Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   So this was your first time you spoke with 
her? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes that call that he made in the 
morning, that was the first time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  Then – let’s then move to 
whether the advice that you got from the State Law Advisors, just 
summarise, you don’t have to read it, the whole of it, because Mr 
Venter has already dealt with it, it appears on page 39. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you can just say the gist of the advice was, A, B, 
C, D. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Ja I think in a nutshell the advice 
from the State Law Advisors, they were actually in agreement with me 
that the issues that I raised, those clauses in the agreement were 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 87 of 113 
 
correct but then they went further and [inaudible – mic turned off], 
specific provisions in the legislations, specifically that talks about the 
Systems Act that talks about if there was going to be an agreement, the 
process that must be followed.  So in a nutshell, they actually agreed 
with my thinking and reasoning and it was on that basis that they 
advised me not to sign that particular agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, in that you couldn’t – as a 
Municipality you were not allowed to hold shares with – on a private 
company? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, and following the advice that 
you received, you deal with – the advice that you received from Mr 
Venter, after he had a meeting with MEC Zwane and the HOD on the 1 s t 
of August 2012, please take us through that advice, you also don’t need 
to read the whole thing but what you understood that advice to be 
saying. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Chair from what I’ve observed 
then it appears that immediately after I had received that legal opinion 
from Advocate Ditira on the 23 r d of July there were then some 
engagements now between the Department and Mr Venter who was 
20 
actually more senior at that particular time and it then culminated into 
what then he had to tick and amplify some of the conditions or some of 
the clauses in the legal opinion of Advocate Ditira and I must mention 
that subsequent to that particular legal opinion of Mr Venter there was 
then a proper, so to say, lease agreement that was entered into 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 88 of 113 
 
between the Municipality and the Department that is the agreement that 
was also prepared with the assistance of the State Law Advisors and 
what I did, I then took all these two legal opinions plus that particular 
agreement to council so that then council can then give me a fresh 
mandate and allow me to sign this particular agreement and there was 
a resolution to that particular effect.  That agreement was basically in 
the best interest of the Municipality because it was very clear that the 
Department is taking over the existing agreements of these four 
farmers and they are now making an undertaking that they will then pay 
whatever that I was getting from those particular farmers and what was 
10 
supposed to happen is, subsequent to the 30 t h of September 2013, we 
were then supposed to have then entered into another agreement with 
the Department for a particular period to be determined and the rental 
thereof because the Department was saying every year there will then 
be some escalation so at least there’s more benefit to the Municipality 
but I must indicate that we never had any agreement or addendum that 
extended that particular period except the contract that, at a later stage 
I will refer to, which was signed on the 12 t h of December 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes so the agreement that you signed, is 
the one that is appearing on page 47, it was the agreement between the 
20 
Free State Provincial Government and the Municipality? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, and in terms of that agreement you 
then – you had one year lease – you were leasing the land for a year to 
the Municipality – sorry to the Provincial Government? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 89 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   That agreement, when I signed it, 
it was on the 12 t h of September 2012 so remember there was already 
an existing agreement with the farmers which started from the 1 s t of 
October 2011, so what it says, it was just that the Department is then 
taking over that particular – because what happened Chair, which I 
must also indicate is that,  there was an engagement with the four 
farmers subsequently where then – and the Department of Agriculture 
was the one that determined – was then leading that particular 
delegation where then the farmers were then requested, because of the 
urgency of this particular project and say, we cannot allow the contract 
10 
to continue up until the 30 t h of September because we need to establish 
this particular agreement.  So the farmers were then, after those 
engagements, they had to then bring back the 30 t h of September to the 
end of February but because they had already occurred costs on the 
land and all these things…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, take it to February the following year? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   2013, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Because there were already costs 
that they had incurred there was then an agreement that the 
20 
Department of Agriculture would then reimburse them over and above 
paying the Municipality R1million ja.  So that contract which I signed on 
the 12 t h was only for a year up until 30 t h of September 2013. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes were you paid by the Provincial 
Government? 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 90 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No I – we did not get payment, 
remember as I said that the payment from the farmers were paid twice 
a year which was March and September.  We did not get the money 
from the Department by then, there was a letter that I wrote to the HOD 
of Agriculture, I think it was around the 15 t h of March wherein I 
reminded him that remember we’ve signed an agreement you’ve 
undertaken to pay the Municipality but I said…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now 2013? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   2013 – March 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay for 2012, the four farmers continued to pay and 
10 
paid for the whole year? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair, up until end of 
February. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of 2012? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   2013. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh 
2013, 
so 
for 
2012, 
the 
farmers 
paid…[intervention]. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  no for 2012 they had already paid 
in full ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright and then the Department had to start 
20 
paying in March of 2013? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   But that never happened, there 
was no payment that was made. I had a number of engagements 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 91 of 113 
 
because Chair I later then became the Chief Financial Officer and then 
there was another new Municipal Manager who was appointed but there 
was also a letter that I prepared myself as the CFO dated 9 September 
2013 which was signed by this new MM where I also indicated to the 
HOD that, it is now September which is almost the end of the contract 
and we have not yet received the payment and then I attached the 
invoice that…[intervention]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s get the dates first right of when you ceased to 
be with the Municipality and you joined Treasury. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I – well I was still in the 
10 
Municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, did you change hats? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I changed hats, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   From a Municipal Manager to a 
CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I think that was around July 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that an upward, sideways, or downwards 
movement? 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No I demoted myself, I requested 
to be demoted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Then that letter of the 9 t h 
September was then signed by the new Municipal Manager and that was 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 92 of 113 
 
also a reminder to the Department that, they still have not yet paid. I 
then left but through my engagements with the now current Municipal 
Manager, it appears that there was a payment that was done but I don’t 
have records, it may have been done subsequent to me joining 
Treasury but they indicated that there was a payment that was done by 
the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – but by the time you left the Municipality to your 
knowledge, no payment had been made? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Moremi, you left the 
Municipality in February 2014, is that correct? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, were you aware of the Province’s 
intention to – I don’t want to say expropriate but to transfer this land 
from Municipality to the Provincial Government? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   No Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Did you, at any stage learn about this 
transfer? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I think, if correct Chair, we’ll then 
20 
have to go to that particular agreement that I signed on the 12 t h of 
December 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   I will then give clarity on the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 93 of 113 
 
questions that you are asking. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes you do make reference to that 
agreement on your supplementary statement, please take us to how it 
came about that you signed that agreement. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is the agreement first? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   It is attached as page 66. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, yes how did that come about? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  Chair I must - I must indicate 
because this was also covered by Advocate Venter. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
It 
was 
around 
the 
- 
12 December 2013 when I then received the agreement from the - from 
the HOD Thabethe.  That must then be signed because remember at 
that stage I indicated that this agreement is important.  The department 
had already incurred costs and then we had to at least sign this 
agreement to at least protect the interest of the - of the department. 
I then read the same agreement and I had specific concerns 
on some of the clauses of that particular agreement.  Even though it 
was an agreement between the municipality and the province. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So I then sent that particular 
agreement again to Tata Venter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes but you sent it after you signed it? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No before I signed it. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 94 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Before I signed it because you will 
see his letter.  He indicated that I received - he received it on the 12 t h. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I only signed on the 14 t h. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So he then replied and indicated 
that this particular contract is in contravention with the one that I had 
already signed which was the one up until 30 September.  I think his 
opinion is - is attached somewhere else there. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  His opinion is attached and it is also - 
it was also attached to his affidavit.  In brief he said this - this 
agreement did not comply with what was resolved in the council.  Yes.  
Tell us then what happened to this agreement after you received it. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  (Intervenes). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  That particular feedback was also 
provided to the - to the Government by myself because at that time I 
had regular telephone engagements with Tata Thabethe … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  But then he said this agreement is 
very much important because remember if you read the clauses of this 
agreement it is where the municipality is ceding its right and titles to 
the department of - to the Provincial Government actually through the 
department. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 95 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So then I had an engagement with 
him and he said Mr Moremi this contract is so key and you must sign it 
and I said but I - I cannot sign a contract that did not serve before 
council and then he indicated that no, no, no we have already spoken 
to the - to the Mayor. 
He does not have a problem and he will then give that 
particular consent for you to sign it and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the Mayor is not council. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  I - I indicated that Chair that 
10 
the Mayor is not council … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  But they said - in fact I said if that 
is the case can we then have an undertaking by the Mayor with that 
particular commitment before I sign the agreement and I must indicate 
Chair that in page 72 … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The - the - maybe I must read the 
last part of that particular … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Consent Chair.  It says: 
“It is on that background that I, T J Motaung, Mayor 
of Phumelela do take note and accedes to the 
contents of the extract above and hereby authorise 
Mr T M Moremi, Municipal Manager of Phumelela to 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 96 of 113 
 
sign the Land Use Agreement and its related 
documents thereto on behalf of council.  The 
granting of permission or authority to the Municipal 
Manager to sign the Land Use Agreement will be 
presented by me in the next council meeting for 
ratification.” 
Chair I - I - as - as you have alluded the Mayor is not 
representing council and in fact I had some discussion with him prior to 
him where I made him aware that there is a consent letter that he must 
sign.  That he must take note that he is not council.  Expecting that if - 
10 
if he then refuses then at least I will be covered but you will see the 
date there it was signed.  It was signed on 13 December … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
And 
it 
was 
only 
then 
on 
14 December that I then signed that agreement with Tata Thabethe who 
was then representing the - the Department of Agriculture. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Could …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And again this time were you told what was so urgent 
about this? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair the only thing that I was told 
20 
there because we had this agreement and everything.  Especially for 
the mere fact that the State Law Advisors also said this contract must 
not be signed but it was when Tata Venter said if you do not sign this 
agreement we are now on the verge where the investors will not be able 
to - remember there was a commitment that Estina will bring in money. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 97 of 113 
 
So if you do not sign this agreement we are now facing a 
possibility where the investors may not come and invest and that will 
then have almost fail the whole project and the municipality - the 
department by that time had incurred costs.  So that was the - the 
motivation or the rationale behind that particular agreement Chair but I 
- I signed it on that particular basis but I will come to what 
subsequently happened … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair.  I - I was not aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  So you said it was - Venter who said 
the investors will withdraw?  It is Venter or Thabethe?  Just correct 
that. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No, no.  It was - it was the HOD, 
Thabethe. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  About the urgency of us sending 
this contract and the consequences of it not being signed by then 
because then it would have then failed the whole the whole project at 
20 
all, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But again you just told about this but you are not 
given an indication that this was - this was the deadline.  We are now 
closed to a deadline or what the deadline is.  You are just told it is 
urgent.  If you do not sign now the investors might pull out but you do 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 98 of 113 
 
not know where - where was the planning for all of this thing? 
Why are these things always brought at a time when you are 
supposed to have no time to reflect properly and you are supposed to 
just sign? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair but as - as an 
accounting officer I was very much cautious that I do not just sign 
without - without - even though … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Reflect ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Without the proper processes but 
yes that was exactly what was communicated to me that this contract is 
10 
- is urgent. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What then have you since learned that 
followed you signing this contract? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Oh yes Chair.  As I said I was not 
aware that subsequent to me signing this agreement at the end the 
farm will then be transferred to the Provincial Government and as a 
result the department and Estina entering into a 99 year lease 
agreement. 
It was during that time where the Mail & Guardian were - I 
was - I was at Treasury between 2014/2015. … 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Where the Mail & Guardian had 
indicated that the municipality has actually transferred the land free of 
charge to Estina.  So that is exactly how it was reported and I mean by 
that time I was the accounting officer.  There was no way that I could 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 99 of 113 
 
just allow that particular - it was - it was a - a negative image.  So then 
I took it upon myself even though I was not at the municipal and say 
no. 
Let me rather go to the Deeds Office and go and ascertain 
the ownership of this particular farm and it was only then Chair page 74 
- no from page 73. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  These are the - the documents 
that I received from the - the Deeds Office but you will note there Chair 
that in page 74 that document says (indistinct) lease.  In page 75 Chair 
10 
what - what - when I was reading this particular document - in page 75 
you will see there Preamble A that the whole farm 44395122 were then 
subjected to this Notarial Deed. 
So it was not 3368 that - that I have spoken about and Chair 
the reason why I said I only learned that this agreement that I signed 
may have played a role here.  It was in B where it - it says if I read it.  
It says: 
“And whereas the Phumelela Local Municipality and 
the Free State Provincial Government through its 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 
20 
entered 
into 
an 
agreement 
of 
cession 
and 
assignment dated 14 September 2012 and signed at 
Bloemfontein in terms whereof all the Phumelela 
Local 
Municipalities 
rights, 
title, 
interest 
and 
obligation in the lease premises were ceded and 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 100 of 113 
 
assigned to the Free State Provincial Government 
through its Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development.” 
So that is exactly why I said no but this particular clause is 
actually in relation to that particular agreement and in - in a nutshell 
Chair what happened is if - if you read the - the agreement.  I think if I 
may just emphasise important paragraphs is the paragraph 3 page 77. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And Chair - Chair I must just refer 
you back to - remember that Zayna Investments agreement that I was 
10 
expected to sign which also had this 99 years.  So when I was reading 
this Notarial Deed that was registered on … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  18 December. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
Is 
it 
January 2013? 
 
Ja, 
somewhere. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  (Indistinct). 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  On the - on 18 January 2013 that 
is when this Notarial Deed was then registered by whoever lawyers that 
was acting on behalf of the department then … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And then Clause 3 which is 3.1. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  It reads as follows: 
“This lease is for a period of 99 years commencing 
on the effective date and terminating 99 years 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 101 of 113 
 
later.” 
3.2: 
“The lease shall have the right to renew the lease 
period or the less …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lessee. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  “The lessee shall have 
the right to renew the lease period for a further 
term of 99 years to be mutually agreed upon in 
writing by the lessor and the lessee six months 
prior to the expiry of the period referred to in 
10 
Clause 3.1.” 
The lessee and the lessor Chair is actually the Department of 
Agriculture and Estina. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the two of them? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  If - if you check the page 77 
the same page 77 just above.  It says 1.7.1.  It - it says: 
“The lessor, the Free State Provincial Government 
through its Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development and the lessee was Estina (Pty) Ltd.” 
20 
So in this particular case the less - the lessee and the lessor 
was between the Department of Agriculture and I must indicate that at 
that particular time I was absolutely not even aware of this particular 
agreement.  That now the department has now then entered into a 99 
year lease agreement with Estina which is the same thing that I was 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 102 of 113 
 
actually disputing on that agreement of Zayna Investment that I signed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so but you - you signed an agreement with the 
Provincial Government as the municipality.  Is that right? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I signed the agreement with the 
Department of Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  In my capacity as the Municipal 
Manager … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And Tata Thabethe as the HOD for 
the Department of Agriculture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ceding the municipalities rights to the Department of 
Agriculture? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then subsequently the Department of Agriculture 
leased the - the same - same farm to Estina? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair in fact in this - in this document it is 
not just the farm.  It is the entire field. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the entire - entire land. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Including the township and the town of 
Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The entire town. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair.  Correct Chair. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 103 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I could see it is now 1 o’ clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I just want to check if there is anything that 
I have left (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - ja, just check.  I would like us to finish with the 
witness so we can - we do not have to come back after lunch. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  So Mr Moremi but the - the 
advice that you have gotten from the State Law Advisors was that you 
should not sign that agreement.  You signed it based on the consent 
10 
that you received from the Municipal Manager Mr Motaung? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  From the Mayor, Mr Motaung. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Mayor. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry the Mayor, Mr Motaung. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair.  As per the - as per 
the - the letter that is attached here. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also because of what Tata Thabethe said to you.  
Namely that if you did not sign the investors were about - would pull 
out. 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were the two things that made you sign? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair; but Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Huh-uh. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Maybe in closing because when - 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 104 of 113 
 
when … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what - what did you - why did you not say to 
Tata Thabethe and Mr Motaung but the State Law Advisors say it will be 
wrong to sign this thing? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  No, no, no.  That was evident 
because remember Chair when the State Law Advisor gave that 
particular opinion normally what he does he was sending it to both the 
department and the municipality.  So even the Mayor was - was aware 
of that and that is why I said when - when I called him and made him 
aware of these things. 
10 
I was just you know - you know cautioning him that be careful 
when you - when you send that particular thing but yes the department 
and the - the Mayor were both aware of the - the legal opinion from 
Tata Venter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So all three of you Tata Thabethe, yourself and the 
Mayor were aware that if you signed this agreement that would be 
against the advice of the State Law Advisors? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I must - I must confirm Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  And say it is correct, ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you all decided it should be done? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Huh-uh. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair perhaps what I can … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 105 of 113 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  What I can indicate in terms of 
what it is that I have done subsequent to that.  I - I brought this 
particular matter.  By that time I was at Provincial Treasury and by that 
time the - the former Director-General Elzabe was now the - the MEC 
for Finance in Treasury. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Ms Rockman. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ms Rockman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Because I had a copy of this … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and she had raised some issues with the - with 
one of the agreements when you were still at the municipality? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  She raised an issue on that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Zayna Agreement that spoke … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  About a 99 year lease. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  So by that time I was in the 
department.  So I actually gave - I cannot recall when but it was during 
2012/2013.  I then gave her that copy and said let me see.  I was not 
aware but going to the Deeds Office I have now realised that there is a 
99 year agreement between the department and - and Estina and then 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 106 of 113 
 
subsequent to that there were then engagements again with the State 
Law Advisor and Tata Venter and then that then culminated into the 
cancellation. 
Remember when the - when the department terminated its 
agreement with Estina around 2014 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Subsequent to that this 99 year 
lease agreement was - was cancelled and - and I have attached 
evidence to that effect.  The only thing now that has not yet been done 
but it is in progress and was confirmed by Tata Venter is that the 
10 
process where now the - the land is now in a process of being 
transferred back to the municipality from the Provincial Government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is - it is also important to try and establish - it 
is important for this Commission to try and establish what it is that 
would drive people to doing something that maybe they know is 
contrary to the law but nevertheless they do it.  You know.  I mean you 
- you indicated earlier on what the Mayor said to you after you had 
20 
refused to sign that agreement of the 17 t h … 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of July.  He appreciated that you raise issues and 
you refuse to sign.  That suggest that on the face of it he seems to 
have appreciated that you were right to refuse. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 107 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But here is now a situation where the State Law 
Advisors say you should not sign this agreement.  It is - it is contrary.  
It is unlawful and nevertheless you who had refused to sign the - the 
agreement of 17 July.  The Mayor who had - who expressed support for 
your stance on that - subsequently on that issue takes the position that 
okay we must sign. 
I do not know if you want to talk about that a little bit or you 
just want to simply say look it is what Tata Thabethe said about the 
investors and - and you thought that is - that is enough to justify going 
10 
against doing something that may have been unlawful. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Yes Chair but acknowledging the 
fact that the agreement was signed against the - the advice by the - by 
Tata Venter.  It did not sit very well with me Chair but as I said you 
know the urgency and the - the investment that was going to be lost 
then but Chair remember at that time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He agreed with you? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Ja.  At that time I was not of the 
view that the same agreement is now going to be used for the 99 year 
Notarial Lease but - but what I did Chair it is - it is in one of my 
20 
correspondences of 15 March which I wrote to Tata Thabethe because if 
you read the - the opinion of Tata Venter he was actually indicating that 
but this Land Use Agreement does not have a period of the cession and 
then it does not have an amount. 
So what I did in a letter that I addressed to Tata Venter on 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 108 of 113 
 
the 5 t h - Tata Thabethe Chair sorry.  I will just raise the last paragraph 
where I said: 
“During December 2012 the department entered into 
a Land Use Agreement with the municipality wherein 
the rights and obligation of the municipality on the 
farm were ceded to the department.  The Land Use 
Agreement was very silent on the period of the 
cession then assignment and does not provide for 
any future compensation to the municipality in 
respect of the use of its farm property (indistinct).  
10 
It is on that basis that the department through the 
office …” 
That was my request. 
“…the department through the office of the State 
Law Advisor must develop and addendum to the 
Land Use Agreement wherein the compensation and 
the period of the cession and assignment is clearly 
spelt out.” 
So that is exactly what I did further to (indistinct).  This is 
what I have said but let me also then bring it that we - we need to 
20 
correct this thing by having addendum but I must indicate that that 
addendum - addendum was never concluded Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I get the impression from what you have said that 
your - your attitude is yes I know that we went against the advice of the 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 109 of 113 
 
State Law Advisors.  These are the circumstances in which this 
happened.  This is what was said and I did not feel good about it but it 
did happen and I am not running away from the fact that I - I was party 
to it.  Is that right? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  If I read this cession agreement 
that you signed with Mr Thabethe it is between - supposed to be 
between the municipality and the province.  Why did you sign it with 
Mr Thabethe instead of the Premier? 
10 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair remember that in the - the 
correspondence that I also had which I was privy to because I was 
interacting more often with the State Law Advisors.  There was a time 
where the State Law Advisor provided a legal advice to the - to the then 
Premier then in terms of the Land Administration Act of whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the assignment of (intervenes). 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Where now then the - the Premier 
then delegated the signing off agreement to the MEC then Tata Zwane 
20 
and subsequently then Tata Zwane further delegated it to the- to the 
HOD.  So I was well aware that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  There is an existing delegation. 
So I did not have any doubt of Mr Thabethe’s signing on behalf of … 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 110 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI: 
 
The 
Government 
or 
the 
department, ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BTHELEZI:  Thank you.  So it was based on that 
delegation of authority? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  It was based on that delegation of 
authority Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Thanks. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then lastly on the meeting of 12 June 
10 
did MEC - the then MEC Zwane attend this meeting? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair I must be honest.  When the 
presentation was done by Mr Thabethe MEC Zwane was not there.  You 
will also note it in the minutes of that particular meeting that … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  The speaker had indicated that if 
the MEC arrives in the council meeting then the Mayor will have to then 
you know acknowledge his presence … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  But he was not part of the - of the 
20 
presentation.  I think he may have joined the council but that particular 
time but I do not have a good recollection to that one but I must 
confirm that he was not part of the - of the presentation.  It was done 
by Tata Thabethe … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 111 of 113 
 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Who was accompanied by the 
delegation of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Chair, sorry.  The municipality 
was it involved in the appointment of beneficiaries? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Chair I - I must indicate that when 
that particular process of the identification and what, what of the 
beneficiaries started I was not part thereof.  Remember I had then 
leased the farm to - to the department.  So whatever that the 
department did subsequent to that particular one. 
I was not part thereof.  So I was not part of the identifications 
10 
of the beneficiaries and all these things.  So I was - I was not party to 
that particular process. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So you never attended any meetings 
beneficiaries in …? 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  I have - I have never attended any 
meetings with the beneficiaries in Vrede. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  Thank you Chair.  That would be all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Moremi for having come to 
give evidence.  We appreciate it very much.  If we need you again we 
will ask you to come back but thank you very much.  For now you are 
20 
excused. 
MR TEKOETSILE MOSES MOREMI:  Thank you Chair and let me also 
appreciate the opportunity given to me to present my evidence.  Thanks 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 112 of 113 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair Ms Gcabashe would like to address 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman as I indicated earlier the - this 
is our only witness today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would like to do a rain check on the 
availability of our witness tomorrow and I am wondering what the best 
way is to proceed in that regard.  If we should simply come back and 
see you in Chambers later on to confirm that that witness will be 
10 
proceeding tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As we speak now I suspect you do not know 
everything that you should know to be able to share with me in 
chambers about tomorrow? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  At this point in time not yet Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  It is - it is fine.  What we should do is let 
us be in touch after two but we will not come back here.  Let us be in 
touch so as to talk about tomorrow.  Just for the sake of everybody else 
there is a witness who is supposed to give evidence tomorrow but there 
are circumstances which may necessitate that her evidence should not 
20 
be heard tomorrow but we are only going to know later. 
So if there will be no hearing tomorrow as a result of 
decisions that will be taken later the media will be informed through the 
usual channels but if there is no communication to the media that there 
will be no hearing tomorrow it will mean that there will be hearing 
13 AUGUST 2019 – DAY 143 
 
Page 113 of 113 
 
tomorrow or at least that we will meet at 10 o’ clock and whatever 
decisions might need to be taken would be taken then. 
So if you receive communication it will - it will say that there 
will be no hearing.  If you do not receive any communication it will 
mean we will meet tomorrow and we will meet and then either decide 
then or we will meet and have a hearing.  Is that fine with you? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That is in order.  Thank you very much 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Okay.  We are going to then adjourn on 
that understanding.  If we do not - if there is no hearing tomorrow it is 
10 
likely that there will be a hearing on Thursday and Friday.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
