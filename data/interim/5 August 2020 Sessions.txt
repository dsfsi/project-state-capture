PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 05 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Ms Mokoena, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV MOLEFE:  Good morning Chair it is Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Molefe I am sorry.   
ADV MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I am ageing why should I get your 
surname wrong after you have been with the commission for 
three years. 
ADV MOLEFE:  Yes – all is forgiven Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We – I need to give the – my 
decision in the matter of Mr Lungisa Fuzile’s application for 
Leave to Cross-examine Mr Van Rooyen.  You are for the 
commission’s legal team.  I think there is appearance for 
both Mr Fuzile and Mr Van Rooyen.  Is that right? 
ADV MOLEFE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay 
maybe 
they 
can 
just 
place 
themselves on record – on record from where they are. 
ADV RAJAH:  Chair Hester Barata appearing for Mr Fuzile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MOTHA:  Chair Mr Motsai Mamotsha [?] from Lucky 
Thekisho Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOTHA:  We are presenting the respondent Mr Des Van 
Rooyen. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 4 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  
ADV MOTHA:  We are here to note the judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MOTHA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.  I have prepared brief 
reasons for the decision.  I do not propose to read the 
decision but I have noticed one or two typographical errors 
which will need to be corrected in the course of the morning.  
So the decision can be sent to all parties at some stage 
today.  I will just read out the decision and the reasons are 
10 
set out in the decision that would be emailed to the – not to 
the parties.  I have reached a conclusion that it is not in the 
best interest of the function of the commission to grant Mr 
Fuzile leave to cross-examine Mr Van Rooyen that is the 
conclusion I have reached and the last sentence or line of 
the decision then reads: 
“In all of the circumstances I conclude that Mr Fuzile’s 
application falls to be dismissed accordingly it is dismissed.” 
ADV MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair.  Chair may I please take 
about five minutes of an adjournment for Mr Pretorius to 
20 
come and address you.  I believe there are several other 
matters he will be dealing with unless he is ready to proceed 
at this current moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is sitting that other side.  If he needs 
five minutes, we will do that.  Do you need five minutes Mr 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 5 of 127 
 
Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [Not speaking into 
microphone]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Thank you.  I will – otherwise 
those who need to be excused are excused. 
ADV MOLEFE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair as alluded to yesterday the 
10 
witness set down for today is Mr Mokhetsi.  He is 
represented by attorney and counsel who are here to make 
an application before you and I will respond after hearing Mr 
Fouche. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Counsel if you can make your 
– move your application from there or move to the podium if 
they sanitise.   
ADV FOUCHE:  Thank you Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Chairperson I appear on behalf of Mr 
20 
Mokhetsi in this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Mr Mokhetsi is present he is not running 
away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay maybe start by just placing 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 6 of 127 
 
yourself on record. 
ADV FOUCHE:  My surname is Fouche. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  G V R 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Thank you Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Chairperson Mr Mokhetsi he cooperated up 
until now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FOUCHE:  He is still cooperating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  He filed two affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  One on the request of the commission after 
his first affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  However, he was represented by the state 
attorney of Bloemfontein which – or Free State up until – 
well at the end of June there were some – some signs that 
20 
they might withdraw as attorneys for Mr Mokhetsi and then 
that was only confirmed in – on a letter of 17 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  That letter was addressed to his Counsel at 
that stage Mr Tswyhele [?] and Mr Tswyhele also was leaded 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 7 of 127 
 
by what I gathered from it by a Mr Hellens SC.  So that 17 
July that came to his attention on the 20 July that the state 
attorney definitely withdrawing as his attorney of record. 
Then on the 27 July the – a Mr Lambrechts being the 
investigator of the inquiry of the commission he sent an 
email to Mr Mokhetsi in person making him aware of today’s 
date the 5 August.  So that is today exactly one week ago on 
a Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  After that Mr Mokhetsi obtained legal 
10 
representation from Mr Peyper in Bloemfontein and I am on 
brief on behalf of Mr Peyper in this matter.  So at the 
moment Chairman I am basically playing off the bench.  I am 
playing as a substitute player in the last minutes of this 
game.  So I am not in a position to give any sound legal 
advice at the moment to Mr Mokhetsi.  I am not aware of any 
of the background of this whole investigation.  I have 
consulted only this morning with Mr Mokhetsi and he – he 
told me that in his view he would like Mr Hellens to remain 
on brief.  In his view Mr Hellens is the person that – that 
20 
assisted him throughout also in drafting the affidavits.  So he 
is the – he is the Counsel – the Senior Counsel with the 
knowledge at the moment and the current legal team simply 
does not have the legal knowledge to assist him sufficiently.  
He is the HOD of the Department.  It is important evidence 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 8 of 127 
 
that will be led by him.  He is not running Chairperson.  He is 
more than willing to testify.  What we gathered also in 
respect of yesterday’s hearing and from the introduction from 
Mr Pretorius is that there is plenty of documents involved in 
that.  Mr Mokhetsi is not sure whether he has seen all of 
these documents.  We have been told this morning that those 
documents might have been given to the state attorney of 
Bloemfontein we do not know.  We certainly do not have 
them.  I do not – did not have any sight of them.  My 
attorneys did not have sight of them.  So we are in a very 
10 
difficult position and we not – Mr Mokhetsi is not in a 
position to testify today.  However he will cooperate, he will 
testify and we are simply seeking an indulgence for two 
weeks if possible so that those documents can be scrutinised 
by him and if he has got a new legal team if Mr Hellens does 
not stay on board so that they have the opportunity to – and 
he will have the proper opportunity to – well his evidence 
before the commission in a better fashion I suppose. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  If he had sight of those documents.  
20 
Because he might feel like he is being ambushed if new 
documents being introduced to him and he might not be able 
to assist this commission as such in that.  So Chairperson in 
short those are my submissions, the reasons are basically – 
oh what I have not mentioned is that Mr Hellens tested 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 9 of 127 
 
positive for Covid seven to ten days ago if I am not 
mistaken.  So he cannot be here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Initially when the state attorney was still on 
– well was still the attorney for Mr Mokhetsi and he agreed 
to be here during this week he still had attorneys of record 
being the state attorneys and Mr Hellens would have been 
available and subsequent to that letter that came to his 
attention on the 20t h July that changed dramatically and that 
is why we – we are not in a position to proceed.  He is not in 
10 
a position to give evidence and we seek that indulgence Mr 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you know whether the position is 
that had Mr Hellens not tested positive for Covid-19 they 
would have been able to proceed today? 
ADV FOUCHE:  What I gathered in the consultation this 
morning Chairperson is that he was available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was available? 
ADV FOUCHE:  That is what I gathered but at that stage 
then the state attorney was also still his attorney. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  And he was briefed by them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  I cannot answer whether he will remain on 
brief. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 10 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Even when he returns whether he will be 
able to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV FOUCHE:  But initially when – when the dates of this 
week was given Mr Hellens was according to my instructions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was available. 
ADV FOUCHE:  He was available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well if I postpone, we look at where – 
what date we can postpone but we are pressed for time as 
10 
everybody knows the [indistinct] the commission. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we have started to arrange for what 
we call evening sessions.  That is an arrangement in terms 
of which during the day there would be witness who gives 
evidence during the day or witnesses who give evidence 
during the day and when we finish with them at four o’clock 
or thereabout we start with an evening – we start our 
evening session so then maybe people that we say come at 
four o’clock you will give evidence during the evening 
20 
session.  Maybe from 4 to 7, maybe from 4 to 8 that kind of 
thing.  So I am just – I just want to say if I do postpone there 
is that possibility that he could be fitted into an evening 
session. 
ADV FOUCHE:  I also… 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 11 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that – that should not be a 
problem. 
ADV FOUCHE:  I have already canvassed that with Mr 
Mokhetsi and he is more than willing to even sit in the 
evenings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Okay no that is fine.  Let me 
hear what Mr Pretorius has to say. 
ADV FOUCHE:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Chair we did in preparation for this 
10 
morning’s 
application 
obtain 
a 
full 
history 
of 
the 
engagements between the parties.  It is not necessary to go 
through it in any detail because it is common cause that the 
date today was a matter of agreement between the parties 
including legal representatives.  May I just say in relation to 
the application Mr Mokhetsi is an important witness.  He is 
an implicated person and he is the accounting officer in 
respect of this project and I think in those circumstances 
Chair it is important that we make every effort to act fairly 
towards him so that he may fairly account for the questions 
20 
that need to be put to him in relation to his role as 
accounting officer in this matter.  Chair there has been some 
discussion about the availability of records.  In that respect I 
have just taken instructions from the investigator who 
interviewed Mr Mokhetsi on the 30 October 2019 and the 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 12 of 127 
 
transcript shows that there was a full discussion between the 
investigators and the legal representatives of Mr Mokhetsi in 
relation to the availability of documents – the documents that 
were shown to him and of course many of the relevant 
documents were in the possession of Mr Mokhetsi or at least 
under his control and I think that is an important feature.  It 
may be that the – the ball has – or the boot is on the other 
foot because we – we may require documents that have not 
been given to us.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  The hearing of Mr Mokhetsi’s 
10 
evidence which was scheduled for today is postponed to a 
date to be determined and he has indicated his commitment 
to appear before the commission and to give evidence and to 
cooperate with the commission.  An attempt will be made to 
try and communicate the date in the next few days so that it 
might not be two weeks as you asked for but every attempt 
will be made to not delay the hearing of his evidence unduly.  
But you have indicated that the Counsel that he would prefer 
to assist him tested positive and about 7 or so days ago so 
one might bare that in mind in fixing the date.  So the 
20 
application for a postponement is granted and the date will 
be communicated to all concerned in the next few days.  We 
are going to adjourn because Mr Mokhetsi was going to be 
the only witness for the day it means we are not sitting for 
the next few hours but this afternoon at five o’clock the 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 13 of 127 
 
commission will sit to hear the evidence of Judge Makhubele 
as arranged a few days ago.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good evening everybody.  I do not know if 
it is late afternoon or it is evening already but – this late 
afternoon/evening we have our first evening session as the 
commission.  We announced last week that there will be 
evening sessions to try and make sure that we use as much 
10 
time as we can have to expedite our work and the hearing of 
evidence so that we finish the commission’s work within the 
time that has been given to us.   
 
This evening we are going to do what we were 
supposed to do on Monday but could not do in the afternoon 
because of certain reasons. 
 
I am going to hear the evidence of Judge Makhubele.  
For now, I have not made a decision Judge Makhubele’s 
application for “the recusal of Advocate Soni SC” and – but 
we will use this time to give Judge Makhubele an opportunity 
20 
to present her side of the story but also for me to put certain 
questions to her.  The contemplation is that there would still 
be another day when an evidence leader can put questions 
to Judge Makhubele once I have either decided on the so 
called recusal application or if I have decided or found 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 14 of 127 
 
somebody who can then lead the evidence for practical 
purposes.  So that is why Mr Soni is not at the podium today 
but he is here and I will call upon him to assist me with 
regard to finding certain document that I might need at a 
certain stage because he and his junior are maybe quite 
familiar with the location of various documents in the bundle.  
So there will be two parts. 
1. I will allow Judge Makhubele the opportunity to tell her 
side of the story to a very large extent I will not be 
asking her questions during that time.  I am going to 
10 
limit that to thirty minutes and she has indicated that 
she is happy with that allocation of time.  And 
thereafter I will put questions to her and then she will 
deal with the questions that I will put to her. 
I think for the purposes of refreshing the memories of the 
public and whoever may be listening it is important to say 
that 
Judge 
Makhubele’s 
evidence 
falls 
under 
the 
investigation that the commission is doing in regard to 
various allegations of corruption and acts of state capture at 
PRASA.  And Ms Martha Ngoye who is Head of the Legal 
20 
Department at PRASA as well as Mr Dingiswayo who is also 
in the same department at PRASA gave evidence on a 
number of matters but their evidence also included what they 
said was the role played by Judge Makhubele when she was 
chairperson of the board of PRASA from – towards the end 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 15 of 127 
 
of 2017 to about – it was end of March of mid-March 2018 
when she resigned.  The part of the allegations they made 
was that Judge Makhubele came to PRASA and had a special 
interest in the settling of certain cases which had been 
brought by certain companies falling under a group called – 
a group of companies called Siyaya Group.  That company 
had allegedly entered into certain contracts with PRASA and 
according to it – or according to those companies they had 
performed certain services for PRASA and PRASA had failed 
to pay them when it was obliged to do so.  And those matters 
10 
had been lodged in court and PRASA had filed its defences, 
its pleas but ultimately there was an agreement that the 
matters should go to arbitration and they were going to 
arbitrated. 
 
So 
Ms 
Ngoye 
testified 
that 
after 
Judge 
Makhubele had been – started being Chairperson of the 
Board of PRASA she insisted that the claims by those 
specific entities of – falling under Siyaya should be settled 
and that her department was excluded.  And Mr Dingiswayo 
testified that on the 15 December 2017 she phoned – he 
phoned the attorneys who represented PRASA in those 
20 
arbitration proceedings Mogashwa Attorneys in order to 
discuss the matter but was told by Mr Mogashwa that the 
Chairperson of the Board that is Judge Makhubele had 
instructed that the attorneys should not speak to the legal 
department of PRASA about those matters.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 16 of 127 
 
 
The long and short of it is that the matters were 
settled and the allegations that the attorneys for Siyaya 
Group got information that came from the Chairperson of 
PRASA, Judge Makhubele that would not be expected to 
have been sent to the other side and there was a question of 
how it had come about that PRASA’s opponents in the 
litigation on the arbitration got information that they should 
not have got.  In particular it was information about how 
PRASA’s attorneys had been instructed to settle the matters. 
 
After the matters had been settled Siyaya’s lawyers 
10 
and PRASA’s lawyers made arrangements in terms of which 
they appeared before the arbitrator who is a retired Judge 
and the settlement agreement was made an order of court so 
awards were made which required PRASA to make payments 
to the Siyaya Group and the amounts altogether appeared to 
have been in the region of about R59 million that PRASA had 
to pay. 
 
There was also interest that was supposed to be paid 
and when PRASA did not pay those amounts the Siyaya 
Group of Companies approached the court to make the 
20 
arbitration awards an order of court. 
 
By that time the legal department of PRASA had been 
in touch with the newly appointed Minister of Transport 
Doctor Nzimande who had – and had told him what they 
believed was happening and the role that they believed 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 17 of 127 
 
Judge Makhubele had played and he had instructed that the 
legal department should take steps to try and in effect 
reverse that process. 
 
So the arbitration awards had been made orders of 
court but subsequently a rescission application was made 
and those were rescinded but the legal department had also 
to bring an interdict application – urgent interdict application 
to prevent the sheriff from paying over millions of PRASA’s 
money to the Siyaya Group because in the meantime Siyaya 
Group – the Siyaya Group had attached money in PRASA’s 
10 
bank account.   
So Ms Ngoye and her department instructed another 
law firm Bowmans in order to assist with regard to that.  Also 
there their evidence was to the effect that there was some 
drama in court because when comes and briefed by 
Bowmans sought to oppose it was found that Counsel for 
Siyaya Group was able to show the Judge a message that 
had been received according to them from Judge Makhubele 
which said that the – lawyers representing PRASA which 
sought to oppose the Siyaya Group’s application had no 
20 
authority to do so and the Judge had ultimately accepted 
that and granted the order.  
But ultimately the rescission application that was 
brought by PRASA was successful and those amounts were 
not paid over. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 18 of 127 
 
So I thought I would summarise the gist of the 
evidence given by them.  There are other details but it is just 
refreshing the memory of the public so that also they can 
understand this evening’s evidence in its proper context. 
As I said what I will do after Judge Makhubele has 
taken the oath I will give her about thirty minutes to tell her 
side of the story and after thirty minutes I will then ask her 
questions.  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Tintswalo Annah Makhubele. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do you consider the oath to be 
binding on your conscience? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help me 
God. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Judge Makhubele.  
You now have thirty minutes to tell your side of the story. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Thank you Chairperson.  Before – 
before that I think I need to place on record the issues about 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 19 of 127 
 
the documents that I was provided on Monday.  They are 
behind me so even for two minutes if I can deal with that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think – I think somebody can help 
you to bring them to you.  Somebody will bring them to your 
– in front of you. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I do not know what is the best way to 
deal with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they might put them… 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  What I wanted to say maybe because 
they were handed over to me in a hurry there is one bundle 
10 
which… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can tell you that what the way to 
distinguish them you should look at the spine of each one.  
Each one is supposed to be written Bundle 1 or Bundle 2 or 
Bundle 3 each one of them. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  No I – I have.  What I want to say is 
that one bundle which contains the documents of one Lucky 
Montana nothing to do with me at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So I just want to say ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...it is a whole file and... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, they can take that away. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So when it means documents, you 
must not say I came and stole it. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245

CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]   
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
[laughs] 
 
Lucky 
Montana’s 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja-no, I think they must ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
If 
it 
can 
be 
removed 
from 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be removed from... 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  From my side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ms Renate, look for that one and 
take it away. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It says, “additional documents”.  
These are all Montana’s documents.  My story Chair is in the 
bundle where I responded to Advocate Botes’ affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I was given my registrar a 
message here.  Just start afresh please. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I am told it is Bundle J.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the one that has got Mr Botes’ 
affidavit and your affidavit as well? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes.  In... there is an attachment in 
my response to Advocate Botes’ affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is a statement of referral of a 
complaint in the Pretoria Bar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I am not sure if it has been paginated 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 21 of 127 
 
by... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I have seen it.  I have read it.  So I 
am sure it is here.  It is ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is... the pagination is the red 
stamp. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually, normally we use the red but I 
think where you see the red and the black, follow the black 
one at the... it is rather top left of each page.  Mr Soni, that 
is correct, hey? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I think it is the ...[indistinct] [dip in 
10 
recording] The flag is... there are so many flags, same 
numbers but I see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I see ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  SS19-TAM.-46. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, when you refer to the page, then you 
can leave out SS19 and TAM and the zero.  You can just say 
43, if it is ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  45. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, is it 45? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So that is 45.

CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but that is red.  Let us try and... what 
is the black number? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  The black... I do not know whether it 
is me who must be BB? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think I am going to find 45 now.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 22 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Oh, the black is 147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just put... switch on your mic from the... 
Mr Soni. 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 146. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One-forty... the black 146? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay page 146.  Okay.  I have got that.  
But that is the last page, hey?  Where does it... at what page 
does it start?  Can you find that Judge Makhubele? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is 147. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It starts at...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It starts at 147. 
CHAIRPERSON:  147?  Oh, okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, your “statement of referral”.  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay page 147.  That is the black 147. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes, Chair.  Remember I have said, I 
have not provided a sworn statement.  I am still going to do 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...the essence of the statement is 
what is in here. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 23 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And as I have indicated, I will have 
to make certain additions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...based on the oral testimony of Ms 
Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo which I have not considered.  I 
have been given transcripts yesterday at night.  I think 
around seven or eight.  So I... from what I could quickly 
glean out, I need to file a proper sworn statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So today Chair the 30-minutes may 
not even be enough to deal the... the main evidence or 
allegations against me are by Ms Ngoye. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So I will still deal with Mr Mogashoa 
and Mr Botes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Mr Achmat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And Mr Madimpe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let us see how much you have been 
able to cover by 30-minutes and take it from there. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, the other thing... remember 
Chair, now I am attorney and client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 24 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And [laughs]  I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  [laughs]  And counsel. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And counsel and everything.  And 
yesterday, I wrote a letter which I am not... I do not even 
think it has reached you.   
 
Where... because I wanted to understand exactly what 
are the allegations here that you are investigating because 
remember, everything comes from the affidavit that Ms 
Ngoye filed at Pretoria High Court and which I have here. 
 
So the complainants here have filed a complaint at the 
10 
JCC but they have added other things which I want to be 
certain that here ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, here you are expected to deal with 
the witnesses’ affidavit as filed here. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  As filed here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  As filed here, yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Because there is a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you have got.  
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  There is confusion, even in the 
public domain that... there are so many allegations.  Nothing 
to do, the settlement of their claims which I believe that is 
what I must respond to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m-h’m-h’m. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 25 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Here before you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja-no, for our purposes, you look at the 
affidavits that they have filed here ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...which have been given to you. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Thank you.  In this statement 148... 
147, I have summarised... I was... I wrote this statement with 
reference to the affidavit that Ms Ngoye filed in... dated 
3 April 2018 in the application where PRASA was seeking to 
interdict the Sheriff from executing the Writ. 
10 
 
So this statement is an answer, basically, to this 
affidavit.  I see there are complaints here.  They tried to 
abridge it a bit but here I dealt with the circumstances under 
which those claims were settled. 
 
And basically, I denied that... or let me start here.  I had 
an opportunity yesterday to look at Ms Ngoye’s complete 
affidavit in... that she had filed here, dealing with everyone 
and every issue. 
 
And I made notes because I was asking myself what 
exactly is her role and what is she saying.   
20 
 
And I see she says in paragraph twenty... paragraph 7 of 
the affidavit before you Chair that the leaders in PRASA 
have been found wanting in various reports. 
 
She referred to the reports of the Auditor General, 
Public Protector, National Treasury.   And 
in 
paragraph 
25 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 26 of 127 
 
talking about Siyaya matters.   
 
She said that it is not her intention to persuade this 
Commission about the merits of PRASA’s ...[indistinct]  but 
she just wants to show the length, often improper, to which 
people at PRASA went out to ensure that PRASA, it pays 
money that is not due. 
 
And one of those people that she describes, I believe, it 
is me.  And that is where it starts.  So firstly, I deny that I am 
one of the people who have been found wanting in any report 
of the ...[indistinct], the AG, National Treasury, Public 
10 
Protector or any court of law. 
 
So I am not one of those people.  There is no one who 
has ever found me guilty or made any findings against me in 
relation to wrongdoings at PRASA.  That is the first 
statement I am making Chairperson. 
 
And secondly, I deny because she might have deleted 
her initial evidence but the initial evidence in the affidavit 
before court was that the settlements were done in secrecy.  
The legal section which she was heading was not consulted 
and actually no one was consulted.  That was the basis for 
20 
her complaint. 
 
And most importantly, that the settlement was done in 
furtherance 
of 
what 
she 
refers 
to 
as 
a 
questionable 
relationship 
between 
me 
and 
the 
lawyers 
who 
were 
representing Siyaya in the liquidation application. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 27 of 127 
 
 
So in this Chairperson, I highlight the circumstances.  I 
will not deal with how I was appointed through the PRASA 
Board but I will deal with... well, the circumstances under 
which the claim was settled and it starts at paragraph 9 of 
this statement.  That will be your page 151. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay that is still... that is page 151 
of Bundle J.  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you may continue. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Paragraph 9 with its sub-paragraphs 
10 
and there are annexures Chairperson which, unfortunately... 
I did send the annexures to the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But I see they are not been 
paginated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, but because you...  I mean, there 
is the overall pagination which is the black numbers 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...at the top.  You can use that.  But with 
20 
reference to your own statement, there are... we have 
numbered the paragraphs. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you can refer to the number... the 
paragraph numbers as well. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 28 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, when... sorry, when I use the 
word paginated, I mean the annexures are not part of the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So Chairperson will not be able today 
to see the documents I am referring to.  For instance, when I 
say: 
“The 
liquidators 
approached 
me, 
first 
through 
Advocate Botes and then they wrote a letter to me...” 
 
Chairperson will not be able to see that letter because I 
10 
do not know if it is part of... yes, this letter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I have got some ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  The letter ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...annexures. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  The letter is part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But there are a lot which are not part 
but there are a few that are part but when I come back 
Chairperson, I think we will have all the annexures but the 
letter of the liquidators is in this ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you do have those annexures which 
are not here, in your possession at the moment, there may 
be an opportunity for copies to be paid.  But if you do not 
have them, then next time we can look at them.  Do you have 
them by any chance with you? 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 29 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, I... I did send them to Ms 
Renata but I do not know if she compiled a bundle of those 
annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, let me ask.  Mr Soni, you know about 
any other annexures to statement referring the complaint to 
the bar council?  It may be that they were not included 
because they might not have been seen as relevant for our 
purposes.  Yes? 
ADV SONI SC:  That given the limited nature of the 
allegation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And this was an allegation against Mr Baltac. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  We tried to respect the ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What you consider to be important.   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But would they be available within the 
legal team?  So I guess they would be available even if we 
are not here?  
20 
ADV SONI SC:  I am sure they would be available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, okay.  Alright.  I think 
arrangements will be made if you think they are relevant.  As 
Mr Soni says, they try to say, “Look, what is really important 
for 
purposes 
of 
the 
Commission’s 
own 
investigation 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 30 of 127 
 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
As 
opposed 
to 
the 
bar 
council’s 
investigation.  If they are relevant, they can be obtained.  So 
for next time, you can refer to them. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, for my purpose they are 
relevant because those are internal PRASA document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I see Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo 
only attached my memorandum. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But then there are documents that 
were generated within the board and from the secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Relating to what I am talking about 
here.  For instance, I will need to refer to the delegation of 
authority which Chairperson, obviously, need to see.  And 
the relevance of it is that I see... I saw Ms Ngoye attached a 
delegation of authority. 
 
But my submission is that is not what was given to the 
20 
board and I have proof of what was given to the board.  So 
everything that I have sent is relevant but I will ensure that I 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You, you... 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I compile the bundle myself. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 31 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And when I give a sworn statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For next time.  Okay.  Alright. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But in the first few paragraphs I deal 
with their approaches.  And you remember Chair, that there 
was an issue between me... Mr Botes came here and 
testified that I called him and then our phones were 
subjected to investigations. 
 
There is a report from the investigation... that it is part 
of the bundles here.  So Chair, that matter must be settled.  
10 
The report of the investigator shows that... well, obviously, 
he cannot say with certainty but he says it is probable based 
on what he has analysed. 
 
It is probable that Advocate Botes is the one who 
contacted me first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  First? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Remember, he came here and made 
a lot of noise that I called him.  So that issue Chair, you will 
20 
be referred to the relevant report that it is settled, he is the 
one who called me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, he did testify that you called her 
first. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  He called him, yes. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 32 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes.  There is a report from the 
investigator here that that should settle the issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Unless Advocate Botes would like to 
take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think what we will... what the 
Commission’s legal team or investigators will do is, if they 
have not already done, is to make that report available to 
him for his comments. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you will be informed or send a copy of 
his comments as well. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So for now, I stand by my paragraph 
9.1 that he called me first in the week... I said in the second 
week of November 2017 forward... followed by a letter.  The 
letter is from his attorneys.   
 
And then Advocate Botes came in person to PRASA 
because I said to him, I cannot discuss with him anywhere 
else other than at PRASA.  At the time I was still a member 
20 
of the bar.  So my chambers were still open.   
 
But I said, “Let us meet.”  Rather, “Meet at PRASA than 
anywhere because as far as I am concerned, what you are 
telling me requires a transparent engagement involving 
everyone including my colleagues at the board.  And the then 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 33 of 127 
 
acting Group Secretary who is Mr Zide.   
 
He then came.  The date was, I think in my statement I 
say 13t h but looking at my notes, the date there should be 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it not the 14t h? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is 14t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  14t h of November 2017. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  The date was 2017, November.  He 
10 
found with Mr Zide because on that day, I was in several 
meetings.  That is why I was at PRASA.  I said to him when 
he comes, I will take time off and took to him. 
 
But by the time he came, he had already told me what 
he... what it was all about which was basically what is in 
email exchange between him and Mr Madimpe Mogashoa, 
that the parties involved in litigation.   
 
There were those claims.  Several case number but 
which were then consolidated because there is an arbitration 
clause. 
20 
 
My understanding is, it was not simple that there is a... 
we agreed to go on arbitration.  There is an arbitration 
clause.  PRASA took a point that you cannot proceed by way 
of action because there is an arbitration clause. 
 
And then there was an agreement to withdraw and go to 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 34 of 127 
 
arbitration.  And in the meantime, as Chair... I do not 
know....  I cannot remember if Chair has summarised this. 
 
But then in the meantime, the part or of the claimants 
went on voluntarily liquidation.  And then there was a call... 
an application to go... to appoint a commissioner to conduct 
an inquiry. 
 
The inquiry, when I went to PRASA, had already been 
concluded.  There was an interim report of the commissioner.  
His name is Mr Kruger.  He had issued an interim report. 
 
So when Mr Botes came to PRASA, he came with that 
10 
interim report and correspondence between him and Mr 
Madimpe Mogashoa. 
 
I do not have a lawyer next to me Chairperson.  I wanted 
to refer to the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  To the report? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  To the report.  You... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well, Mr Soni is able to assist with 
the work. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So the part of the liquid... of the 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the liquidator? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Of the... not the liquidator.  Of the 
commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the commissioner.  Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is ...[intervenes]  
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 35 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page?  Where do you find 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is in the statement of Mr Botes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just hang on.  Mr Soni might be able to 
just tell us what page to find it. 
ADV SONI SC:  It is page 28 as an annexure to ...[indistinct] 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What volume first?  What bundle? 
ADV SONI SC:  Oh, sorry.  The Bundle is J Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle J.  And what black number? 
10 
ADV SONI SC:  Page 28.  It is only that number Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  What is it... where do we find it? 
ADV SONI SC:  It is page 28. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes, I found it.  In my bundle, it is J.  
The black number J/-065.  The red number is 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Soni, you said it is page 
twenty...? 
ADV SONI SC:  It is page 28 on the right-hand side, the red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red one? 
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  We need to be consisted if we use the 
black ones.  [laughs]   
ADV SONI SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you said there was no black number 
on the page? 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 36 of 127 
 
ADV SONI SC:  No, on mine... but apparently yours has it 
and ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja mine does have. 
ADV SONI SC:  And if I can just explain what happened 
here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  The bundles were prepared with the... with 
Judge Makhubele’s complaint put at the top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SONI SC:  And so the pages had to be renumbered. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SONI SC:  Because Mr Botes gave evidence first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay that is fine. 
ADV SONI SC:  So that is why the number... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SONI SC:  And then what we did is, we took Judge 
Makhubele’s complaint which he has been referring to and 
we have put it as part of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that is fine.  The commissioner’s 
interim report is at page 65 in terms of the black numbers.  
20 
Yes, Judge Makhubele we are there. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Are you there Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got it. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes.  So that is the commissioner’s 
interim report of the inquiry in terms of Section 417(1) and 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 37 of 127 
 
418(2) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 read with Item 9, 
305(?) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008. 
 
And it gives a brief summary of the evidence that he 
explains in paragraph 1, his appointment, the company 
resolution and that he has read an inquiry on 28 and 
31 August 2017. 
 
And then paragraph 3, who was representing who.  Mr 
Botes was representing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think you might wish to just go 
straight to the real issues you wanted ...[intervenes]  
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  To the real issues ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...you wanted to draw my attention to. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other stuff, I can read for myself. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE:  Yes.  Maybe paragraph... the 
representation for PRASA is indicated as mister... the head 
council, Mr Tsatsawane and the instructing attorney was Mr 
Madiwe(?). 
 
The witnesses Chairperson are in paragraph 4.  It is... 
there are six witnesses.  The relevance of this paragraph is 
20 
because I mentioned somewhere that I consulted with these 
witnesses. 
 
And these are the witnesses who were still employed at 
PRASA.  And that will be your Mr S Baltac and Mr 
...[indistinct] And then there are those who had been issued 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 38 of 127 
 
with subpoenas but not yet appeared. 
 
I think they are... I will talk about them.  Maybe there 
are two or three.  But in this list, the ones that were still at 
PRASA is Mr Baltac and mister... the one in 4.4. 
 
So I never had any consultation or dealings with people 
who are no longer at PRASA.  That is the point I want to 
make. 
 
And then the summary of the evidence of each witness.  
I am not sure if Chairperson has already... already has this 
evidence on record so that I do not repeat it but maybe 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, you can make the... what you consider 
to be important features ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...of what he says for your case. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Then maybe the only... the witnesses 
that I consulted with.  The evidence of Mr Sorin Baltac.  Mr 
Sorin Baltac, in addition to this, wrote a report to me which I 
will give Chairperson.   
 
I saw it somewhere in the annexures in the court 
20 
application but I do not think it has been annexed in the 
documents  before you. 
 
So in the addition to this, Mr Baltac gives... also 
provided a report.  And his evidence... he was asked to 
testify.  He says he is a general manager signalling and 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 39 of 127 
 
telecommunication. 
 
And he was asked to testify about the project, 
indicated the technical assistance for supervision of national 
signalling project stage 1, phases 1 to 5 agreement and then 
he confirmed the agreement entered into between PRASA 
and the company in liquidation on that 31 May 2011 and 
indicates the amount just above 4 million.  He confirmed he 
was personally involved and had personal knowledge of the 
way the contract was implemented and executed.  
 
The reason I want this on record, Chair, is because 
10 
the issues raised are that I said there were concessions by 
the witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So that is not me, it is what the 
report is saying. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 Yes, 
I think 
what 
– 
I 
think 
my 
understanding is that what has been said is that you said 
that in terms of the interim report it is said that they made 
major concessions.  I thought that was what was said but 
you can deal with it and respond to it if you never said – if 
20 
all you said was, I am relying on the report because it said 
they had major concessions, that is fine. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, you can use the word 
measure or concessions, there amount would probably not 
be really an issue, Chair, because what is being contended 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 40 of 127 
 
is that the witnesses never considered anything.  So it is a 
– 
when 
issues 
are 
concession 
are 
being 
met 
it 
is 
something very strange.  But, you know, English is not my 
first language but when I see the word confirm and then I 
also consult with the very same person and ask him look at 
this report, they say you – this is what you told the 
Commissioner, did you really tell the Commissioner what is 
written here?  And the person says yes, that is what I said.   
 
And the person writes as even a separate report to 
you saying yes, that is what I said and I am not talking 
10 
about an illiterate – let me not use the word illiterate, I am 
not talking about a person who is not illiterate, who may 
say maybe the report was not – I do not know what is 
written, it is not what I said, but it is a person that actually 
confirms what is in this report, Chairperson, so I will give 
Mr 
Soni’s 
separate 
statement 
from 
this, 
what 
the 
Commissioner 
has 
written 
as 
well 
as 
after 
I 
have 
transcribed my notes that these are the dates but to me, 
these are concessions, whether you want to classify them 
as major, minor, but they go to the heart of the issues that 
20 
was asked to deal with, so… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was looking at paragraph 5 where 
it talks about Baltac, 5.1.7 at page 67, if you look at the 
black numbers.  Is that where you are as well? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   They testified about – to I think 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 41 of 127 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I thought you were talking 
about Mr Baltac’s… 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, he starts at page 29, the 
bottom of 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well it says – it says that - 5.1.2: 
Mr Baltac confirmed that he was familiar with the 
above 
agreement 
which 
was 
entered 
into 
and 
concluded between PRASA and the company in 
liquidation on the 31 May 2011 which was for 
10 
technical assistance for the supervision of national 
re-signalling project, stage 1, this is 1 to 5, and that 
the value of the contract was R54 537 600. 
Then 5.1.3: 
“He 
further 
confirmed 
that 
he 
was 
personally 
involved and had personal knowledge of the way the 
contract was implemented and executed and that 
according 
to 
his 
knowledge 
the 
company 
had 
complied with the conditions of the contract.  Mr 
Baltac also said that he had no reason to believe 
20 
that the company had not complied with the terms 
of the contract according to the company.  The 
amount outstanding in terms of the contract is 
R15 319 491.01.  Mr Baltac could not confirm or 
deny that this figure was accurate and agreed to 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 42 of 127 
 
consult PRASA’s records to confirm what was due in 
terms of the contract and then never – and referred 
back to the liquidators and the Commission with the 
correct amount.  The 8 September 2007 I received a 
letter from PRASA’s attorneys in which they said 
that their clients were investigating the matter and 
that they would as soon as possible make their 
findings available to the Commission.” 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, so subsequent to this, the 
report that I will give, Chairperson, which Mr Mogashoa 
10 
also acknowledged having received was Mr Baltac was 
reporting back to the Commission, the Commissioner to say 
remember in that paragraph the only 5.1.5, the only issue 
was the amount, which he said he was tasked to do and 
investigate the amount of the invoice.   
 
Then in the report, that I will give you, Chairperson, 
he was confirming that he has made investigations and 
then the amount, the correct amount is this and I think it is 
less than this 15 million if my memory serves me well.  So 
his task was to confirm the amount because the claim was 
20 
15 million and Mr Sonic was not certain and then he came 
back with a report that says no, it is not 15 million it is less 
than that, so that is with regard to this agreement and then 
he also testified about the other agreement it is titled 
Consultancy Agreement for Technical Adviser for the New 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 43 of 127 
 
Digital 
Railway 
Signalling 
Unit, 
work 
contract 
HO-
infra(E)301/01/2013.   
In the summons, in the pleadings you will see which 
claim relates to which contract.  There is a contract 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And that is how they are identified. 
So he also – he testified and then he – 5.1.8, he was 
familiar 
with 
the 
agreement 
and 
according 
to 
my 
understanding he was someone who can call the supervisor 
10 
when – during implementation stage he will be the person 
overseeing the work.  And then 5.1.8 he says: 
“The Commissioner says it appears the amount due 
in respect of agreement would not agreed upon by 
the 
parties 
to 
the 
contract 
so 
the 
company 
represented by Mabunda its former CEO and Mr 
Baltac agreed to meet to try and calculate the 
amount which is due and payable to the company 
and to submit their answer to the Commission and 
their liquidators by 11 September 2017.” 
20 
And then the next page, 5.1.9: 
“On the 6 September the Commissioner received a 
letter by email from PRASA’s attorneys addressed 
to 
the 
Commissioner 
and 
the 
liquidator ’s 
representative Mr Boshoff in which they confirmed 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 44 of 127 
 
that client Mr Baltac was requested to engage with 
Mr Mabunda to calculate the amount which is due in 
terms of the contract that number.” 
So you can see there, Chairperson, that the parties are in 
agreement about what outstanding issues they must still 
investigate and I will look in my records but I think this 
letter is in some bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So that was the issue and in the 
aforesaid letter they said that: 
10 
“The contract was with a company called Siyaya 
Rail Solutions and not with Siyaya Consulting 
Engineers, the company which is the subject of the 
Commission of Inquiry.  Accordingly, they say that it 
is not clear why their client has been called to 
testify about the affairs of Siyaya which has no link 
with the company which is the subject of the 
inquiry.  In the circumstances it would, in my view, 
be appropriate to have the contents of the aforesaid 
letter 
raised 
before 
the 
Commission 
when 
it 
20 
commences.” 
Chairperson will see later on that there were some claims 
which were not settled.  One, if I remember was because it 
was not part of the liquidation inquiry of insolvency inquiry 
and the other one that was not settled was because there 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 45 of 127 
 
were outstanding issues that could not be resolved and I 
think it is a claim that involved the witnesses that I said 
were not longer at PRASA, Mr Montana and Mr [indistinct] 
26.28 and I think, so that claim was not settled for the 
simple 
reason 
that 
there 
were 
issues 
that 
no 
one…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see 30 minutes has expired but I will 
allow you a bit more time to continue and then I will start 
your questions. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Chairperson, do you intend to 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I will allow you to …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Do you intend to adjourn what 
time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would like us to continue and see how 
far we have gone by seven but I think we will not leave 
before seven so we might go to eight. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
Because 
this, 
Chairperson, 
although I said the issues I diverted from that statement, 
we deal with the evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, when I ask you questions some of 
the issues you will be able to deal with. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 46 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I will let you continue now for 
another ten minutes.   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So that is Mr Baltac and I – the 
next one is – I think he testifies again somewhere but 
maybe the best place where I can tell Chairperson for 
certainty is when I read some of – maybe let us go to page 
35. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are looking at the red numbers? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The red number, that is the… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   That is Mr Babuwe(?) 28.49. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is page 72 on the black numbers, 
35 on the red numbers, yes.  You want to draw to my 
attention there? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The evidence of Mr Babuwe is 
paragraph 5.4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   We sat with this witness for a very 
long time trying to unpack the issues here and if Chair can 
allow me, I will deal with it in my statement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So maybe I can leave this for now, 
the report, but the next document that Mr Botes brought 
was page 39 which is the correspondence or email 
communication between him and Mr Madimpi where they 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 47 of 127 
 
were reminding each other about what happened at the 
inquiry and I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what page is that? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is page – the red number is 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, continue? 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
The 
email 
of 
this 
page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is an email from Mr Botes to Mr 
Mogashoa who was the – Mr Botes was counsel for the 
liquidators and Mr Mogashoa was PRASA’s attorney.  What 
10 
do you want to draw to my attention in that email? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   This – firstly, in my answer to his 
statement I said he is actually – Mr Botes is actually – was 
actually the one who was persistent that the claims must 
be settled because even before I went the parties were 
discussing that look, there is nothing more to go to 
arbitration for.  This email is 6 September and he was 
actually just telling Mr Mogashoa and he was reminding 
him about the evidence of the witnesses, all the witnesses 
and also that he broke down the amount and in page 42 he 
20 
was telling Mr Madimpi not to play cat and mouse because 
there was nothing more to discuss and in the last 
paragraph he was saying: 
“In the event that we are successful to settle some 
of the claims we should continue with the arbitration 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 48 of 127 
 
only in respect of the remainder of the claims which 
are still in dispute and then he confirms the 
arbitrator ’s availability.” 
That email is dated 6 September 2017 is the point you said 
to 
make 
that 
even 
prior 
to 
your 
appointment 
as 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
PRASA 
board 
there 
were 
some 
communications between the legal team of the Siyaya 
Group or the liquidators and PRASA’s lawyers, is that the 
point you want to make? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes.  That obviously the PRASA 
10 
lawyers were saying they will revert to you but then Siyaya 
people were saying but you had your witnesses, what 
more?  Let us try to separate.  Where the issues cannot be 
settled we then go to arbitration knowing that we are only 
going in respect of where there is still disputes but where 
there are no disputes, for example, with the evidence of 
the witnesses that I will refer to, why are we still going on 
an arbitration?  This was even before I went to PRASA.  
Those emails are September 2017.  I think page 43 is the 
email of Mogashoa to Mr Botes, 5 September 2017, he 
20 
says: 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says: 
“I trust that we are on the same page now and that 
you will obtain proper and meaningful instruction 
from your client to dispose of all the outstanding 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 49 of 127 
 
issues in an effective and expeditious manner.  We 
should not be seen to drag our feet and to play for 
time at our client’s expense.  We are duly bound to 
act in a responsible and diligent manner.  We 
should 
therefore 
display 
leadership 
and 
act 
proactively in resolving these disputes.” 
Is that the part you want to emphasise? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, that is the conclusion of Mr 
Botes but I wanted to highlight and earlier email of Mr 
Mogashoa where he was – they were basically talking 
10 
about the readiness of the arbitration and whether it should 
be postponed or not.  This was an email that Mr Botes was 
referring to.  Actually, he was just saying there is no need 
to even be talking postponements and readiness, why do 
we not settle because already – separate the issues, where 
there are disputes, we can go on arbitration on disputes.  I 
am trying to see page 45.  I see it has my name but it is 
just something – I do not know what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I am going to help you now but if 
you have a last point to make, make it and then I can ask 
20 
you questions.  Some of my questions will touch on some 
of the matters that you may have wanted to deal with. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Then after – the point that I want 
to make before I get to the gist of the issues between me 
and Ms Ngoyi is that they – I saw in Mr Dingiswayo’s 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 50 of 127 
 
statement he says when I arrived at PRASA the first thing I 
asked about was this Siyaya matter and that is not true, 
Chairperson.  My evidence in my sworn statement and as I 
am talking to you now, that is not true.  I met them before 
– even before Mr Botes came into the picture with the 
Siyaya matter.  I spoke to them after the board came back 
from 
parliament 
where 
parliament 
had 
put 
us 
under 
pressure to give answers about the investigations that had 
been carried out at PRASA and a status.  So as part of 
consultation – and I think Ms Ngoyi refers to it in her 
10 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Ms Ngoyi refers – does not say that 
in the first meeting that you had with here, which Mr 
Dingiswayo I think attended. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does not say that you raised the issue 
of the Siyaya claims. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says – she says you raised them in 
the next meeting. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   In the next meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So between her and Mr Dingiswayo 
there is no consistency but the point, Chairperson, is when 
I met the two, these two legal officials, it was just a 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 51 of 127 
 
general discussion about issues in PRASA, the issues – 
everybody knows about the controversies at PRASA and 
the parliamentary portfolio committee had asked the board 
to give a report about the AG’s report, the irregularities 
which were specifically directed to report about things like 
the appointment of – I call them Werksmans but I 
understand it is not the correct pronunciation, it is 
Werksmans but I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there are lots of people, including 
me, who are not always sure whether it is Werksmans or 
10 
Werksmans. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, apparently the correct one is 
Werksmans.  So they were various reports about the 
appointment Werksmans which we were directed to take 
up, just first go to PRASA and start sniffing around about 
Siyaya.  We discussed about issues and we had a collegial 
discussion, I was meeting them for the first time. We were 
asking them who they are, Ms Ngoyi, why her surname is 
spelt with an e at the end, she confirmed that no, indeed, I 
am from – I am a descent of Lillian Ngoyi and she told me 
20 
how they came about to spell …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure it is Home Affairs. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, so – and also Mr Dingiswayo.  
You know, we reminisced about those issues, that both of 
them are from great or well-known in the history of South 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 52 of 127 
 
Africa and we had no issues, we were happy that we are 
going to work together in peace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the first meeting. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   That is in our first meeting, even 
before Mr Botes came there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think the first meeting was… 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I think it is on the 9 November.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think ja, it was on – I think Ms Ngoyi 
says it was on the 9 November. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Let me confirm with my records.  
10 
Yes, it is here a date 9 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the second one was on the 14 t h. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   9/11/’17 at PRASA, Martha Ngoyi, 
Fani Dingiswayo and then we were also with the then 
acting Group Chief Executive Officer.  My notes here says 
we talked about the appointment of Werksmans, what they 
should give the board with regard to the appointment of 
Werksmans and then discussions.  We talked about how 
Werksmans was appointed, according to them.  We talked 
about the report of the Public Protector as well as the 
20 
report of Makhubele and Huntley and we were to continue 
our discussion.   
There was no mention of Siyaya because even me, I 
did not know anything about that at the time.  And then we 
adjourned our meeting, that we will have a follow-up 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 53 of 127 
 
meeting.  The second meeting is on that date when after 
Mr Botes came then I called them again because I was 
sitting with the Group CEO.  Then we discussed the report 
that I have just – that we were just reading, Chairperson, 
and in my statement, I mention – or not statement, in my 
memo I mention that Ms Ngoyi appeared to have a faint 
idea about the insolvency inquiry.  So, Chairperson, that is 
my first encounter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Then maybe I can stop here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But I will elaborate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us go back and start a little 
earlier. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before your appointment as Chairperson 
of the PRASA board you had been practicing as advocate 
since 1999, is that right? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and in October of 2017 you were 
20 
interviewed 
by 
the 
Judicial 
Service 
Commission 
for 
appointment as a judge, is that right? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the interview on the 4 t h or what was 
it?  Are you able to remember the actual date? 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 54 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I cannot remember …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Early in October. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I cannot remember offhand but it is 
usually first week of October. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is usually first week of October. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Should be maybe …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it was first week of October. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   3 or 4 or 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now you had been nominated for 
appointment as a judge as far back before October was ell.  
10 
In other words, when were you nominated or when did you 
put in your nomination documents?  Would it have been 
around July? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I think the closing date was maybe 
July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe around July. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Maybe around July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  I take it that at that stage you 
had made up your mind that you wanted to go to the bench, 
if you could be appointed to the bench, is that right? 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and then you had the interview, I 
think it was on the 4 t h if I am not mistaken, of October from 
what I have read. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   3 or 4 that…[intervenes] 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 55 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, now you were recommended for 
appointment, the JSC recommended that you be appointed 
as a Judge.  Is that right? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when did you get to know that that 
would be their recommendation, was it like a day after your 
interview or a few days after the interview? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is normally, no it is normally not 
days, it would be maybe, it would be the next day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would be the next day as well. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It does not take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is my experience as well that 
either hear on the same day of the interview, or you get 
told the following day. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It does not take long, so it can be at 
least by the beginning of the following week after the 
interviews you knew that you had been recommended for 
appointment. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And at what stage had you been 
approached for possible appointment as a Director of the 
PRASA Board?  When you went to the interviews had you 
already been approached or not yet?    
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It must have been – I am trying to 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 56 of 127 
 
think about the date, because I have these things in my – I 
have already drafted some statement to respond to this at 
some forum where remember they do...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Remember the JCC...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   At the JCC. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The JCC is already...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Has had a meeting with you. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is actually considering that very 
issue…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The position, that they is asking 
me or where are you are going to…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Or why did I go to PRASA when I 
had already been nominated to practice…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   For the bench. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   My answer Chair…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Is I will give the date in – I will – I 
will reduce that statement into a sworn affidavit, if I – the 
reason I did not…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t speak far from the mic. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 57 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because when you speak – when you 
are a distance away, I cannot hear you. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The applications to the JSC are 
closed, maybe four months before the interviews and my 
recollections is the approach to serve in the PRASA board 
was in September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was in September?   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Was in September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, was in September and 
definitely before the interview, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And who approached you for possible 
appointment to the board? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   There is a neighbour of mine who 
obviously 
if 
you 
know 
each 
other 
you 
hear 
about 
opportunities and then you – even amongst circle of friends 
or even families.  So it was a neighbour he said there is a 
– he heard the Minister of Transport would be constituting 
interim or temporary boards because his under pressure.   
20 
          I think there was some court applications for the 
Minister 
to 
constitute 
permanent 
boards. 
 
But 
then 
apparently, he wanted to constitute interim boards when he 
was in the process of constituting permanent boards and 
then I then said look I have already decided that I no 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 58 of 127 
 
longer want to practice.  I want to go to the bench, I have 
submitted an application and if I am successful I will – 
between this and the bench I will choose a bench.   
          So he said anyway give me your CV, then I- I then 
gave him my CV.  I will – if Chairperson wants this 
communication because it was SMS to me…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I will give it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no, that’s fine that may be helpful 
or maybe you can include it in your bundle.  
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I will include it in my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So I gave him my CV and definitely 
before the JSC interview and then we forgot about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are you able to give the name of 
the neighbour? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is Mr Chauke.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Chauke? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Chauke, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and what is the name? 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   His name is Richard.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Richard? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Richard, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Richard Chauke.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   He is a Doctor now, you can call 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 59 of 127 
 
him Doctor.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that a medical Doctor, academic 
Doctor? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   No, the learned Doctor, there is a 
– he is not a medical Doctor. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay he has a doctorate.   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   He has a doctorate, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I understand those are the real 
Doctors.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I am sure the medical Doctors will 
contest that…[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I mean for the title Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh for the title, oh okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The title belongs to those who 
have a PhD, I am told.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The medical ones it is a job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I am not saying anything I am just 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes so I will give you the trail of 
that correspondence between then two of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay that will be helpful, yes.  
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 60 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So when – then I went for an 
interview and we did not talk again about my CV. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But what I understood and what he 
said in return to the communication that I submitted my CV 
was that he was going to forward it to the department.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And I did not hear anything from 
any one and I did not until – I think on that day it was 
maybe 23 or 19 October then I just heard people saying my 
10 
name was mentioned on television when they made cabinet 
announcement that I have been appointed in the PRASA 
interim board control.   
          The cabinet has endorsed the names and thereafter 
then I received the call from the department.  Then I 
indicated that – for how long is this appointment because 
one other thing Chairperson before you – maybe that will 
be your next question.  I do not want to – I am not 
anticipating your questions but because this issue has 
been raised…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has been, yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So I know the issues there 
concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So, I am not anticipating. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 61 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no that is fine address it yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, before I went to the interview, 
before 
I 
even 
submitted 
my 
application 
for 
judicial 
appointment, I had spoken to the JP and…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Judge, President Mlambo?  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Mlambo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And then in the course of our 
discussions obviously is to establish your readiness and I 
think I did mention in my interview that he is the one who 
10 
was persistent that I must apply, I must join there because 
I have been acting a lot.  Then I – before I then said to JP 
at that time, I was holding the position of Chairperson of 
the Water Tribunal that if I am appointed, I will have to 
give notice to the Minister of Transport not transport of 
water and sanitation because I cannot simply leave.   
          Then there is a stage where the Water Tribunal 
collapsed because the Chairperson left for a judicial 
appointment 
without 
duties 
and 
then 
when 
we 
were 
appointed obviously, we re-established the tribunal.  So I 
20 
said I will at least want to give notice of about three 
months.  So I was very clear from the beginning that when 
I get the appointment I am not – I will first have to be give 
notice 
from 
the 
Water 
Tribunal 
and 
that 
was 
our 
understanding.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 62 of 127 
 
          So when I accepted to serve in the interim board of 
PRASA it was on that basis that anyway I have time that 
when I am finalising my work other than the Water Tribunal 
there were other matters that had been sat down went into 
November and some into February and March of 2018.  So 
that this thing will fall within that – because I was told it is 
a – it was going to be the Minister was given four months 
to constitute a permanent board.   
          So people are always asking where does this date 
of 1 April come from because that is the date, I had 
10 
indicated that I will be ready to start with my judicial 
appointment Chairperson, so that is how it went.  So when 
the announcements that the President has approved the 
recommendations that came after – I was already at 
PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry just repeat the sentence I did 
not hear it. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   When the President made the 
appointments…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay to appoint you as a Judge. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I was already at PRASA, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because you were appointed as 
Chairperson of PRASA…[intervenes] 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 63 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   19 October…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 19 t h of October. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the announcement of the decision of 
the President in terms of appointing various Judges, new 
Judges it seems it was made on the 2 n d of November or it 
is early November.  Is that your recollection? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is early November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is early November. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I was already at PRASA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were already at PRASA. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I was already at PRASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So then when that announcement 
was made then that we all starting on the 1 s t of January.  
Then I again engaged the Judge President…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You what? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Then I engaged the Judge 
President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Mlambo about it.  I will provide 
Chairperson with – because I mean that is no longer a 
secret everything must be – whatever is available we have 
to provide.  I will provide our communication because I was 
expecting that my appointment would have a date of 1 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 64 of 127 
 
April. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Not 1 January.  So JP even before 
the President signed the letters of appointment, he issued 
a notice for the recommended candidates of which I was 
one.  His – the directive was telling us that he was 
congratulating us for even been recommended and saying 
that 
usually 
from 
here 
the 
President 
will 
sign 
the 
certificate.   
          He has asked him to sign for the 1 s t of January but 
10 
usually the President will take time but even if he takes 
time the appointment gets backdated to the date that he 
has given me and he also was explaining some other 
logistics, appointment logistics.  And I immediately wrote 
to JP by return email to say well I accept that you want to 
place me in Pretoria and asked other questions and then I 
said but JP with regard to the date can I have a discussion 
with you.   
          If you remember we had a discussion I want to meet 
with you with regard to the effective date and remember 
20 
Chair by then the President had not yet signed, then 
according to that letter.  So JP said to me in reply Nana I 
am busy put your thoughts about the effective dates in 
writing, which I did by return mail to him to say JP you 
remember we agreed that I want to start on the 1 s t of April 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 65 of 127 
 
for these reasons.   
 
And then we further exchanges between us and 
apparently in between maybe because of my delay in 
responding to him because in one email he said I 
responded late the President has already put the date of 1 
April.  And then we had further meetings with the JP and 
until we came to the understanding that he will engage the 
Minister of Justice to ask the President to change that date 
to as I had requested.   
          And obviously I had to ask JP but JP why did you 
10 
not give the President from the beginning a date?  And 
then his reply was that no he received many requests and 
they…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t move away from the mic. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Many requests and then he wanted 
- I don’t know what he - but the long and the short of it was 
that he did not communicate that date to the President at 
that time when he made that submission and that is the 
story Chairperson.  Yes, I will provide the documents that I 
am referring to from the…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we - the commission does have 
some correspondence from the JP and it is not in the 
bundle I think because it came recently.  We asked the JP 
for the letter asking for recommending a deferment of your 
appointment to say it must be at a later dates but we have 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 66 of 127 
 
got 
that 
letter 
and 
then 
we’ve 
got 
a 
letter 
from 
UniteBehind, I think if I am not mistaken that UniteBehind 
may have written – I don’t know whether to you or to the JP 
about their concerns in regard to you and PRASA.   
          There maybe a letter that you either wrote to the JP 
or wrote to UniteBehind but we wanted to see the letter 
that went to either the Minister or the President as your 
appointment must be deferred. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, I have that correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have got that correspondence? 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I have that correspondence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Because immediately UniteBehind 
started writing to JP Mlambo in – end of January 2018, 
towards end of January they said there is a Judge – one of 
your Judges is a PRASA and according to the court roll we 
see she is also sitting in court.  A Judge cannot hold dual 
positions and I think that is when they engaged with JP and 
he responded to say no she has asked to start 1 April.   
          I have already asked the Minister to ask the 
20 
President to do this December.  That is where it starts.  I 
have 
the 
correspondence 
the 
first 
and 
even 
the 
correspondence that JP sent to the Minister subsequent to 
that.  I also have – because a legal controversy developed, 
the controversy was whether that date of 1 April can simply 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 67 of 127 
 
be changed.   
          And then – by then President Zuma was gone it was 
President Ramaphosa. So the legal, the State Legal 
Advisors sort an opinion which President Ramaphosa 
wanted whether he lawfully, he can grant that change.  I 
have that opinion because it concerns me, they provided 
me with that opinion and I did not even start on 1 April 
because now the controversy grew bigger and bigger and 
bigger and then the President wanted to make sure that 
before he changes that date.   
10 
          So I stayed home I am no longer at PRASA because 
I resigned at PRASA.  I am no longer at PRASA, I am no 
longer practising as an Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you stop practising as an 
Advocate? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I – on the 13 t h – end of March.  
CHAIRPERSON:   End of March 2018, 2018? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   2018, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Because I was still even appearing 
20 
in court and I am also doing Water Tribunal work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
So 
I 
am 
- 
my 
effective 
date…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we – after we got the JP’s letter or 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 68 of 127 
 
correspondence and we saw that what was said to the 
Minister as the reason for the deferment was, I think the 
work at Water Tribunal the commission. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They made contact with the Water 
Tribunal about the work that was to be done as well. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said there was some work to be 
done there. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   There was I did some sittings at 
10 
the Water Tribunal in the month of February and I have – I 
will give you a copy of my letter of resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But there was work that I was 
doing at the Water Tribunal on specific dates which I will 
provide you with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now the – if I recall correctly the 
correspondence I saw seems to suggest that there was 
appeal which had been heard on a number of days up to 
the end of 2017 but the judgment had been reserved and it 
20 
was handed down later at some stage in 2018, I think mid-
2018.  But in terms of sittings the correspondence 
suggested that the sittings were only in 2017.  Would that 
be your recollection? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   No, I will give Chairperson the 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 69 of 127 
 
details…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you will give a full account of what 
was there. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, I will give you a full account 
of what was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And which sat on which dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And when the controversies arose 
because it was clear that I was not going to be working as 
10 
Judge on the 1 s t of April.  I then asked JP, JP and Minister 
Masutha I was writing to them to say please tell me am I 
still going to be a Judge or can I just forget about this and 
go back to practice because JP’s position was that we 
cannot 
risk 
putting 
me 
on 
the 
bench 
before 
that 
controversy was resolved and I remembered I had been – 
the JP Ditaba had put me in the recess role of April of 
2018.   
          But 
JP 
Mlambo 
said 
no 
I 
cannot 
until 
that 
controversy is resolved because the risk of that certificate 
20 
of appointment which we do not know whether it is valid or 
not until we here from the President.  And he cannot 
appoint me to sit on the bench on an acting basis.  So I did 
nothing in April, I did nothing in May and mid-May then 
President Ramaphosa made a decision.  I do not know if 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 70 of 127 
 
Chairperson has copies of the decisions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I have seen at least; I don’t know 
if it is a letter from the Minister saying the President made 
a decision which I understand it to be – the effects to 
which I understand to be that you were going to start on 
the 1 s t of June or you have been appointed with effect from 
the 1 s t of June.   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, it is a little confusing 
because you had already been appointed with effect from 
10 
the 1 s t of January. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, but…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then now the letter says you are 
being appointed like again with effect from 1 s t of June, I 
found it a little bit confusing. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   There may be what Chairperson 
missed is the proclamation by the President.  There is a 
proclamation that say…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The presidential minutes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   The presidential minutes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   That says I had previously 
appointed you with effect from 1 January and now I am 
changing that date to 1 June and then there is the 
appointment certificate.  So that is what I am saying that 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 71 of 127 
 
you maybe did not see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now the letter that was written by 
the Judge President to the Minister about the deferment of 
your appointment certainly says in effect it is because of 
your work as in the Water Tribunal that you were seeking 
the deferment.  Is that correct? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I don’t think it says so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh maybe I should ask what is the 
reason that made you ask for the deferment? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I have not seen; I have not seen 
10 
that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I said when I asked to defer it was 
to finalise my work.  I still had matters set down up to the 
beginning of the next year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And secondly it was to resign from 
the Water Tribunal and give notice until 31 March and I 
said the PRASA issue is something that happened because 
I want to make it clear Chairperson I did not – Jake 
20 
Mlambo did not give me permission to go to PRASA.  No, 
he did not.  I already said that when they said the 
appointment will not be longer than four months, I said I 
can do this because anyway I have time.   
          So it was on economic decision like I was still 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 72 of 127 
 
practising – going to court doing everything that an 
independent legal practitioner could do.  So when the 
opportunity came, I said I can do this and then it will be 
finished before my due date to start with the…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I saw in a – I think your statement or 
letter to the bar counsel in relation to your complaint 
against Mr Botes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I saw that you indicated that you had 
asked for the deferment of your appointment in order to 
10 
wrap up your practice…[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   My practice, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I have it here with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think I did see there something to 
that effect.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Paragraph 1, I say I was a member 
of Pretoria society…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will not be…[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I resigned from membership of the 
20 
bar 
with 
a 
view 
to 
prepare 
for 
taking 
up 
judicial 
appointment.  My appointment would have been with effect 
from 1 January however I requested an indulgence of four 
months to wrap up my legal practice.  So it was – I just 
generalised here. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 73 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So and then I say I would have 
commenced duties on 1 April but the date was amended to 
1 June 2018.  I took office as a Judge on 8 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well part of the concern I have is that in 
the letter to the Minister asking for the deferment the reason 
that is mentioned and I assume that the JP mentioned it 
because that is what came from you was your Water Tribunal 
commitments.  But in this statement, it says it is wrapping up 
your legal practice and about … 
10 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
Have 
not 
seen 
that 
letter 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no it… 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I cannot comment on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But – but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  The request that I made. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Was to wrap up my legal practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your legal practice. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Indeed, the Water Tribunal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 74 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  That is part of my legal practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So I – I do not see the contradiction 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you saw – you see it as  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Water Tribunal is part of your practice. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I was – I was appointed when whilst 
10 
– I was not a fulltime – it was not a fulltime job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It is a – it is a – Chairpersonship 
where you are called to adjudicate matters as and when 
there are matters.  And it is – and whilst you are doing any 
other work that comes your way as a legal practitioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so you say after and I think you said 
you resigned from the bar with effect from the end of 
20 
November, is it right? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you continued practicing. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Membership. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After – membership of the bar. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 75 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Because you can – you can practice 
as an advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  In your house or anywhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understand that. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But membership of the bar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had resigned ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of your practice. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You continued ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage you were no longer keeping 
chambers. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
No 
I 
was 
no 
longer 
keeping 
chambers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were practicing from home. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I was practicing from home. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  From home. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, I guess you must have had 
quite some work because if you defer your appointment as a 
Judge from 1 January to up to end of March it means you 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 76 of 127 
 
would be forfeiting three months’ salary as a Judge.  So your 
practice must have been ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well compared to – compared to the 
matters that I had I had already scheduled – I – it was worth 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was worth it. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It was worth it because I had – I had 
court hearings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had court hearings. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
I 
had 
court 
hearing 
even 
in 
10 
Polokwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  High court Pretoria I was still 
consulting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And the Tribunal paid per sitting and 
this Chairperson they are – there is administrative work that 
precede sittings because you are the one allocating matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  You are the one allocation means 
20 
you must have read the files and everything.  So it was – 
and it was really not about money it was about putting my – 
my life in order that I want to close this chapter.  I still have 
matters.  I still have accounts to render and I – I must do 
this let me – let me defend my appointment. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 77 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So I – yes I forfeited Judge’s salary 
for not just those three months but because the appointment 
was delayed further for five months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And of course, when you… 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  It was no longer my choice I was 
simply not in a position because I could not now assume 
duties because they – I was told the certificate must first be 
changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now tell me in regard to your position as 
10 
Chairperson of the Water Tribunal. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the notice period you were 
required to give?  Was it three months or in terms of the law 
or what was the notice? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  There is no – there is no specified 
notice period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no specified period. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I – I chose to give that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Because I – there were a lot of – 
there were a lot of outstanding matters Chairperson and as I 
said I did not want to disrupt the Tribunal because if there is 
no Chairperson there is no Tribunal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 78 of 127 
 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And at that time there was even – 
when it became – when it almost happened that on the 30 – 
maybe it was the end of March when I realised that this thing 
of changing the appointment date is – may not happen soon.  
I even considered withdrawing my resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  At the Water Tribunal because I – I 
wanted to – to go back to practice and I – I think there was a 
– there was that attempt to withdraw.  I was no longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I felt let me go back and withdraw my 
resignation and forget about this judicial appointment. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the interview in the JSC they asked you 
when you would be available to commence duties as a judge 
if you are appointed. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not ask you about that? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  No.  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  When I have – I have seen again I 
am not pre-empting your questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  But because Judge Tuchten – you 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 79 of 127 
 
know he wrote the judgment and then he – he mentions in 
his judgement that – did she consider the fact – some facts 
from the JCC was there something she should have told the 
JCC definitely no-one asked me anything.  I mean the record 
is – can be accessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  There were no questions that when 
are you available?  Can you start tomorrow, next week or 
when?  And my understanding Chairperson and you should 
know and it – and it is a fact that can be established that 
10 
there are – there are judges who - who asked and were given 
much longer than three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  So it was not – it is not – there is 
nothing untoward about someone asking to defer their 
appointment.  It has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And there is nothing as far as I know 
there is no rule that you – you cannot ask.  There is no rule 
that once you are recommended there is a specific date that 
20 
you must start in and in my interactions with the Department 
of Justice because we had a lot of interactions and I will 
mention it in my statement and also refer to the people that I 
was consulting with.  The logistics of the appointment I – are 
with the Head of a court because he knows when he needs 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 80 of 127 
 
capacity, and even we attend the same interviews Eastern 
Cape the judges would be required to start a month earlier 
and in another division maybe a different date and my 
understanding is the JP gives the Minister a date that I want 
my appointees to commence on this date.  And – and from 
there it becomes – it becomes an employment issue that is 
the information I received that in reality the – the people 
doing the logistics of the appointment should be asking you, 
here is – when do want to start?  And then you say, no I want 
to start next when, when and then you sign the – forms be 
10 
signed or salary for the declarations of interest and all those 
things.  For my understanding from the information that has 
been provided to me is that that is allowed and until now I do 
not know maybe the JCC – the JSC may want to – to do 
something about it and – because we are not behind as – 
has 
gone 
as 
far 
as 
to 
suggest 
that 
once 
you 
are 
recommended it means you – your economic activity starts.  
But they forget that the recommendation as Chair is already 
set.  It is only after the interview and the effective date of 
the appointment would be two months later even if one were 
20 
to take that appointment.  But then who is going to support 
you in-between? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I certainly know that there have been 
occasions when persons who have been recommended for 
appointment as judges did not start or took quite some time 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 81 of 127 
 
before they started or before their appointments took effect.  
And I understand that some of them raised those issues in 
the JSC to say, although I have made myself available, I 
want to say that I will not be able to start like within the time 
that it normally happens.  I will – I will talk to the Head of 
court because I could – I might want to make an arrangement 
for – for my practice.  There have been those instances but I 
do not know the details in regard to all of them.  I just do 
know that there are some of those instances. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes Chairperson.  And the other 
10 
thing is I am not aware of any prohibition that whilst you 
under recommendation – let me put it that you are under 
recommendation the kind of work you can or cannot do.  I 
agree…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see … 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I really do not know because it was 
stretched to say I could – I should not have gone to PRASA. 
But what should I have done?  No-one told me that you are 
now limited to do this.  If you have you cannot do that.  I  am 
not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I am not aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see Judge Makhubele part of what 
makes your case strange at least to me. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 82 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I – I am putting this to you so that you 
can address it.  Is that here is somebody who – who wants to 
be a judge.  She has gone to an interview with the Judicial 
Service Commission.  She knows that she has been 
recommended for appointment as a Judge.  She knows about 
her recommendation early in October and around 19 October 
she allows herself to be appointed as Chairperson of an 
SOE.  It could have been maybe a private company but an 
SOE.  In circumstances where she knows that in all 
probability she is going to be appointed. 
10 
 
Because I think we both know that once the judicial 
service commission has recommended to... actually, the 
Constitution says... has advised the president to appoint 
you, almost invariably the president will appoint you, you 
know.   
 
There may be one or two cases that I am aware of where 
there was some queries but I do not remember anybody over 
the years who in respect of whom any president was advised 
to appoint... to make an appointment and did not accept the 
advice. 
20 
 
So you are dealing with the situation where you are 
almost sure that you are going to be appointed.  You go to 
the bench.   
 
It is towards the end of the year.  It is maybe reasonable 
to think that your expectation would be that you would start 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 83 of 127 
 
early in the new year. 
 
So then the question arises, but why is she taking this 
PRASA 
appointed? 
 
Why 
is 
she 
taking 
on 
new 
responsibilities when she knows she is due soon to start her 
functions, her duties as a judge? 
 
Why is she taking on more responsibilities instead of 
reducing her responsibilities in preparation for going to the 
bench? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, Chairperson.  The problem with 
that analyses is that there is an attempt to link the two 
10 
scenarios.  The non-taking up of the appointment and having 
gone to PRASA...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, not wanting to take on ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Then there is a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...the judicial appointment but wanting to 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  There was a ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...take on a non-judicial appointment.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  There is an ulterior motive which is 
what is being... I do not know if... I can only explain what I 
20 
am explaining.  And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Then the complainants will be saying, 
“Yes, the reason she did not is because she wanted to go 
and commit this irregularity at PRASA”.  But if you can 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 84 of 127 
 
separate the two issues, then you will see that they are not... 
they would not necessarily be linked. 
 
Because suppose I had gone to PRASA and then under 
similar circumstances and I come out without any allegation 
of wrongdoing, there would not be any controversy about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, to me it... there will still be 
something strange about taking the PRASA job. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because as I say, when you... you know 
you have been recommended for appointment as a judge and 
10 
you know that soon you will be expected to commence your 
duties as a judge, one would expect you to begin to wrap up 
because you know you are soon going to be starting as a 
judge. 
 
One would not be expecting you to take on more 
responsibilities.  That is point one.  Point two, these 
responsibilities... these are... this was a position that would 
be seen as not consistent with being a judge to say but this 
person wants to be a judge.   
 
She has made her choice.  She wants to be a judge.  
20 
She knows she has been recommended.  In due course she 
must start working as a judge.  Why is she adding on another 
responsibility that has got nothing to do with your function? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Well, Chair.  I am ready to answer to 
any suggestions that may be put as the reasons before I 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 85 of 127 
 
can... if I have to dispute the suggestions.  But I have 
already given my... how it happened. 
 
You know you... Chairperson, you are sitting there with 
the hindsight ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but I just want you to address  
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  You are setting there with hindsight, 
questioning the motives of someone who says it happened 
because I had time.  I was... I had time until end of March as 
far as I am concerned.   
10 
 
And that in the period, there was nothing to prevent me 
to have taken up the appointment.  You know if the 
suggestion or if what was being put to me was to say you 
know there is a prohibition that you cannot do this, then I will 
start to begin to say... to want to justify to say I did not 
know. 
 
But I am saying, as far as I am concerned or as far as I 
knew, there was no prohibition and I did that out of a need.  
And I am telling you that I was still adjudicating matters at 
the Water Tribunal.  It was not a full-time job.  It was on a 
20 
holding basis.   
 
And same with PRASA.  It was not a full-time job.  It 
was... I am already in this tribunal and board.  For me it 
would sound the same that even there I would go when I am 
needed.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 86 of 127 
 
 
There are meetings, schedules of meetings that we are 
given, and then that other side, there is also schedule and 
then there are court hearings which are also scheduled.   
 
And I did not see any... besides not seeing any conflict, I 
did not deem it as a job that Chairperson would call a huge 
responsibility.   
 
And I will tell you again, I am not anticipating the 
questions because I know the questions have been asked by 
everyone. 
 
Even at the JCC, there is a ruling that chief justice and 
10 
his committee have already made that of all the cases at 
PRASA, she concentrated on the Siyaya matter. 
 
And I am not... I am going to prove that I did not 
concentrate on Siyaya matters.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  And I... maybe not to you, but I am 
ready to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, but I am going there but let us 
deal with this first.  I am going there. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I am going to prove that we did a lot 
20 
at PRASA and I will be happy to share what we did with you 
so that you can see that there was nothing strenuous about 
it.  I carried it and I also carried what I had to carry at the 
Water Tribunal and also in court. 
 
So I will... so I am ready to answer that question that... 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 87 of 127 
 
other than Siyaya, what did you do.  Chairperson, if you want 
to get to it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no.  I think we... but let us 
finish on this.  I am surprised that you say that you did not 
see your position as chairperson of the PRASA Board as a 
position that came with huge responsibilities. 
 
I am surprised by that because my own understanding is 
that indeed any position of chairperson of a board of any of 
these SOE’s comes with a lot of responsibilities but also 
...[intervenes]  
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Chairperson, can I correct you?  I did 
not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, before that.  I will give you a chance. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Also, purely from what one has been 
hearing about PRASA in the public domain even before this 
Commission, the allegations of corruption and what is 
happening there. 
 
And of course, I have had some evidence within the 
Commission, but even in the years, some years back in the 
20 
public domain, it was quite clear that there were lots of 
allegations of corruption at PRASA. 
 
And also, you may or may not be aware that your 
predecessor in that position, Mr Popo Molefe, has testified in 
this Commission.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 88 of 127 
 
 
May understanding of his testimony is that as a board 
they had a lot of work to do.  So my impression is that there 
was quite of work.  It was a lot of responsibility.   
 
That is why I am saying that I am surprised that you... 
your evidence seems to be that no it was not such a heavy 
job. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
Well, 
I... 
you 
did... 
you 
misunderstood me.  The word that we were using was 
strenuous.  And I said it was not a strenuous job.  I did a job 
very well and I will show you what we did. 
10 
 
Yes, there was a lot of work.  And I told you Chairperson 
that the second day of our appointment, we were called to 
parliament and we were given certain tasks to report and we 
had meetings. 
 
So I did not use the word there is no... it is no job.  I 
said it was not strenuous.  I was able to carry it.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so you do accept that the job came 
with a huge responsibility? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that is in part where my difficulty 
is, is namely that, here is somebody who should be winding 
down in order to be ready to take a new position as a judge 
soon but instead of winding down, she is taking on a new 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 89 of 127 
 
position with a huge responsibility.  That does not sound... 
that seems strange to me. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  If Chair can tell me how strange it is 
and maybe tell me what informs your ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...worry ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  ...once you know ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Because we have been [laughs] you 
have been on this and I cannot take it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Chair, we remain with that.  Chair will 
remain with the impression ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...that it is strange and I will 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
I 
cannot... 
in 
the 
absence 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot say anything more than what 
you have said, yes. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  ...in the absence of you telling me 
what you think informed my decision to enable me to deal 
with your thoughts, whether they are... it is just your 
thoughts or the evidence that has been led before you, I 
cannot take it any further. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 90 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Can I request?  I need to drink water 
Chair.  If you... if I can have an opportunity to just get my 
water and drink it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  A comfort break? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I have been talking for long now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us take a 15-minute comfort 
break.  I see it is quarter past seven.  So we come back at 
10 
half-past seven.  Then we will see how... 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...when we can adjourn. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will take an adjournment for 15-
minutes.  We will resume at half-past seven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is half past seven, we will adjourn at 
eight.  Yes, counsel and Judge. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Oh, sorry, I am going to start 
afresh.  The reason I asked what issues the Commission is 
investigating because I obviously need to know what I am 
supposed to respond to and yesterday I wrote a letter to 
Chairperson.  I am not saying you have seen it yet but you 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 91 of 127 
 
can just take note, it is 4 August 2020 where I requested 
certain information and part of that information that I 
requested was that I see the witnesses before you have 
attached the judgment of Judge Neil Tuchten and in that 
judgment he has made some adverse remarks about me 
and he has also – one of the issues that he is dealing with 
is the issue of why did I not – why, what did I possibly 
withheld certain information, what was I doing at PRASA 
and then he makes a recommendation that he is of the firm 
view that a platform should be created for me to answer 
10 
the questions that he has raised.  Some of the questions 
related to the allegations of the settlement of the claims 
but then again specific to the issues pertaining to my 
appointment as a judge and the very kind strange feelings 
that Chairperson says you have and then he says a 
platform must be presented – must be created to me.  So in 
the letter that I wrote to you, Chairperson, yesterday, I 
specifically …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have not seen that letter.  It might 
have – it might be on the way. 
20 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
I 
specifically 
asked 
if 
this 
Commission is that platform that Judge Tuchten has 
suggested must be created or what am I supposed to 
answer with regard to the judgment of Judge Tuchten which 
has attached to the witnesses’ statements, Chairperson.  
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 92 of 127 
 
So at this point my request is that I – and when we started, 
Chair said no, you are only dealing with the issues 
pertaining to the settlement of the claims and I took 
comfort in that but then now, Chairperson, he is asking me 
questions about …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I said the issues that we will deal 
with are those that are in the affidavits in this Commission 
and then I mentioned the settlement, which is one of them. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And actually, it occupies quite a big part 
10 
of what Ms Ngoyi and Mr Dingiswayo talks about.  One of 
the things that Ms Ngoyi raises is that – but the 
Chairperson of the PRASA board had been appointed as a 
judge.  Actually, when she took up the position, accepted 
the position of Chairperson of the board of PRASA she had 
already been recommended for appointment.  She raises 
those issues in her affidavit. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Well, she makes statements, she 
does not raise issues. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well 
she 
is 
saying 
in 
effect 
20 
…[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   It is just the statement, the person 
that calls it, it is Mr Achmat, in his statement and I think 
when we deal with his evidence, I expect to address what 
he means by my controversial appointment.   
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 93 of 127 
 
 
But then, the issue that I am saying, Chairperson, is 
in the letter that I have written, which you say you have not 
seen, maybe if Chair can see the letter first because I 
referred to the rules of the Commission.   
In terms of the rules of the Commission, if there are 
proceedings in any other forum that were conducted to be 
– so in this case, on this very same issues there is 
proceedings at the High Court in Pretoria before two 
judges, Holland-Müter and Tuchten.  There are proceedings 
before the JCC where I have already appeared and the 
10 
rule, Rule 6.5 says a witness – well, I am obliged and the 
other 
witnesses 
are 
obliged 
to 
bring 
those 
to 
your 
attention, those proceedings, to tell this, so that secretary 
can 
procure 
the 
transcripts 
in 
those 
proceedings, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So I – and which is what in I have 
– the heading of this section of my letter says:  Terms of 
Reference in PRASA Hearings because I, in all honesty, I 
need to know that what exactly am I supposed to respond it 
20 
to.  That is why I started by referring to the affidavit of Ms 
Ngoyi where she says the people, she is going to talk 
about are people against who had been found wanting.  
And I emphasise that I am not one of those persons, no 
one has ever found me wanting for anything [inaudible – 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 94 of 127 
 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me explain it to you so that we 
do not take too long on this. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You look at the terms of reference of the 
Commission, you will see that they include that the 
Commission must investigate State Capture and corruption 
and fraud in the Public Sector including organs of state.  
As I said earlier on, many people know that for years there 
have been all kinds of allegations of corruption at PRASA 
10 
and that have been in the public domain.   
 
Now the PRASA witnesses who have come forward 
have testified about allegations of corruption at PRASA, 
they have made certain allegations against the Siyaya 
companies in terms of corruption, they have made certain 
allegations 
against 
Mr 
Makhensa 
Mabunda, 
who 
I 
understand from Ms Ngoyi’s affidavit, controls the Siyaya 
group of companies and they say here is some things that 
happened here, somebody who had been interviewed for 
appointment as a judge and had been recommended for 
20 
appointment gets appointed to come to PRASA and she 
comes to PRASA as Chairperson of the board and she 
shows special interest in the settlement of Siyaya claims 
and they say, contrary what you say you will tell me and 
you said you will give details, they say there were many 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 95 of 127 
 
cases at PRASA but she only showed interest in the Siyaya 
ones.  They said there were many others, she just wanted 
Siyaya claims to be paid. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they say she sidelined the legal 
department of PRASA, that is people who have always 
been handling PRASA matters, legal matters internally and 
they 
say, 
according 
to 
Mr 
Mogashoa, 
she, 
 
this 
Chairperson,  tells Mr Mogashoa do not deal with the legal 
department of PRASA anymore and then they say the next 
10 
thing, these matters are settled and actually they say when 
you look at the so-called settlement, it is not settlement, it 
is capitulation by PRASA.  When you look at the amounts 
that the Chairperson said must be paid, it is exactly the 
amounts that are claimed by the Siyaya Group against 
PRASA, it is not a compromise or anything and she says 
we had to intervene when there was a new Minister of 
Transport, Dr Blade Nzimande, we had t approach him and 
say 
Minister, 
there 
is 
something 
wrong, 
there 
was 
something wrong happening, PRASA is about to lose about 
20 
I do not whether it is 59 million but a lot of millions 
because a settlement that the Chairperson has pushed 
through.  We are against it, please intervene and then they 
go to court and they say we succeeded ultimately to stop 
this.  They say the Chairperson had no authority to settle 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 96 of 127 
 
these matters, the authority was with the head of the legal 
department and they say we successfully prevented PRASA 
from losing a lot of money that PRASA was going to lose 
because of this Chairperson and they say since we 
succeeded the Siyaya companies have never pursued 
these claims, this arbitration that was supposed to go on.  
That is what they said. 
 
So this Commission is looking into that to see 
whether – exactly what happened. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Thank you, Chair, we will obviously 
10 
get to the other details.  You remember we just stopped 
where I had talked about the reports of the Commissioner 
and then we then came to – we spent maybe the last hour 
talking about my appointment.  But I am going to deny 
everything that they are saying.   
I am going to show you that I am never one person 
that takes shortcuts.  Even with the matter of Siyaya there 
is a - and I will deny that it is my decision and even with 
the Siyaya matter I always – or my board always involved 
the internal auditor.  I have request …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   internal auditor? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, in every issue that we were 
dealing with that was required, some – so there is – I will 
show you, Chairperson, and I think you have seen from my 
statement that my relationship with the legal team, not just 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 97 of 127 
 
my relationship, my board’s relationship with the two 
incumbents of the legal unit broke down, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did it break down? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because as I understand the position 
from Ms Ngoyi – and I may be misunderstanding her 
evidence but my impression is that you sidelined them 
when – you sidelined them and they were against the 
settlement of the Siyaya claims because they believed that 
PRASA has reasonable prospects of success and, as I 
10 
indicated earlier on, Mr Dingiswayo testified that he was 
told by Mr Mogashoa who was PRASA’s attorney that you 
had said the PRASA attorneys must not talk to the legal 
department at PRASA about the Siyaya claims. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Well, I will deal with it when I – I 
do not know what will happen first, maybe oral evidence or 
my statement, but I will deal with all that but what I am 
saying, Chairperson, is that maybe it is in that – in their 
oral evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it also in the affidavits. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   In the affidavit of Ms Ngoyi she 
mentions …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Ngoyi refers to it …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   In the last paragraph, yes, she 
mentions 
that, 
she 
says 
I 
may 
mention 
that 
the 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 98 of 127 
 
Chairperson had been recommended as a judge – but she 
does not make any conclusions why that is relevant, 
Chairperson, which is why I am asking …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Whether there is a witness who 
has given evidence to say that I went – let me not say 
whether because there is a witness, maybe we can talk 
about him, Mr Botes, Advocate Botes.  Advocate Botes is 
the only witness who …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us leave Advocate Botes for 
10 
now. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us come back to Ms Ngoyi and Mr 
Dingiswayo.  What do you say to Mr Dingiswayo’s evidence 
that he was told by Mr Mogashoa that you had told Mr 
Mogashoa not to discuss the Siyaya claims with the legal 
department and, of course, you will have seen in Mr 
Mogashoa’s affidavit that he confirms that that is true.  
What do you say about that? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I deny that, Chairperson, I never 
20 
told Mr Mogashoa not to communicate with the legal 
services and I think I mentioned in my – the problem is 
when there are multiple investigations you do not know 
where you mentioned the issue but I mentioned it that – 
because at the JCC the allegation is I terminated his 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 99 of 127 
 
mandate.  But in his own statement before you, Mr 
Mogashoa does not say that, he says his mandate – he 
explains 
who 
terminated 
his 
mandate 
under 
what 
circumstances. 
 
So I deny and I will deny.  Anyway, I do not even 
have to deal with whether I terminated his mandate or not 
because in his own words, I am not the one who terminated 
his mandate but the issue of communication with him, I 
never told anyone not to communicate with him and as you 
– it is being said, Chairperson, it is someone saying I was 
10 
told by someone that someone told someone that someone 
says this …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:    I never had any discussion of that 
nature with Mr Mogashoa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did have meetings with him. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But the sequence of event with 
regard to the communication, Chairperson, is there is an 
email that I took exception to.  Here is an executive is 
asked to explain something, to give information because it 
20 
is an information seeking question.  Can you tell me what 
happened here and here and here?  And then he takes that 
question to Mr Mogashoa to answer and I said there is an 
email to that effect.   
This question I wanted you to answer to me 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 100 of 127 
 
because before you go and ask outsiders you need to 
understand from within. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but I …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But that does not amount to me 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you are on another question now, I 
am still on the question of whether on your denial that you 
told Mr Mogashoa not to discuss the Siyaya claims with the 
legal team of – legal department of PRASA.   
Why would – it just seems strange that an attorney 
10 
who gets work from PRASA and who is working with the 
new Chairperson of the board of PRASA would say to 
somebody 
in 
the 
legal 
department 
of 
PRASA 
your 
Chairperson said I must not discuss these matters with you 
when in fact that is not so and when in fact he expects or 
wants to get more work from this Chairperson and PRASA? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I do not know, Chairperson, but if 
you were to allow me an opportunity to deal with this 
statement because, as I said, maybe I have not said it here 
to you but we had meetings and I will deal with what 
20 
transpired in those meetings when Mr Mogashoa came to 
PRASA and then I think it was me and Mr Zide was still 
acting and the legal team was not there and I asked where 
are they?  And I was given an excuse, a reason why they 
are not there and I think I say it in this statement and the 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 101 of 127 
 
next meeting, where is Ms Ngoyi, she is not here, she is 
supposed to be here?  And then I am told – I think the 
excuse then was there was a bereavement at home. 
 
And so, Chairperson, at no stage was anyone 
excluded or told not to come.  And, in any event, 
Chairperson, I am going to deny the version that they have 
put about what Mr Mogashoa told them that I have told him 
and if, Chairperson, thing has a strange feeling, maybe let 
me answer to the specific allegations because there is a 
sequence of the meetings, what was discussed and who 
10 
was there and what transpired later on, Chairperson, but I 
am noting your …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The areas that I particularly want to hear 
what you have to say about it. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, I am noting what you are 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I will address it, Chairperson. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you refer to Mr Botes.  Mr Botes, 
20 
you referred to the fact that he gave evidence and said you 
were the first one – you contacted him first. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the Siyaya clams and it is true, 
that is what he said in his evidence.  You have said that 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 102 of 127 
 
the investigation that has been done by the investigators of 
the Commission suggest that the probabilities are that he 
contacted you first. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he will get a chance to comment on 
that. 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
have 
a 
statement 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of the things he has said is that in 
the discussion that he had with you, I think it was the first 
10 
one, whether he called or you called but that first one  He 
said that you said to him that you had been appointed or 
deployed at PRASA to clean up the mess.  Do you want to 
comment on that? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I filed an affidavit, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you deny that. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I filed an affidavit, it is part of the 
Commission’s record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I have already denied – used the 
20 
word deployed, I said I told him I was deployed by 
President Zuma to PRASA and I said I do not even know 
President Zuma, I have never met him, I have never seen – 
I see him on TV like any ordinary South African and I said 
the only time I have been within a breathing space, that is 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 103 of 127 
 
the word I used, with President Zuma is during the 
inauguration of Dr Nkosazana Zuma at the University of 
Limpopo last year and that is the closest I have ever been.   
 
I am not a politician, I have never been a politician, 
I understand the word deploy is used in those circles but- 
and I said, I also sketched my relationship with Mr Botes, 
that I could not have discussed such things with him, we 
are not close, we are not friends, I do not know what kind 
work he does, he does not even know what kind of work I 
do, we have never been briefed by the same briefing 
10 
attorneys or anything, I have never been to his – so it 
would be strange for me.  You know, Chairperson, now 
when you – you must also understand because throughout 
you kept on using the word it is strange, it is strange, it is 
also strange for me when someone would make those kind 
of allegations to me.  
 
And, you know, you get to a point when here is this 
allegation and then you can only give your version but to 
the mind of the next person it will still not make sense but 
he has not – I do not know if he has denied my assertions 
20 
and remember he – I do not know if he came back to the 
Commission but I told the Commission that this person, I 
laid a complaint against and he says it was dismissed.  I 
said I did not even know it was being considered, he told 
you that I was invited to the disciplinary hearing.  I did not 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 104 of 127 
 
attend.  I do not know if he has come back to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that you deny what he said. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE: Yes, I deny …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   One of the things he said, I might not 
remember the exact wording but it related to what you 
thought of the legal department at PRASA and if I recall 
correctly, he may have suggested that you said that they 
were undermining you or they were not good enough, I 
10 
cannot remember, but he says that is what you said.  Do 
you remember that part in his …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I remember perfectly, Chairperson.  
Remember he is the person that made me to want to come 
and testify because I thought his evidence is out of this 
world.  He used the word I told him I do not trust the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not trust the legal department. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I do not trust the legal team, they 
want to waste PRASA’s money by going to arbitration, they 
20 
are undermining me and I denied and I think in my 
response I referred to his email, the email that we read 
when we started, that he is the person that uses that kind 
of language when he talks to people.  He, in that email, 
that we talked about, Chairperson, he is the one who was 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 105 of 127 
 
intimidating the legal - Mr Mogashoa and Adv Tsatswane 
calling them you are on – I do not know this word, you are 
on the frolic of your own and that kind of language and you 
want to waste money, why do we not settle, why are we 
still going on arbitration?  That is when we started, Chair, I 
said even before I came in the picture Adv Botes was 
persuading the PRASA team to settle the matters.   
 
So with the regard to the undermining part, I have 
in my – in the annexures, the Whatsapps and the SMSes 
that I say I sent but they have not been bundled together, I 
10 
have shown in one way was telling me that the legal team 
and the people at PRASA, I think even the CFO were – 
they are undermining you, you are a person of great 
integrity, these people are undermining you.  So he is the 
one who was telling me that I am being undermined, I have 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How would he have known that they 
were undermining you? 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
Remember 
he 
was 
making 
enquiries about the payment of the claims.  The claims 
20 
were settled in December and then there was a period 
where it appeared there were no problems and then the 
legal team said they cannot authorise the payment, which 
is another thing why it would be strange when the people 
who are going to implement payments saying they have 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 106 of 127 
 
been excluded because everybody knows that when it goes 
for payment, their signature is required at some point. 
 
So I then said to Mr Botes early in January of 2018 
that look, do not make enquiries with me, deal with – I 
think I actually used the word let your attorneys handle 
communication because I cannot help you. 
 
Then he would – he was persistent and then I gave 
him the telephone number of the new CEO who he was 
then 
communicating 
with. 
 
The 
evidence 
is 
there, 
Chairperson, when he packaged the documents you will 
10 
see.  Then he was communicating with the new CEO who 
was promising him that the claims will be paid. 
 
So it is in that context when he – and he will be 
reporting to me that no, today I have spoken to this person 
and this is what I said.  I said look, I am quiet because I 
can see that there are – although they are not saying it out 
loud, I can see – I can hear in the corridors that they are 
making allegations that these claims should not have been 
settled, so I do not want to deal with this matter anymore 
and that is when he was telling me that they are 
20 
undermining you.  It is in that context, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you say you deny that – you deny 
his statement that he said you told him that you did not 
trust the legal department of PRASA. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, yes. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 107 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you trust the legal department of 
PRASA? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I said when we started, we started 
very well, we had meetings where we were going to discuss 
certain issues and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Go closer to the mic. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   We had meetings where we 
discussed certain issues and our discussions were open, 
they were giving me information and then we …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you trust them?  That is the 
10 
question. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   At that stage yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Earlier on. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Earlier on.  Our relationship broke 
down 
because 
I 
did 
not 
even 
know 
they 
were 
not 
supporting the settlement.  Our relationship broke down in 
– after the legal panel of PRASA was suspended, there 
was – the board …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was on the 1 December when it was 
suspended, if I recall correctly. 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes but then the issues came to 
head beginning of the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   When Ms Ngoyi was asked to write 
a report to the board and then she wrote that report which 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 108 of 127 
 
she was not supportive of that decision, the decision had 
already been taken and the report was very critical of the 
board and then that her report was leaked to the media and 
it was then published in some newspapers and then it was 
then used by Unite Behind when they challenged the 
decisions of the interim board. 
 
So then – that is when our relationship, not just 
with me, with the board, broke down.  So from there they 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not trust them after that? 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Well, I had a conversation with her 
that look, the report that you have written to the board, can 
you say something because it is in the newspapers and it 
is being used by people who are challenging the decisions 
or the decisions of the board, can you say something so 
that this issue can calm down?  And she refused to, she 
said no, she is not willing to do that because what she has 
said is correct and I would not want to use the word trust, 
Chairperson, because I do not understand the context or 
the meaning of the word when you say did I trust her or 
20 
not, I am using the word the relationship between legal 
services and the board broke down and then …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not …[intervenes] 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I cannot say because I never had 
any dealings with them after that. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 109 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, we first – we talked about 
Mr Botes’ evidence, that you told him that you did not trust 
PRASA’s legal department. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said you deny that you told him 
that. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question arose out of that to say 
did you trust them? 
JUDGE 
MAKHUBELE: 
 
 
I 
said 
in 
the 
beginning 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you can’t say you understood what 
trust means when I was saying Mr Botes has said you said 
you 
didn’t 
trust 
them, 
but 
you 
don’t 
understand 
it 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   No I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I ask you whether you trusted them. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   No I said in the beginning we had 
a good relationship, but then after the suspension of the 
legal panel there was that discord between them and the 
20 
Board and I never had any dealings with them, so I don’t – 
I don’t, I didn’t use the word trust, I said we had a good 
relationship in the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And then it broke down, not just 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 110 of 127 
 
with me, but with the entire Board, then until – until they 
were working against the Board and I have proof, I will 
prove to the Chairperson that they were working against us 
and until – because Chairperson if – if they had maybe 
because even if it is a board that is not lawful or properly 
constituted there would have been someone in the Board 
that they would have trusted to take the problems to, but 
they never did, and then they were doing their things and 
then going behind everybody’s back until the Minister and 
until the matter is before the Commission today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did you involve them in discussing 
the merits or demerits of settling the Siyaya claims, did 
you have a discussion with them to say as people who had 
been dealing with these claims for some time as the legal 
department before you came you say let’s talk about the 
differences that you are putting up against these claims 
and 
let’s 
look 
at 
the 
evidence, 
did 
you 
have 
that 
engagement with them before you or your Board instructed 
that those claims be settled? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Chairperson I have already 
20 
mentioned that in the – after that first memorandum they 
did not respond to it, they ask ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   They did not? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   They did not respond to the 
memorandum, they instead asked Mr Mogashoa to give a 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 111 of 127 
 
report and the report that Mr Mogashoa was giving was 
about the pleadings, what they have pleaded in court, but 
they, and I mentioned it in my memorandum, that Ms Ngoye 
appeared to have some faint, they were not aware of what 
was happening, if I can put it like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes about the claims. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   About the status of the matter, that 
even the insolvency inquiry, the status of the matter and 
when I enquired and I say it in my statement, that when a 
head of the – and let me correct Ms Ngoye, Ms Ngoye is 
10 
not – does not have, she appears to think she is the 
litigation manager, litigation is the head of three units, 
LRC, Legal, Risk and Compliance, the legal manager is Mr 
Dingiswayo. 
 
So if they do not know the status of the matter 
Chairperson 
and 
I 
say 
it 
in 
my 
statement 
when 
I 
complained about Advocate Botes, it just shows the 
negligent manner in which the matter was being handled 
and you cannot say in future I intend to – I intended to 
plead ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But remember what my question is, my 
question is did you involve them, did you engage them, the 
Legal Department in discussing the merits and demerits of 
settling the Siyaya claims? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Chairperson I said – the answer I 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 112 of 127 
 
give I said I did and they did not give me a report, instead 
they asked their attorney, their external attorney to answer 
on their behalf, I think that is my response. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that their only 
involvement in regard to the process that led to the 
settlement of the Siyaya claims was their involvement 
limited to the fact that you asked for a report from them 
about the status of the matters and they asked the PRASA 
attorney to prepare a report, is that what you are saying, 
or do I misunderstand what you are saying? 
10 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I asked him to prepare a report, 
and I said, but then I want to know from you because yes 
the attorney can prepare a report, but I don’t know 
Chairperson if they have given you any report written by 
them to me on the matters, and before I forget Chairperson 
there’s a document that I am going to give you which is a 
letter that the Board directed should be written to them, Ms 
Ngoye, this is after she had gone to the Minister to say 
give us a report on these matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the Siyaya claims? 
20 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, on the reports on Siyaya, on 
Siyaya, on the evidence, it was in effect asking her that 
since she now says the claims should not have been 
settled can you please provide the Board with information, 
reports from the people that you say are saying, that 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 113 of 127 
 
testified.  Remember she is challenging, I say we consulted 
with those people but then she says no they gave – she 
also consulted, so the Board wanted ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   ...her to address the merits 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no you are going outside my 
question.   Can I put it this way. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From what you are saying it seems to 
10 
me that your answer is yes the only involvement the legal 
department had in the process towards this, that led to the 
settlement of the claims, was when you requested a report 
and they got the attorney to send a report plus what you 
have added but in terms of engaging and discussing the 
merits and the legal issues and why it should be settled, 
the matter should be settled or not be settled that did not 
happen, is that right? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   They did not attend the meetings, I 
think ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of course if they don’t attend the 
meeting that means they do not engage. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I thought I already said that the 
meetings were scheduled and only Mr Mogashoa came and 
then – and remember the reporting lines, they were 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 114 of 127 
 
reporting to the CEO, and then I would be asking the CEO, 
but in this meeting we are supposed to have the mandate, 
he will give a reason why they are not there, and the 
meetings would continue, but they had already given that 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   By Mr – that gives, it was actually 
a status report to say we filed a plea, this is the plea, and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So who exactly was – did you involve in 
10 
discussing the merits and demerits on whether to settle 
these claims and if so at what amounts? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I said in my statement Chairperson 
that there is a delegation of authority, a delegation of 
authority that I have that the Board, my Board was given, 
is attached in some documents and I have also attached 
the email from the Secretary transmitting that delegation of 
authority to the Board members and I have also said the 
reason I am saying this is because I see Ms Ngoye has 
attached her delegation of authority which I do not know, 
20 
but in terms of the authority you now who delegate that 
authority there would be limits for each person or office 
incumbent, so these, the executives which there will be the 
legal manager which is Mr Dingiswayo, he would have legal 
team, he would have his financial limit as the head, overall 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 115 of 127 
 
head of that section.  The Group CEO would have a limit, 
then the Board will have a limit.  The claims fell within the 
delegated authority of a group CEO, so I deny that in terms 
of delegation of authority it was within Ms Ngoye’s 
authority, in terms of the document in my possession she 
did not have that kind of authority, have authority and that 
somewhere and the claims were within the delegated 
authority of the group CEO, not even within the – because 
when – once it gets to above million that would be the 
Board, but between – before one – not one million, 
10 
hundred million ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Don’t worry about the figures because 
we can always ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes but the point I am making is I 
deny that it was within her authority, in terms of the 
documents that were given to the Board and if there’s any 
delegation of authority that she has then she misled the 
Board, or someone misled the Board because the one that I 
have says what I am telling you.    
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that’s fine but you would be aware 
20 
that in her affidavit Ms Ngoye effectively, as I understand 
her evidence, says that the Court rescinded the order that 
it had made on the basis of the arbitration awards that had 
been awarded to, given to the Siyaya companies, on the 
basis that you or the – you did not have authority to settle 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 116 of 127 
 
those claims because in order to settle, to have those 
claims settled, certain procedural steps had to be taken 
which had not been taken.   You would have seen that in 
her affidavit. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I haven’t seen that Chairperson, I 
remember when I say I read her overall affidavit there’s 
somewhere where she says her settlement, the arbitrator 
set aside the settlement, I did not get a sense that it was a 
setting aside by the Court, but what – remember what 
Advocate Botes says, Advocate Botes says PRASA did 
10 
apply to set aside the settlement.  The matter was set 
down for some time I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well this is what happened according to 
the evidence that has been led here. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You instructed that the claims, you and 
your Board, instructed that the Siyaya claims be settled 
and a settlement agreement or agreements, I am not sure, 
were included and from there the PRASA lawyer and the 
Siyaya lawyers went to the arbitrator who was supposed to 
20 
arbitrate the claims, Judge Brand, and said there has been 
settlement, please make the settlement an arbitration 
award by agreement and that was done, and then when 
PRASA did not pay even when that step had been taken 
the 
Siyaya 
companies 
went 
to 
Court 
to 
make 
that 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 117 of 127 
 
arbitration award an order of court.  It was made an order 
of court and subsequently the Legal Department had to 
approach the Court first to interdict the Sheriff from paying 
over PRASA’s money to Siyaya and secondly to rescind the 
order on the basis that you or your Board had no authority 
to settle the matters.  That is what she says. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   No Chairperson.  Chairperson is 
reading the documents wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Let me correct you.   The – before 
10 
under this case number that I said there’s an affidavit yes 
the awards of Judge Brand were based on the settlement.  
Then Judge Holland-Müter made the arbitration awards 
orders of Court.  Then PRASA went to Court to interdict the 
Sheriff, because the minute they were made orders of 
Court then the Sheriff attached I think it was – it was 
money, not I think. 
 
Then 
PRASA 
went 
to 
Court 
to 
challenge 
the 
warrants, to set aside the warrants whilst waiting to 
rescind the orders of Acting Judge Holland-Müter.  That 
20 
application came before Judge Tuchten rescinded the 
orders that made the arbitration awards orders of court.  
That’s when Judge Tuchten said the settlement is still in 
force and Makhubele will have her day when there is an 
application 
to 
set 
aside 
the 
settlement 
agreements 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 118 of 127 
 
because that is where I was involved, but in the meantime 
if that enforcement application, you called it enforcement 
application, to enforce the settlement, is not – there won’t 
be an appropriate forum, then Makhubele there must be 
another forum for Makhubele to state her case, so as far 
as the Courts are concerned that – those settlements have 
not been set aside and then Advocate Botes says the 
matter was set down to decide on the fate of those 
settlements, but then it was removed from the roll I think 
last year, that is the status. 
10 
 
So that is the status Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
but 
you 
do 
accept 
that 
...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:     So then what was being said Ms 
Ngoye in her affidavit said she is going to join me when 
there is that application to set aside the settlement 
agreement.  Remember now I am the one who acted 
unlawfully, and without my involvement obviously, I mean 
in those proceedings if I decide to oppose, and I don’t 
think I would have wanted to get involved, because I don’t 
20 
know but I say in my statement I have never been – I have 
never been found guilty, that is what I am emphasizing that 
no one, no Court has ever found me guilty of anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say about the complaint 
that you were running a board that did not have a quorum, 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 119 of 127 
 
that all of these things that were being done by the Board 
was being done by a Board that was not constituted in 
terms of the applicable act and it had no authority to do 
anything until it was properly constituted. 
 
As I understand the Act, and you must tell me if you 
understand 
yours 
differently, 
it 
is 
different, 
my 
understanding is that you needed, your board needed to 
have seven members, some of whom had to have certain 
expertise but your Board only had six members and that 
the minutes will show that there was no meeting during 
10 
your time, or rather some of the minutes where meetings 
apparently were held show six members or five members, I 
don’t know whether the meeting of the 16 t h of March there 
was a new member which came, what do you say about 
that?   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   There is an application before the 
Western Cape High Court on that very matter Chair, I 
would not want to venture and answer without properly 
applying my mind, it is a legal argument that I – it is before 
Court and PRASA filed an affidavit to reply to that, I was 
20 
not kept abreast, I was not certain if the matter, but I am 
not certain if the matter has been finalised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no ...[intervenes]  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And I would not, I know there’s an 
argument that was placed before Court, I will have to – I 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 120 of 127 
 
will have to refresh my mind about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine because we are not 
finishing today. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is something quite important 
because 
my 
own 
understanding 
is 
that 
one 
of 
the 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
any 
meeting, 
including a Board meeting, is to first satisfy themselves 
that there is a quorum before they can do any business 
and therefore one would expect that is something that you 
10 
would have looked at and probably you have a view as to w 
whether that what they say is correct or not.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes well as I say I believe there is 
a legal argument that is afoot, I don’t want to venture it, it 
is quite a long time, I need to read the papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine. The last question 
for today, for this evening for me is, one I talked about 
something that I said seemed strange to me, another one 
that seem strange to me is that the so-called settlement of 
the 
Siyaya 
claims 
your 
instruction, 
or 
your 
Board’s 
20 
instruction was effectively as reflected in the settlement 
was effectively that PRASA must pay exactly in regard to 
each of I think about four claims the amount that was 
claimed and the interest that was, the interest I think 
running from the date of service of summons, the only 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 121 of 127 
 
thing that I think wasn’t there is that PRASA must pay 
costs.  That didn’t seem to me a usual settlement.   In a 
settlement one 
would normally see that the plaintiff 
claimed five million but the actual settlement is less than 
that, because the parties are trying to settle so that they 
don’t end up in court.  Are you able to say anything about 
that? 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Not at this stage Chairperson, as I 
said when I was dealing with that report and that the 
evidence of – or rather the submissions of the relevant 
10 
people with regard to – remember with some claims there 
would have been, the issue is the amount and then they 
would have indicated that the correct amount is here and I 
don’t want to venture and answer without looking into the 
documents but I have noted your question and your – 
rather your – what makes you feel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Some of this what I consider to be, what 
seemed to me to be strange features. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   To be strange yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, which you might be able to explain 
20 
and once you have explained they might not be strange. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes, and I may not be able to 
explain that but then I am – you know Chairperson 
remember there are submissions by a person who says she 
is not trying to tell this Commission that her contentions 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 122 of 127 
 
are correct and she is someone who has these strange 
feelings about documents and obviously those who were 
there must be able to explain Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no it is fine. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   So it is a – but at the end of the 
day I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a way of being fair to you to say you 
must know what is weighing in my mind so that you can 
address it properly.   
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I have seen that and I have seen 
10 
Mr Mogashoa’s response, because you know when things 
happen in the presence of attorneys they would know what 
to 
call 
the 
letter, 
you 
write 
without 
prejudice, 
with 
prejudice, it is a settlement, it is what, and it is things that 
happen under direction of legal advice.  It is only lawyers 
who would be able to explain the wording and I would say I 
relied on these explanations but I first need to look at the 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  We are going to 
adjourn now, you must then remember that next time you 
20 
must have – you must have looked at all the documents 
that you may wish to look at so that we can deal with 
everything, but in particular you will remember for when we 
resume next time that you will be looking – among other 
things you will be looking at the issue of what work you did 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 123 of 127 
 
at Water Tribunal arising from the fact that I said the letter 
that the Judge President wrote to the Minister about the 
deferment of your appointment gave your work at the Water 
Tribunal as the reason. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   I said I don’t have that letter, can 
someone ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, you will get the letter. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Can someone give me that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
that 
letter 
as 
well 
as 
the 
correspondence from the Water Tribunal, as I said to you, 
10 
they said there was only one appeal but even that one 
appeal was on the head in 2017 and not in 2018 so you 
can look at all of those things, you can also have a look 
and be able to say here are cases I don’t know what they 
are talking about that I was involved in and in terms of 
wrapping 
up 
your 
legal 
practice 
also 
you 
gave 
us 
information, you said you appeared in seven courts, what 
you are able to give us. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   And I will also give you what we 
were doing at PRASA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja, do that as well. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Because of this belief that there 
was an obsession with the one matter, and Chairperson if I 
may also say I will also, I did indicate to you that I would 
also – I was reading the rules that if part of my response 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 124 of 127 
 
will point to irregularities, remember the affidavit of Ms 
Ngoye says she wants to highlight the – where the leaders 
were found wanting in various reports of AG’s, PP and 
National Treasury, and Chairperson I must say right now 
that she only talks about me as a person, as if I am – I was 
there alone, but she does not talk about herself, there are 
irregularities involving her, Ms Ngoye and Mr Dingiswayo 
which I am going to talk about and require an investigation 
by this Commission because once I mention it there is that 
obligation.   
10 
 
She doesn’t talk about the irregularities under the 
Board of Mr Popo Molefe, which I am also going to talk 
about.  She only wants to talk about me as if I am just this 
branch, literally branch that was put there at PRASA with 
just on my own you know without – and she forgets about 
herself and the other Boards where there are irregularities 
that have been flagged by the Auditor General.  We need to 
talk 
about 
everything, 
irregularities, 
corruption, 
maladministration does not change its name depending on 
who is involved. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no, no that is fine.   We are 
going to adjourn, I indicated on Monday that I was looking 
at the 17h of August.  I am going to fix that date but that is 
– that may change because the Commission will talk to 
your JP but you indicated on Monday that you might wish 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 125 of 127 
 
to talk to him as well to see if you can get some leave so 
that you can attend to this matter. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Properly, so we will adjourn to the 17 t h 
but between now and the 17 t h there will be communication 
between the Commission and yourself and the JP.  That 
date might stand, the date might change, but everybody 
will be advised. 
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:  I may mention through you Chair 
that I have already sent the communication to JP Mlambo 
10 
last night that I require time, I have requested that he must 
grant me special leave, because remember it is not just 
this matter, the JSC is sitting in October, so I want to deal 
with all these matters without the pressures of work, so I 
am looking at being released for quite some time to attend 
to all these matters because Chair I need – I also need to 
obtain the services of someone to assist me to draft the 
affidavits that I must draft so I am going to follow up with 
JP what his position is but I don’t just want to released for 
a week, I want time to deal with all these matters, but we 
20 
should know maybe before the end of this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay no that’s fine.  
JUDGE MAKHUBELE:   But thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Judge Makhubele.  Mr Soni 
do you want to say something? 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 126 of 127 
 
ADV SONI SC:   Yes.  Chairperson before we adjourn you 
will recall that on Monday besides the question of Judge 
Makhubele testifying today you had raised the question of 
the status of the legal team, namely whether we would 
continue our participation or not, and it depended as I 
understood it on heads of argument being filed by Judge 
Makhubele on Friday and our filing heads of argument by 
Wednesday next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that still stands ja. 
ADV SONI SC:  We would like that to stand. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that still stands. 
ADV SONI SC:   Because I must just say it is a bit 
awkward for me sitting as a leader of the legal team in this 
matter to be sitting as a participant, as a spectator in this 
matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no that directive stands, so and 
as I indicated it might be that I will decide the issue or it 
might be that I might find a practical solution to it but that 
does not  - obviously if I find a practical solution to it 
anyone who would not have filed there might be no need to 
20 
file anything but until everyone is advised to the contrary 
that directive about Judge Makhubele filing her written 
submissions this Friday and the Commission’s legal team 
filing its on written submissions on or before Wednesday 
next week stands. 
05 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 245 
 
Page 127 of 127 
 
 
Okay, alright. 
ADV SONI SC:   Chairperson we submit it is an important 
issue and I have not discussed it with the other members 
of the legal team and the Commission but one can expect 
that this sort of onslaught on the integrity of members of 
the legal team is going to continue unless the parameters 
within which the withdrawal or recusal or whatever one 
wants to call it is properly set Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much to everybody for 
staying on until this time. We are going to adjourn and as I 
10 
said the matter is postponed to the 17 t h of August at ten 
o’clock, unless the time is changed and the date might 
change, but until there is an advice that it has changed it 
will remain the 17 t h. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 6 AUGUST 2019
